White Caucasian.\n\nConditions: Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Asperger's Syndrome\n\nMedicine: Lexapro (escitalopram)\n\nSo as the title states, I'm constantly feeling like I need to eat every 3 hours. It started 4 months ago when I did have a glucose crash due to being really sick I went to the hospital and had it corrected. Was discharged.\n\nBut ever since then I've felt like I need to eat every 3 hours. Its almost 3 hours on the dot. For example, if I eat at 7, then my body will want me to eat at 10, then 1, then 3, etc... and if I eat st 10, then eat at 11, it'll reset to 2 pm. It's even keeping me up at night. I'll wake up every  3 hours at night and need to eat.\n\n\nAfter feeling like this for 2 months, I saw my doctor. She suspected diabetes it hypoglycemia because they run in my family.\n\nDid all sorts of tests and the cane back Negative.\n\nBlood glucose: normal. Test came back as follows:\n\nTest 1: 5.8 (just ate 15 minutes before  test)\n\nTest 2: 4.5 (haven't eaten in 8 hours)\n\nTest 3: 5.2 (3 hours after drinking a special liquid)\n\n\nGlucose in urine: Negative.\n\nProteinuria: Negative.\n\nHBA1C: 4.8, which is in optimal range.\n\nTSH: 1.4 which is completely normal.\n\nDoctors conclude I dont have diabetes or hypoglycemia, but the symptoms persist.\n\nWhen it happens, my feet feel weak, I start sweating, get really anxious, shake sometimes, and feel out of it. When it happens I get restless and I'll tap my foot impatiently or start panicking. Sometime I feel like I'm going to pass out.\n\nSome people have suggested its side effects from my anxiety medication, lexapro. Others say it's OCD. I don't know what to think anymore. nobody I've spoken to seems to have an answer and its just increasing my anxiety and leaving me frustrated.\n\n\nAny ideas as to what us going on? I cant keep going on like this."

I have combination skin with dry patches, and also have Keratosis Pilaris. When I remember the issues with these \u201cbeads\u201d started to bother me, I was not on any medication or birth control. I was approx 13-14y/o. My hair is currently approx 22in long, is fine and wavy/straight (more straight now with the weight of the length), and is regular thickness. I do get frizz around roots and a little lower. \n\nI do sometimes suffer from dandruff flakes, mainly around my hairline and hair part. Not always though. The little \u201cbeads\u201d are not always present, but tend to be if my hair starts to get oily or after 2 days since I last washed it (despite my hair usually not looking gross and it only being a little bit oily). If I leave washing my hair for too long (3-4+ days, thx depression) my scalp does start to get itchy. They are not lice eggs/nits and I have never had lice. I have had it looked at in the past, but it was brushed off since it wasn\u2019t that. \n\nI\u2019ve noticed that typically when I hit a period of depression and am not washing my hair as much, this tends to be a thing. I also have been wearing my hair back in a loose ponytail to sleep and majority of the day to keep it out of my face as my acne has been living its best life :~) . When I remember being bothered by it most (when I first remember it starting / really bothering me) I used to twist and pin my hair up overnight very often to get more defined waves/curls. I think this could have some correlation. \n\nI have also noticed in the last 6mo or so, my hair has been shedding like crazy. I notice when I part it or pull it back, I can see the colour of my scalp a bit (although nothing super crazy that others would judge per say). I can\u2019t tell if it\u2019s stress, hormones (got my kyleena late September 2018, acne has come back swingin\u2019 since), product buildup or something else \u2014 and if this correlates with these little beads. I don\u2019t typically use any product at the top of my hair if any at all after showering (I usually just use shampoo and a hair mask on my ends or conditioner). \n\nIf you have any ideas of possible causes, things to check/test or things to bring up with my GP (and/or dermatologist when I see her), please let me know."

        "reddit": "38/White Female, 5\u20193\u201d and 120 pounds. Location: PA, USA. Duration of complaint: as long as I can remember. My chief complaint is being exhausted all the time with a associated brain fog. Not just a little tired, but debilitating exhaustion to the point where I have barely gotten by in school and work. I have been diagnosed in the past with narcolepsy and ADHD in the past and have been prescribed modafinil in the past. I am presently taking Adzenys. I have some doubts about my narcolepsy diagnosis, because a second sleep study ruled it out. I do believe that I have ADD (inattentive type) due to a severe lack of focus, despite putting forth maximum effort. I credit the modafinil and Adzenys with allowing me to function as a normal human being at work and in my personal life. When I do not take these medications, I usually can not get through a day without taking a nap, even after 7-9 hours of sleep. During the weekends I take a drug holiday from all stimulants and during this time, I have severe brain fog and am completely exhausted. My fianc\u00e9 has taken notice that during the weekends, I have a lack of focus, I need extra naps, and that I gravitate to higher carb foods and caffeinated beverages to get quick energy. I have complained about this in the past and this complaint was brushed aside because it\u2019s so non-specific and probably an annoying and expensive work up. I am also told that many women my age are diagnosed with something called \u201cMiddle Age Woman\u201d syndrome (how quaint). I\u2019ve had some lab work and Anemia has been ruled out, my thyroid is fine, and my CBC and BMP are normal. The only thing elevated was my Epstein-Barr level and honestly, who hadn\u2019t had mono? I have depression which is being treated with Lexapro and it has helped a lot. I also was recently diagnosed with interstitial cystitis. Elmiron has really helped with this and occasionally at night, I will take a short acting oxybutynin which has also been helpful. I work out about 3-5 x/ week (when I have the energy from being on meds) and eat a generally healthy diet (when on my meds). Associated symptoms include weird pains that are like right under my skin - like not my skin itself and not my muscle. I believe another name for this is allodynia. The pain is usually in my upper back and my upper arms. The pain is  weird and annoying but not excruciating. I have moderate to severe seasonal allergies which I treat with a steroidal nasal spray and Zyrtec. When my allergies are bad, my skin will itch and I\u2019ll become very congested. Sorry for the long post - I know it\u2019s a lot of information and I appreciate whoever is reading this. I am getting desperate because I feel like I\u2019ve been dismissed by many providers. I really do not want to have to rely on stimulant medications if there is an underlying condition that could be fixed. I know that I\u2019ll probably be on Adzenys forever but I want to be able to function as a semi - normal human and not be debilitatingly exhausted during my drug holidays."

Mupirocin as needed.\n\nRecreational drugs: N/A\n\nSmoking status: N/A\n\nPhoto included\n\n\nFYI I have a desk job and dont like being in the sun. I sweat easily and a lot. I don't like sodas. I drink 8 bottles of water a day. Been drinking water like that since 2014. I started noticing light spots on the backs of my thighs in 2016. Soon they crept down to my legs . Then eventually they were everywhere. I have had 3 different Dermatologists and 2 biopsies thus far. 2nd test was sent to some special lab in Atlanta,GA. My current doctor wants to do a 3rd biopsy. I don't see the point. All the tests have shown negative for everything. First doc thought it was some form of lupus. 2nd doc thought it was some form of yeast infection or excema. Now this 3rd doc thinks it's vitiligo and wants me to start doing light treatments twice a week at\u00a0$500\u00a0a pop. What am I rich? I have absolutely no other symptoms. No itching, burning, peeling or flaking. It has always just been a cosmetic issue thank god. But now that I can't hide it under my clothes anymore it's affecting my self esteem. Back when these spots made their debut is right around the same time I was initially diagnosed with Type II Diabetes. The first meds prescribed was Metformin. I really think it has changed my body. I started having all kinds of gut issues that I never had before. Got so bad I had to go to the emergency room. I could barely walk everyday the pain in my abdomen was so bad. Doc said my body wasn't taking well to that medicine so switched to Victoza. Got well but went right back to gut issues. Then switched to Trulicity and Jardiance. I still have gut issues from time to time but not half as bad as it was when I was on Metformin. My dermatologists have proscribed the following creams: Topicort 0.05%, Fluocinolone 0.025%, Triamcinolone Acetonide 0.1%, Desonide 0.05%, Desoximetasone 0.05% and Elidel 1%. The last doc also had me try ointment: Eucrisa 2%. None of these meds have worked. For each of them I tried it out for 2-3 months only on isolated body parts so I could monitor and contain any potential adverse affects. I have also tried home remedies like apple cider vinegar and selenium sulfide 1% to rub on affected skin twice a day. I've also taken orally Diflucan 150 mg 3 doses 1 tablet every 3 days. Did that a few times. No change. I don't believe this is vitiligo. Seems vitiligo is more akin to patches of light areas instead of tiny spots everywhere.\u00a0 I feel I need to also include a history of my skin conditions. Growing up I never had issues with skin as a teenager. Never had much acne only the lonely pimple maybe once a year. In 2007 I moved to FL for a year and then came back home to AL with weird blisters growing all over my face. Local clinic tried to tell me it was a form of HPV. Didn't believe it at the time didn't start having sex until 2009. In 2008 a doctor diagnosed me with muluscum. Had it about 4-6 months. Doc prescribed Aldara 5% cream that was $300-400 for 12 doses per box and had to use 2 doses a day. I couldn't afford anymore after first box. It didn't work. Tried home remedy using\u00a0$4\u00a0bottle of Dr. Tichenor's antiseptic mouthwash on the blisters cleared it up in two weeks!\u00a0Smh. About that same time started getting boils all over my body. Didn't know what they were at first and let a few grow huge and painful. Had a few lanced at the hospital. Fast forward years later 2016 when I started seeing dermatologists for the spots also talked to them about the boils. Was told it's from staph infection. One doc said I should take bleach baths to keep the boils away. Tried it but stopped after a while just don't like the idea of bleach in my bath water. Another doctor prescribed Mupirocin 2%. I am to use directly on the boils. Also told to rub inside my nose daily to prevent them from forming. It works like a charm. But I assume I gotta use this stuff for the rest of my life? I have also tried using the Dr. Tichenor's on my spots. No changes. Ok hope I covered everything...Anybody seen this crap before? Any suggestions on treatments? I'm bout done paying money for doctors to tell me nothing and prescribe s every medication that doesn't work. \ufffd\ufffd"

The nails began to crumble and fall out. They now never grow back attached and I have to keep them well clipped. If I even try to grow them back I seem to hit them off things without fail and the pain of the trauma of the small bump is absolutely agony and it's like they go \"Oh well :)\" and detach again. Even if I don't they'll find other ways to detach or just flat out not attach to the nailbed properly when growing out.   \n\n\nThe sides of the nails don't seem to want to settle and stay with the skin, so I think the shape of the nail beds must be ruined by it also. Also, the skin on my right palm peels constantly: it's difficult to see in the pic because I made the mistake of applying vaporub to them in a current attempt to try and get my palm not look so messed up so the oiliness is hiding the flakiness. They look disgusting and I just know people (girls especially) must look at them and go eww wtf don't want those filthy things near me. Any advice on what exactly it is and what I can do? I've been told it might be nail fungus but the online info about this for fingernails or what it is seems to be so limited. I'm not usually a self-conscious person about a lot but constantly seeing these and the agony of knocking them off things has pushed me to breaking point so I need to know how the hell to get rid of these things. I'm sick of being told \"Oh they'll grow back, just be patient\" Been told that years and they just won't; they refuse to.   \n\n\nSorry for the rant. Any help would really be appreciated."

He seriously has all that stuff and it's all chronic. I mainly want to know how unusual it is that he's still alive (knock on wood lol) and what the reason could be. I have been reading this sub and when I see things about liver failure the case always seems dire and serious. \n\nWhen I was a baby my mom noticed my dad was yellow after tanning. She told him he needed to go to the er. He went and was diagnosed with liver failure caused by hep c,  he was 35. His belly swelled up, he was weak, thin, and sick, it scarred me for my childhood seeing that much illness and spending that much time with him as a 2 year old in the hospital. He was given 6 months. A few months later his stomach got so swollen it busted. From the belly button(I know this is crazy but he really has no belly button, there is a stitched line across his stomach where it used to be). That night his stomach busted they told us to go home, that he'd be dead by morning. My dad told us that he \"was freezing cold in the bed waiting to die when something covered him up and told him it was okay and he was warm again. We came back the next day and he made a turn around. He stopped drinking, his liver function went back up (still failure but not impending death failure) and for a few years we did well, dr had him on milk thistle and other meds and he did good. Then 4 years later he started drinking again...a lot. Over the next 10 years his liver was constantly getting worse then better. At this time the main issue was internal bleeding and free bleeding also. Any little cut and he bleeds like crazy. His esophagus would open up with ulcers and cause internal bleeding after a weekend of heavy drinking and had go to the dr, have a blood transfusion or something, recover, get lectured that he only had months to live if he didn't stop. Then leave and the cycle continues. \n\nFast forward 2008. Hes using drugs again (he quit when I was born after 20 years of heroin use), he is as healthy as he can be as a alcoholic, smoking,drug addict with liver failure when his house catches fire. He escapes after jumping out a window but not before getting burns on his hands and smoke inhalation. His vocal cords were damaged and he now speaks with a raspy, gruff voice that no one can understand. He now has emphysema from the fire. Not helped by him smoking still. He literally smoked the day he was released from the dr. He now gets pneumonia a lot. Like he actually has a bout of it now. He is terrible at taking antibiotics so he usually never fully recovers. Pneumonia is a regular thing for him, monthly during summer, bi weekly or worse during winter.\n\nWhere we are currently is a mess of different illnesses that come and go. Diabetes doesn't run in my family. He has diabetes when he has drank so much his pancreas and liver can't take his cramp anymore. His sugar drops and he will collapse and have to go to the er. This is rare but happens if he drinks a lot of liquor. He has pancreatitis now and then. His kidneys aren't bad, one barely functions but the other is fine, no dialysis but impaired functions. He has bad emphysema and copd. He hasn't had bleeding in a while. The congestive heart failure is only present during severe pneumonia,  usually in the winter.\n\nThe explanations by drs about his survival are, stubbornness, miracle, some are like...how?, others wonder if it is a birth defect he has, liver choristomas? Somehow providing blood flow better to his liver.\n\nThe docs described his liver to us as having so much scar tissue that it is like a painted sponge. I should also note he's not the only member of his family to survive serious illness for way longer than expected.  His brother shot himself in the stomach playing Russian roulette and lost part of his liver, stomach, spleen,pancreas, and developed mouth cancer and stomach cancer but lived for like 15 years. We don't know how.  He man literally smoked through a stoma and poured beer in his feeding tube. Who does that?  His sister just got her leg amputated from basically diabetes cause by severe drinking. \n\nThis is true to the best of my knowledge. I can try obtaining some records from him, perhaps I can even get him to do a video interview to put it on YouTube some day but most days as you can imagine he's not feeling great. He says his liver functions aren't always that bad."

I had also anxiety, which is gone for a month, but this anxiety made me to go to toilet like hundred times a day. With this I found some blood from my rectum. I had colonosopy where they found hemorrhoids and they told me just change diet. Which I did, I increased my fiber and so on but this nausea and stomache still continues. I havent bled from my rectum for a while but last two weeks it's just worse and worse because of how much I go on toilet. I don't have stress or anxiety but I have a lot of bowel movements. I don't eat too much but I have to go on toilet like 10 times a day which is not normal for me. My stool is not watery, it is solid but little bit soft and often jelly like.

        "reddit": "This question is not about me, it\u2019s about my sister (22 F, height 5\u20197, weight 125, Caucasian, doesn\u2019t smoke or drink, relevant medical issues include history of endometriosis - treated surgically and with Lupron - and pretty severe vaginismus. Duration of complaint is 6-7 hours or so). \n\nShe had an IUD inserted on Thursday - the goal of the IUD was to see if it would improve her chronic headaches. This was the second attempt. The first time doctors tried to do the insertion, they couldn\u2019t physically do it. Apparently she has a very severe case of vaginismus (probably partially psychological, partially physical, as a potential consequence of endometriosis/surgery). This isn\u2019t surprising though, as she had horrible, horrible muscle spasms for months after her last laparoscopy that required baclofen to treat. She had the IUD inserted in the OR under anesthesia.\n\nThings seemed to be going alright for the first few days. Some cramping, but minimal. Now things have taken a turn for the worse. She had a semi-active day (just running some errands, nothing too strenuous) and in the evening she started having severe cramping/spasms. A small amount of bleeding too, but not very much at all. The pain is very intense. 20mg of baclofen and 600mg of naproxen barely touched it. Nearly an hour after taking the baclofen, she finally started to get a little bit better, to the point where she sat on the couch for a while in only moderate pain. She recently moved upstairs, and the pain is back and just as severe as before. She took additional Tylenol and it doesn\u2019t seem to be helping. She describes the pain as similar to when she had spasms post-surgery, but maybe \u201ca little different\u201d (isn\u2019t in a state to elaborate on what this means). \n\nHere\u2019s the thing - she has a history of *severe* pain, and a very high pain threshold. It takes a lot to send her to the ER. I think it\u2019s only happened once before. My family is starting to think an ER visit is necessary, but she\u2019s resisting for two reasons:\n\n1. Her history of severe vaginismus is a confounding factor so it\u2019s very hard to tell what level of pain is \u201cnormal\u201d\n2. She\u2019s convinced that if she goes to the ER, they\u2019ll insist on taking it out. She doesn\u2019t want to do this because then the whole process of getting it inserted in the OR would have been a waste (and she wouldn\u2019t have even gotten a chance to see if it helps with her headaches), and also because the process of removing it would likely be quite painful and traumatic without the help of some heavier-duty anesthetic. She can\u2019t even have a normal pelvic exam (inserting one finger causes severe pain). I have no idea how someone would remove it. \n\nShe obviously hasn\u2019t been able to check the string either. I\u2019m at a loss of what to do. She\u2019s determined to ride it out, but she\u2019s been sobbing for hours now and I\u2019m getting desperate."

I did a few standard tests- a holter monitor for 48 hours and a echocardiogram. Nothing significant came back so my doctor ordered a tilt table test. Due to work and schooling I wasn\u2019t able to do it until this summer. So end of June I do the tilt table test. \n\nThey put me at a 75 degree angle and for the first twenty minutes nothing significant happened. After twenty minutes they give me nitroglycerin to try and induce symptoms. My heart rate skyrocketed and I passed out. Apparently while I was unconscious it got to the point where they were no longer able to get a blood pressure on me and my heart stopped beating for 15 seconds.  I also projectile vomited while I was unconscious. \n\nAfter this I saw the on-call cardiologist and he cleared me to go home after they ran fluids on me. I saw my cardiologist and she has referred me to see an electrophysiologist who I will be seeing at the end of this month. I\u2019m currently wearing a Ziopatch for 14 days. \n\nI take Daysee (birthcontrol), Lamictal and Vraylar medication wise. I have asthma and bipolar disorder. \n\nDespite seeing two cardiologist they really haven\u2019t explained to me why my heart stopped beating. So that\u2019s my question, why did my heart stop beating during my tilt table test?"

Going upstairs or waking up almost qualified as pain. I did not exercise at the time but it just seemed excessive and something was wrong. Got an Oximeter, discovered my heartrate averaged between 130-160 just standing or walking around. Monitored this and my bloodpressure for months. Oxygen was constantly perfect. I averaged at about 140 BPM for most of the day every day. But would frequently fluctuate to 160. Keep in mind I would not notice at all when it went high, I was completely obvious to it, I would've had no idea if it wasn't for the monitor.\n\nI even made footage of me waking up, with my heart at 80bpm, putting my heart monitor on and climbing out of bed. It climbed to 140bpm in about 30 seconds.\n\nCompletely changed lifestyle, exercised every day, extremely strict diet w/sugar caffine ect, virtually every aspect of my life was monitored and experimented with. No change.\n\nInvestigation escalated and a mountain of tests were done. I was finally sent to the hospital while at 190 BPm just standing around. It went back down to about 130bpm and I was in shock how much the hospital was panicking about it because this was my normal for like 5 years.  I was given a quick acting betablocker for the first time and cried my eyes out over how much clarity and calmness it gave me. Since then it keeps my heart from surpassing 160bpm and was the first time I'd ever in my life seen my heart anywhere near the 70bpm range. However it still averages at about 130.\n\nAfter the beta blocker I also gained about 10 pounds.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThyroid check, nothing\n\nDiabetes check, nothing\n\nHeart echo, Nothing\n\nCystoscopy, Nothing\n\nXrays, nothing\n\nBlood tests, at one point Iron was a bit low but I was having a period that was lasting over a month at the time. Period stopped, my bloodtests showed iron was back to normal.\n\nECG, nothing outside of obvious tachycardia no irregular heartbeat or anything like that.\n\nElectrolytes, nothing\n\nCancer/tumor/cysts, nothing\n\n24 Hour Heart monitor, confirmed I was at least going down to 80bpm in my sleep\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCardiologist said that it must be psychological and pretty much ended the investigation. As I do have bad anxiety issues, however when I went to an extremely qualified psychologist she said it was virtually impossible for tachycardia like this to stay so consistently from anxiety, at most being short bursts.\n\nPsychologist wants me to investigate further because something is obviously wrong but we don't know where to turn next.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am currently a bit weary of exercise. I have a bike and it always immediately jumps to 160. Since I got the beta blocker it doesn't feel like pure agony but I still worry I'm playing dangerous games trying to exercise. Is it safe/recommended right now?"

I have inflammation everywhere in my body with high wbc and c-reactive of 24. \n\nI've been tested for lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, and sjogren's syndrome, all negative but I've had positives in all 3 several times. More negative than positive though.\n\nInflammation is bacterial but I've been on 4 antibiotics this year and nothing has helped.\n\nThis pain started July 2011, about 8 weeks after brain surgery. Started in my stomach and now it is everywhere. \n\nHere are the doctors I currently see that are clueless as to what is going on:\n\nPulmonologist - swelling around my lungs and states that it is starting to go around my heart. Put me on a med that starts with \"C\" but can't remember what it's called. Hurts to breathe and feels like I'm stabbed if my body is touched around it. Swelled especially around my sternum (something called an odd name with an \"x\" \n\nGastroenterologist - my duodenum is highly inflammatory so I got put on the fodmap diet. It helps but inflammation will not go away. Had 2 polyps removed from my upper intestines that were too big for how old they were since I had the same test done last year and now have to have one next year from it. I also have internal hemorrhoids if that matters. \n\nCardiologist - my heart rate raises very high easily for no known reason. Tilt table test is inconclusive because I raise only 28, not 30. But I can't do stress tests because my heart rate jumps to over 200 in less than 6 minutes. I pass out if I get too hot so I can't do too much outside. I had a test where they checked my muscles and my right side is weaker but that is probably because I had brain surgery on my left side. (temporal and occipital lobes removed) \n\nENT- Swollen lymph nodes in my neck on the right side for over 3 years. Pain is getting worse. Will possibly need surgery to remove the worse ones. \n\nGynecologist - lots of pain so blame is endometriosis which probably makes sense but it hurts so bad. I was stage 3 two years ago and need a hysterectomy. \n\nUrologist - kidney and bladder pain. Just had a huge kidney cyst removed and my bladder tied up. Lots of pain in these areas for 6 years. \n\nFoot and hand doctors - several surgeries have been done to remove hard lumps and to reset my feet. I grow lipomas and cysts like crazy in these places, along with my back and arms. Right now, my feet and ankle are swelling if I even try to walk and they feel like they are going to break. I was told it was my tendons swelling and she had no idea why - it had to be from something else. \n\nNeurologist - seizures are coming back 8 years after having surgery and it's probably from the stress I'm going through with all this. \n\nAll my doctors except gyno are telling me I need to go to the Cleveland Clinic to figure this out. My whole body hurts so bad and I hate that nobody knows what is going on. \n\nWhat kind of doctor should I even see in Cleveland? I'll be referred to a pulmonologist but I don't think that will help. I need to get this figured out soon because I'm pretty sure I can't take this much longer. I just graduated from college and I want to work and have a normal life. Please help me."

I haven\u2019t had any caffeinated drinks in months at that point due to high sensitivity to caffeine and I didn\u2019t like the crash. But I used to drink 50 mg-100 mg and felt fine, jittery on the higher end of the spectrum though.\n\nSo I slowly sipped the coffee with a blueberry muffin and bottle of water that I downed with it. I felt fine, felt really good actually. Well at 2 PM, I vaporized some marijuana for the first time in a while and took some CBD oil with it to relax myself. I hadn\u2019t had any marijuana in a week at that point so i had a really low tolerance but I was feeling really good, just playing video games and relaxing. \n\nWell at around 6 pm, I felt the caffeine crash kicking in so I had another couple of hits from my vaporizer. I\u2019ve also been drinking a bunch of water all day because I keep getting thirsty. \n\nWell 2 hours later when the high wore off at 8 pm, I really started getting hit. I got a headache and slight nausea for a while before it hit me like a train at 8:30 or so and I was in a full blown panic attack/crash/sickness/whatever it was. It felt identical to a bad hangover; weakness, nausea, headache, sinus pressure, anxiety, feeling really cold... I felt so cold once it hit me like a train that I thought I was dying and it sent me into a panic attack which only made it worse. I had to lay under the many blankets in my bed for 20 minutes or so to get my body temp back to normal. \n\nThen it was about 2-3 hours of rocking back and forth trying to avoid going into a full blown panic attack and trying to stay awake because I felt so weak and sick that I thought I was dying like I said. These are all the exact feelings that I felt when I had a horrible hangover a couple of months ago as well. \n\nIt could potentially have been food poisoning on top of those two because I cooked chicken for dinner that turned out a little funky. It wasn\u2019t pink or anything but you never know. I definitely threw it all up that night and then felt a lot better after that. \n\nAnyone have any idea what happened so I can prevent that from ever happening again? I will stop drinking caffeine if that\u2019s what it takes. I didn\u2019t think 35 mg would do anything... i got a small cup with 1/4 of it regular coffee and 3/4 decaf coffee. I\u2019m just not understanding what is doing this to me... is it a panic attack or is it a caffeine crash or is it general sickness? Food poisoning?"

My doctors don\u2019t know what to tell me. I keep getting worse and I\u2019m super bummed right now.\n \nI had my first hypertensive crisis when I was 22. 200/130 for no damn reason. They\u2019d happen a few times a week and be pretty normal in between most of the time so the first few years everyone thought I must have some kind of anxiety disorder, even though I didn\u2019t feel like I had anxiety. My life was dope and I was otherwise super healthy and happy.\n \nThen I got pregnant and shit got bad. My blood pressure was still super labile but seemed to get higher throughout the day. Like 100/60 in the morning and 180/120 evening. After delivery (healthy baby!) the blood pressure stayed shit and my heartrate also began to get weird. It would get stuck at like 160 for a few hours just sitting around. Diagnosis- being a mom is stressful.\n \n \nIt wasn\u2019t until an echo showed left ventricular hypertrophy that a doctor acknowledged it might not be anxiety. Much bloodwork found super elevated renin and aldosterone. Losartan stabilizes my chronically low potassium and helped the numbers a bit. \n \nOn top of the BP stuff, my left kidney hurt like a sonofabitch. I peed blood sometimes and it felt like a rusty fork was permanently lodged in my left flank. It ended up being renal nutcracker syndrome. Had surgery in October to transposition the vein and IT CURED ME. No more high blood pressure, normal heartrate, my foggy head cleared and I didn\u2019t need to sleep so much, no more pelvic and flank pain. It was pretty great.\n \n \nFor a month... And then the god damned vein scarred shut and everything came back worse. The general consensus was that the occluded left renal vein was causing low perfusion pressure, raising renin, raising aldosterone and angiotensin, causing the crazy BP swings. The blood that should have been going from the kidney to the IVC and up to the heart was refluxing down into the ovarian vein and pelvic plexus, causing low cardiac preload, tachycardia. Makes sense!\n\n \nSo we cut out my fucking kidney on Monday. I guess my body had created tons of weird little inefficient collateral veins so it was a thing but all went well and my numbers were decent in the hospital so I came home Tuesday.\n\n \nBut my blood pressure and heartrate have steadily climbed the last few days and I feel worse than ever. Just laying in bed, my numbers used to be low, like 100/60, HR 50s. But not they\u2019re like 150/110, HR 130. It won\u2019t go down. I\u2019m talking my meds, drinking plenty of water. Wtf is wrong???\n \n \nMy doctors don\u2019t know what to tell me. I\u2019m scared and angry and don\u2019t understand how I could possible get worse by cutting out the problem."

I did not assume anything of it at first because i was close to the start of ovulation and had felt a slight, quick cramp not 30 minutes earlier, so i just assumed it was \"mittelschmerz\". Over the last 9 days the bleeding got slowly heavier, and now i would consider its volume to be like a very light period's. The color of the blood ranges from red (fresh blood) to brown or black (old blood). It doesnt stink the usual was periods do, just smells like blood.\n\nMy last period was on 11th July, lasting 5 days with heavy discharge, as normal for me, the next one is predicted to start at August 13th up to August 30th. My cycles usually last from 31 to 52 days.\n\nI am in a monogamous relationship and my partner and i do not engage in penetrative sex (nor naked rubbing or etc). We havent had sex since 2 weeks before the bleeding started due to him being sick. we are both std free. I dont take pills or have an iud, my partner does not use a condom or related unless there is any chance of our genitals spending any time close to each other.\n\nI have (untreated) PCOS, which was kept in check by me controlling my weight, tracking cycles and symptoms. Over the past year i did get considerably fatter, but started losing roundabout 1 month ago (before the bleeding started).\n\nThis is the first time anything of the sort happened ever since i started having periods when i was 10. I dont have any other symptoms or mood changes accompanying the bleeding. I dont have my usual period symptoms (back pain, pms) either.\n\n.\n\nEDIT August 4th, late afternoon: just went to the bathroom. There was a visible spot in my pad (before this it wasnt enough to stain the pad). When i wiped a lot more blood came out, enough to be considered an average period's worth."

My doctor's office just uploads all test results to a patient portal and emails me. In the results, I saw my potassium was 3.2, when normal is 3.5-5.1. I don't think my doctor has seen the results yet. I'm freaking out that I'm dropping too low and going to start having arrhythmias. I've also thrown out my back I believe, and get painful spasms of my back. I know muscle spasms are a symptom of low potassium. Do you think that is related? Am I overreacting? I have a history of panic disorder and I also have crippling health anxiety so I feel like I'm dying. I've had some mild on and off loose stool for the last week or so, but I don't know if it's enough to lower my potassium. Will I be okay until I talk to my doctor tomorrow? Do you think they'll want to repeat bloodwork? I'm so scared this is going to kill me."

        "reddit": "**General Info:** 29 year old female / 112 lbs / no personal history of bipolar disorder\n\n**Previous Medical Information:** I've always had anxiety and panic attacks and tried fluoxetine twice in the past (once in my teens and once in my mid-twenties). Both times I didn't experience side effects but the medication didn't do much either. Otherwise, I'm healthy and the only other medication I take is Benadryl for seasonal allergies as needed.\n\n**Family History:** Family history of depression and anxiety. One aunt who I don't know well has bipolar disorder.\n\n**Recent Problem:** I'm a tenure track professor and researcher. My job is pretty stressful. At the end of this past semester I thought I was suffering from burnout but when it didn't go away I feared depression and went to a walk-in clinic. My symptoms were lack of appetite, feeling fatigued and exhausted all the time, crying spells, inability to concentrate on work or be productive, and feelings of numbness and hopelessness. It had lasted about a month. The doctor prescribed Celexa. I was told to start at 5mg for two weeks and then gradually increase to 20mg.\n\nThe first couple of days I felt really nauseated and tired. I took it in the morning with food. I also had insomnia but took Benadryl to counteract this. The fourth day, I felt euphoric. I felt happier than I had in a really long time. I wasn't anxious going to the grocery store and was actually able to communicate with people freely without anxiety. I started to feel good about myself and had increased energy. I also had a higher libido. It matched the libido I had before I started to feel depressed. I was really happy about it but started to suspect it wasn't normal to feel THIS good on day 5. I didn't take my Benadryl last night because I figured I'd be able to sleep well since I felt so good. However, I didn't feel tired. I felt refreshed and wide awake and like I wanted to get some work done. At 5AM I realized that this really wasn't normal and had my spouse drive me to the ER. The doctor spoke to me for about 5 minutes and said I was experiencing a hypomanic episode. She said this only happens on SSRI medications if there is underlying bipolar disorder. She unofficially diagnosed me as bipolar, told me to cease taking Celexa, and prescribed the following;\n\n* ***Seroquel (antipsychotic) starting at 50mg and daily increasing to 300mg per night.***\n\nFirst of all, this drug seems to have bad side effects. Second of all, the 50mg they gave me in the hospital has made it so that I can barely function today. I feel sedated and my brain feels all muddy. I definitely don't want to take 300mg of this as I'll probably be non-functional and lose my job. I didn't fill the prescription. I'm waiting until Monday (tomorrow) so I can see my general doctor and also go to the mental health services place here to see if I can get a psychiatry referral. I don't feel hypomanic today at all. I feel like my episode was relatively mild -- no impulsivity, no delusions or hallucinations and I was still able to sit still and concentrate on a movie.\n\n1. Is this a high dose of seroquel for someone of my weight who tends to be sensitive to medications?\n2. Is having a hypomanic episode on SSRI medication always 100% caused by underlying Bipolar disorder? I haven't had hypomanic or manic episodes before.\n3. Is it safe for me to just discontinue the Celexa since it was only 5mg and I only took it for 5 days? I'm scared of withdrawals.\n4. Is it safe for me to wait until I see my GP before starting antipsychotic medications?"

The pain I feel in my stomach and lower back only gets better with the maximum dose of ibuprofen. I recently went to an urgent care for the flu, and the Nurse Practitioner felt my lower pelvic area(where I assume my ovaries/uterus are) and I felt an immense amount of pain. She told me that I should see a OBGYN after I recovered from the flu.  \nHowever, my mom has always had very heavy periods and similar symptoms so therefore it's normal? The other women in our family also say that as well, and have never had any issues other than my mom. My mother has a history of uterine and ovarian cancer and developed anemia after her period wouldn't stop even after being put on birth control and had to have an emergency hysterectomy. She is diagnosed with Endemetriosis and tells me it is not hereditary (my grandma did not have any that).  \nAm I simply overreacting over my periods or is something else wrong? I don't want to go to a doctor if it is just a heavy period.

I do not smoke and currently, take pantomed 20mg 1x per day for the gastritis.\n\n  \nI need medical advice for three things: I rather put them all in one post instead of three different ones think that would be better but correct me if I am wrong.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  \n1. The most recent one) I had a sharp testicular pain on the left side today while walking. I lasted only very short but stopped me from walking. Touching my balls did not hurt and there seems to be no swelling just a bit of paleness of the scrotum, as well as the softness of left testis. It feels softer than the other one. I doubt that it is a testicular torsion as from all the stories I heard and read it hurts like hell and stays, rather than simply come and go. The second time the pain came was about two hours later and while seated. Last time it happened I went to the urologists but they did not see anything at all. Also nothing from urinary tests. I still have scintigraphy to do on Monday before seeing them again.    \n\n\nFind attached here below pictures which I tried to take as well as I can, but it is hard since I do not have a big mirror or anything.

Been to a cardiologist and my heart is completely fine eve under stress. The pain can be left or right side but always with shortness of breath and stabbing pain. I have been hospitalized not long ago and they found out that I have light gastritis and hatial hernia with reflux at the esophagus level by the gastroscopy.    \nMy thought was that the chest pain and shortness of breath can be due to the hernia, but two different GPS already told me that it is so small that it is insignificant and cannot be from there as the hospital did not even write the size of the hernia in the letter to him. What else can it be then?  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  \n3) Due to the different symptoms (e.g I had trouble swallowing before) I have done a lot of different CT\u00b4s and scanners lately.

However, my vistril says the same thing and my doctor told me a glass of wine isn\u2019t going to hurt me. So is this the same story? Or should I just wait and start tomorrow night? The other thing I noticed is that it can mess with the efficiency of birth control, which thank goodness I actually read the info because I usually just throw it aside. My doctor didn\u2019t mention anything about either one of these things so I\u2019m not sure if they are side effects that don\u2019t pertain to me or if I should be taking extra precautions.

They also told me that I needed to schedule another appointment for another blood test, to ensure that there wasn\u2019t a mistake.\n\nTwo months or so before this I visited an urgent care with some vaginal discomfort (I thought it was a yeast infection) where they told me that my urine test indicated that I had a UTI and might be pregnant (even when I had already had three periods since the last time I had unprotected sex with my bf). They wanted me to do a blood test that day to confirm the pregnancy result, but I was in a rush and refused. They treated me for the UTI and needless to say, I ended up not being pregnant.\n\nA week after this visit, they called me back and told me that I had Chlamydia. They quickly treated me for this. I told my boyfriend, he went to get tested for STDs, and also ended up having Chlamydia (but nothing else)\n\nI am hoping that my low white blood cell count is a product of having Chlamydia that I didn\u2019t know about. But, honestly, this whole situation is just stressing me out. Why do I need to take another blood test? Why can\u2019t you just tell me what\u2019s wrong with my body from one appointment? All these \u201cyou COULD be\u201d \u201cyou MIGHT have\u201d. Why don\u2019t you know? This is your job.\n\nNow, I\u2019m really just anxious. Every time I get a call from the doctor\u2019s I panic. All they\u2019ve had for me these last few months is bad news and uncertainties. It\u2019s frustrating. Lately, my body has been feeling off, and I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s because of the stress/ anxiety that the doctor\u2019s keep piling onto me, or if something truly is wrong with me &amp; they can\u2019t figure it out. \n\nI\u2019ll list out some of the symptoms I still have even after treatment for Chlamydia + UTI:\n\nAbdominal pain (sometimes sharp)\nExtreme fatigue\nDiarrhea \nHacking up phlegm (with no cough)\nAnxiety\nPoor appetite (I\u2019ve never eaten that much in general)\nSlight discomfort when I urinate (like I don\u2019t get all of it out)\nGet cold easily\nVaginal discharge (smelly)\n\nIf you have any answers for me I\u2019d really appreciate it."

I have  anxiety and intrusive thoughts, so i agreed to be put on it to see if it  helped. I noticed some side effects right away such as having a less  refreshing sleep. That was on 1mg dose. I have since gotten 2 mg and 3 mg respectively, and i could feel my sleep quality getting worse as my  dose rose. I've had trouble sleeping for weeks but the last week it's significantly worsened, and just as i rose from 2 mg to 3, too. I can't sleep at all now, it's like i've lost the ability to fall asleep completely. I'm so tired and feel like i'm about to pass out but yet when i lie down i can't fall asleep.\n\nThe  problem is the clinician who assigned me this dose isn't communicating  with me. I have complained about the sleep thing on several occations  but it's as if i get brushed off and treated as someone who is just  paranoid or imagining things They simply said that that was not a  common side effect of the drug, even though it says so on the  description for the medication. I could deal with less restorative  sleep, but right now i'm not sleeping at all.  I am really worried about  how long i can go on like this and i don't know who to go to or how to communicate my problem. I guess i am very afraid"

A few days later I got hit from behind in the same eye (he threw a hook that connected to the side near my temple/eye area).\n\nI noticed on my camera roll before the fight, id always take selfies from the left side, and i often didnt even bother with wearing my glasses.\n\nThen I noticed that i took a pic of my eye right after it happened and i took it from the right, and starting favoring the right side. I also started wearing my glasses.\n\nFrom straight ahead before. my eyes both looked evenly. Now my right eye veers off and away slightly. I feel like i cant look left without turning my head.\n\nAlso, my left eye seems \"dead\". Like its just not really focused on the camera.\n\nI could be imagining all of this, but I still have loss of vision on the inner half of my left eye, and in photos it now looks like im making up for that by constantly turning my head slighty left while gazing slightly right.\n\nIs this possible?

No doctor former or present had been able to see anything sketchy during fast blood tests.In May 2014 I weighed 263. I was having problems with what I assume is blood sugar.  Cold sweats, inability to focus, feeling like my head was moving when it wasn\u2019t and the only thing that solved it was food.  In September of 2014 I had dropped to 187.  I had began working out every day for upwards of an hour and eating food besides pizza.  I still get these cold sweats and dizziness/lightheaded now that I\u2019m in better shape.  I\u2019ve been tested for diabetes two times since then and everything was okay.  I\u2019m unsure how to proceed however I know somethings wrong and I\u2019m scared now that I\u2019ll get dizzy unexpectedly and won\u2019t be able to care for my infant daughter.  This appears to be common for diabetes, but I\u2019m unsure of how to proceed.\n\nEmotional:\nI had a job that required overnights that I wasn\u2019t aware of.  It was a month solid of 2-4 hours of sleep per night and living off caffeine.  During this time I developed an inability to stop crying in normal situations.\n\nI cried during a job interview when I told them I was grateful for the opportunity to talk to him.\n\nI cried when I told my partner I loved her or hugged her.\n\nThat was four years ago.  I still cry over stuff that I don\u2019t really care that much about and I don\u2019t feel sad.\n\nI haven\u2019t really known where to look into this or how.  I don\u2019t believe therapy is the issue because there\u2019s nothing I feel that\u2019s emotionally wrong and I\u2019m pretty open about if something is messed up.\n\nThis led me to question if it was a hormone issue?  Testosterone maybe?  The emotional stuff coupled with the additional sexual stuff below has really made me wonder what\u2019s occurring.  I could handle the crying because I knew there wasn\u2019t anything wrong, however...\n\n\nNot to toot my own horn but from 2015-2017 I was pretty good in bed...  there was a reduction in sex towards the end of 2017 due to my partner having a more stressful job.  A lack of \u201cpractice\u201dmay be a contributing factor to premature.\n\nI\u2019ve been recently (6 months) been having some issues in the sexual department.  I am able to get an erection however it doesn\u2019t go fully hard. Maybe 85% of the way.  With this inability to get fully hard there is an extreme increase in sensitivity in the head of my penis to the point where I can finish in sub 30 seconds of just being touched.  \n\nI\u2019m unsure where I could proceed medically.  I still exercise frequently (2-3 times a week, down from 6-7 a week tho).  I still find the woman I\u2019m with to be unbelievably attractive and still have the desire and lust for her like I did on day 1.\n\nIs there anything I could mention to my doctor to get a ball rolling?  I\u2019m currently looking for a new GP as I just relocated...  My concern is that I have low T or some other hormone but Google only me so much to work off of."

I was also prescribed 5mg of Lexapro. My health is a major contributor to anxiety for me. Lately it\u2019s been my heart that\u2019s been my biggest worry. Despite the fact that about a month and a half ago my doctor told me my heart was in good shape and I had great blood pressure, I\u2019m still worried. Part of this worry comes from the fact that in rare cases, Lexapro can apparently cause irregular heart rhythms. Sometimes when I get anxious, I\u2019ll get chest pains that are generally localized in certain areas. I know this is probably anxiety, but it\u2019s still scares the hell out of me and makes me more anxious in turn. I also noticed that my resting heart rate is 53-63, which I know is slightly below the threshold of normal for athletes. Is all this normal?"

Well, this summer it feels like I have lost all of my friends. Nothing interests me to much anymore, I used to love the outdoors. I am always feeling tired/fatigued, very low motivation, nervousness/anxiety, have always had diarrhea regularly for the past 3-4 years (not sure if thats needed) and a great feeling of brain fog, almost numb and forgetful. Especially when speaking to people, almost as if I'm in third person and it takes me a good few seconds to register what people say. I'm only a junior and its crazy, its like I'm losing all hope and do not feel comfortable at all talking to people, I talk to my parents but I don't even hug them anymore. The thing is, I went into my doctor and talked about these problems, we did immediate bloodwork and it looked like my kidneys were a bit damaged, (not super important) by higher amounts of chemicals, I forgot the name. But my blood sugar was at 59, before I went to the doctor (1-1/2 hours) I had two peanut butter sandwiches and a glass of orange juice. Any idea why my blood sugar was so low? The part that makes me hopeless is I purchased a tester kit and tested it 4 days after the doc appointment and it read around 93, and around 113 after I ate food. I'm stumped, I still feel horrible and I lost my lead that gave me hope. Anything, I mean any ideas would be amazing, I just feel like this is a physical problem, not a mental problem, maybe its just giving me symptoms of depression."

Over the next 10ish months, I noticed that if I squinted, I could see small lines in my vision. I thought nothing of it at first, but it kept getting worse and worse until now, where I can see that they seem to be veins and random groups of straight lines by barely squinting. I went to a different eye doctor so that I could have an appointment dedicated to figuring this out. At the end of the appointment, he basically said something along the lines of \"sometimes your brain just plays tricks\", which I immediately thought wasn't my problem, because it just sounded ridiculous.

        "reddit": "I'm recently 30, I'm female, and I've been fighting with my Dr's office to get proper care for over 5 years. \n\nI had to switch GP's due to a change in insurance \\~6 years ago.  My previous Dr. was an older gentleman who has a family practice, He always listened to my concerns, Answered my questions himself, and would suggest multiple appropriate solutions to my problems (taking into account my preferences) for which one he said we should try first. \n\n**My \"new\" Dr. will not listen to me!** \n\nWhen I went to my \"old\" GP asking for BC to skip periods (because they were heavy and painful) and control severe acne he put me on a Seasonale equivalent, I was on the same medication/dose from age 18 to 25, with no breaks and no negative side effects. I had just been to my yearly pap and had gotten a new script about 3 weeks before my insurance changed, The insurance company did not tell me that any old prescriptions would need to be renewed through a new Dr in their network in order for them to cover it (I had switched insurance before but had been able to keep my Dr.) until I went to pick up my next pack and the pharmacy told me insurance had denied it for being an old script. \n\nSo I made an appointment to visit this Dr., I explained that my BC script had \"expired\" the insurance would not pay for it because it was old and I needed a new one, I brought the packaging of the old medication with me so that she could write me the script for the same kind.   She said I didn't need to be taking that brand/kind/type because it was used to skip periods (Seasonale equivalent) and when I said \"That's what I use it for, skipping periods and preventing acne. I'm not using it to prevent pregnancy.\"  she looked me straight in the eye and said, \"well then why are you taking it?\" WTF? I literally just said I'm taking it to skip periods???  So I said \"I use it to skip my periods and prevent acne.\" she shook her head and stared at me for a minute and then just said \"No.\" and that was only the first time I was refused care for something.  \n\nShe has suggested multiple times that my chronic back pain/issues I have had since I was 11 years old are because I am overweight when I was never overweight until after she refused to write a new script for the BC and I was forced to stop taking it. \n\nI went back 2 or 3 months later saying that my periods are now excessively heavy and excruciatingly painful (I often have to call into work because I can't get out of bed) and she still refused to write me the script. I have gone back at least 8 times in 5 years and I've been refused the medication every single time.  I even told her that the amount of stuff (tampons, pads, pain killers, new clothes when the old ones get ruined, etc.) I have to buy to control/prepare for/deal with my period is putting a burden on my finances and she actually suggested I look for a different job? Am I wrong or is that completely unprofessional? \n\nI've tried to switch Dr's but my insurance only works with a few offices in my area (they are somehow all operated by this same Dr?) and absolutely NO gynecologists in my area accept the insurance I have.  The office itself won't let me switch Dr's even after I have asked multiple times; expressing my concerns to them that I am not getting the care that I need, and that I'm not satisfied with the services that this Dr. is providing.  I've also done some research (recently and accidentally) and this Dr. is accepting huge amounts of money from drug companies that mostly deal with diabetes medications.\n\nI'm so frustrated, I don't know what to do. My mental health is suffering; my depression has gotten worse (I want to die now), I've become more anxious (I started biting my nails/the skin around them and I have tried to stop but I can't), and every time I mention this to my Dr she just dismisses my concerns and problems. \n\n**TLDR: My \"New\" Dr. refused to give me a script for birth control because I use it to skip periods instead of preventing pregnancy and now I want to die.**"

I can remove all spicy food and caffeine and chocolate from my diet, sleep only on the left side, with an elevated headrest and... Get nothing. And I already exercise daily, stay hydrated...\n\nAnd flipping that around, I've had days where I eat plenty of spicy food/drink plenty of coffee, and it doesn't seem to have any effect at all. So, it's really made it hard to have confidence in my medical professionals - and I can't afford to keep being seen to have people go 'uh-huh, well, we just don't know.'\n\nAt the moment, I dread sleeping and I dread waking. Lately, my mouth feels like it's locking up; it's constantly dry and 'sucking' inwards, and nobody (dentist/oral medical specialist) can seem to figure out why. Like every other condition, it doesn't seem to be dangerous, but - I'm just constantly miserable. Haha.\n\nPlease help.\n\nedited and thank you, so much!"

Medications: Diane 35. \n\nHey guys, \n\nSo I\u2019ve had some symptoms for about six months plus, and they are progressively getting worse. Extreme fatigue, to the point where I can\u2019t even get to class/can\u2019t stay awake when I do (yes, literally falling dead asleep in classrooms). I have periods of low grade fevers, mainly in the early hours of the morning/waking. These periods come and go (eg might have them for a month, then not, then again). I\u2019ve had an enlarged spleen (confirmed by a GP) which is also painful at times. I\u2019ve had a loss of appetite and often only have one meal a day, and often don\u2019t want food at all. As a consequence, I have lost some size but not a heap. Recently I\u2019ve had a mild barking cough every now and then for no discernible reason, and a tight chest. \n\nThen, three weeks ago, I found a lump on my neck. It came up literally over night. One day I didn\u2019t have it, the next I did. It\u2019s off the midline of my neck, to the left, in the \u2018anterior triangle\u2019. It\u2019s quite big (close to golf ball size, maybe ping pong ball or bigger). It feels completely solid, as solid as one of those rubber balls you play with as a kid, the hard ones. I can\u2019t move it around with my fingers. It doesn\u2019t move per say when I swallow or stick my tongue out, like, the lump is still in the same place, but it moves in the sense that it\u2019s attracted to its surroundings and its surroundings move (if that makes sense). It doesn\u2019t hurt, not tender. \n\nAnyway, I got an ultrasound today. The technician looked quite grave and said she wanted to show the doctor the images and see if he wanted to look himself. He did. He had a look and asked her \u2018is there any vascularity\u2019 and she said \u2018there\u2019s some just here\u2019 and pointed to the outside edge of the lump. It was big, like very obvious on the ultrasound, circle, black. \n\nThe radiologist told me I\u2019d likely be referred to an ENT and have a CT, surgery may be an option depending. He said it could be a cyst. \n\nNow, obviously there\u2019s more tests to be done. But I feel like my GP (and I suppose the radiologist, although he didn\u2019t ask me about symptoms and didn\u2019t have any information on my referral other than to scan the neck) aren\u2019t understanding that my symptoms OTHER than the lump are truly concerning me. The lump is getting bigger but it isn\u2019t impacting my life - I\u2019m so tired I literally can\u2019t quite function. \n\nI don\u2019t know whether the lump and symptoms are actually connected, but I want a solution. \n\nAlso how common is it for someone to suddenly have a Thyroglossal cyst issue, golf ball sized, over night and in their mid twenties? I\u2019ve never had a lump in my neck before. I also hadn\u2019t had a cold or flu except three months prior I had a week long cold. \n\nAny suggestions as to what could be going on and how much to push for a solution?"

And I was fine for a few days, until tonight when I went to sleep and laid down, flat on my back I immediately felt both testicles tighten, so I quickly stood up and inspected and it seemed like the cremaster muscle went haywire because my scrotum seemed completely flat, so i started panicking and placed my hand over it to give it some warmth and slowly they came back down and took their usual spots. When I attempted to lay down again I felt the exact same thing and this time it seemed like both of my testicles were stuck, bunched up in front, with the cremaster muscle kicking in. *There is no pain*, but I am worried that it means that some sort of blood flow is getting cut off if they go back down but aren't all the way in the scrotum.  Even though its very warm, the muscle is still taking effect. Is it something to do with the legs? Is laying down somehow activating a movement in my scrotum, which eventually leads to the cremaster coming into play?\n\nIs it possible to have an extreme case of Bell Clapper develop later in life? Does torsion always involve pain? I'm afraid to even attempt to move them down because they just don't feel normal, and because I don't want to mess anything up if anything is even wrong with them. Is there a method or are there any methods to correct this surgically?\n\nI am just shaky and nervous and scared because I have never experienced anything like this. Is it purely psychological or could there be something very wrong with me? As far as I know I haven't injured my testicles in any way. So I'm not sure if the reason why they are so elastic and then quickly tighten would be due to low testosterone production in my body. Sorry about all the questions, it's just that its 5:55am and I really don't know what to do or if there is anything anyone can do and I have gotten no sleep because of this, what am I supposed to do, stand up and sleep?  \n\n\nNote that this has never been an issue before, I've been able to go to sleep without having to solely sleep flat on my back to prevent any possible torsion, but lately its all I have done because I wouldn't want to turn over in bed and end up with something like torsion.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTIA to those who reply!"

I went to the doc, they gave me a steroid. Since then it hasnt left. I have been seeing an asthma doc/allergist since july.

She did a chest xray which she said has nothing super emergent but did say I has some nodules which is freaking me out. She seems to think that the nodules are not cancer and rather connected to my asthma and the last two months of crap. She did not seem concerned but I am a worrier. She is having me follow up with a chest CT and said given all that I have been dealing with I should see a pulmonologist, which I will do. But I am freaking out. What are the odds these nodules are connected to my asthma and not something very very serious?

I have previously been to an ENT about this, who did not find anything unusual - although he did comment that my throat muscles looked tightened, but I believe this may have just been because I was tensing up due to being anxious about the examination.\n\nI guess my first concern is to rule out the possibility of it being heart related, although I already doubt this option since the symptoms are nearly constant regardless of physical activity.

Thank you for any advice or insights. :)\n\nAlmost three years ago my terrible nail picking habit damaged my thumb nail bad enough that I had a massive growth of proud flesh under the nail on my left thumb. Doctors didn't know what to do, and finally they just removed the entire nail - badly, damaging the nail matrix bad enough that the nail never grew back, aside from a layer of flaky hard skin that continuously cracked. The tissue (protruding about 0.8 cm from my nail bed) regenerated fast enough to heal these wounds in a matter of hours. I had constant infections under the cuticle. Despite using steroid ointments (STRONG ones), and finally a period of silver nitrate bandages, the flesh grew back bigger than before, covering most of the nail bed.\n\nFinally, a surgeon removed the last of the nail matrix and nail bed with phenol a couple of days ago. He was reluctant to do it, but having explained that I've been turned away from several doctors (podiatrists, dermatologists and my GP included) he agreed to do it - despite being an orthopaedic surgeon. I know I will never get my nail back, but after 2,5 years of constant pain and infections I'm mostly relieved. \n\nGoogle isn't helpful (all I can find are images of partial nail avulsions and texts saying \"it'll grow back\"), and I can't figure out what the chances are that the lump of flesh will grow back. This is my biggest concern, because it regenerated at such an insane speed whenever I had a cut or crack. First time it was removed, it had grown back by the time I got home from urgent care. Most doctors I've seen have told me to call them if I ever figure it out, or tried to remove the flesh without numbing me up, assuming there's a pocket of puss under the skin.\n\nDoes anyone have any experience with this? Does anyone know what my thumb will end up looking like, or what consequences not having a thumb nail could have? I'm massively grateful for any insight anyone could have, because all I can find is information about ingrown toenails and horses, for whatever reason.\n\n[Pictures before first nail removal, a month after, and then after complete removal two days ago.](https://imgur.com/a/CZCWPRU) Apologies for the snapchat captions, these are the best photos I have.\n\nThank you for any insight into this.

        "reddit": "**Details:** 29 year old female / 110 lbs / 5'3\n\n**The Problem:**\n\nI've always been petite and I guess I took it for granted and just assumed I could eat whatever I wanted. I've always loved vegetables so I've always eaten a lot of them but I also ate a lot of junk (fries, pizza, nuggets, chips, etc.). Then, this past summer I suffered a major depressive episode. I have panic disorder but this was my first depressive episode. I alternated between not having the energy or desire to eat much of anything to only eating junk. I didn't gain weight but I felt like crap. I ended up going to the hospital because of the depression. My doctor put me on Celexa for my panic and depression. She also ran a blood panel and my bad cholesterol came back high (good cholesterol is at a nice level). My iron was low and so was my magnesium. I had slightly elevated calcium. All of this really scared me.   \n\n\n  \n**The Changes:**  \n\n\nThe Celexa has made a huge difference. I take it on schedule and the world seems a bit \"brighter\". I'm less afraid to talk to people now and my motivation regarding my work has increased. I have more energy. My doctor also prescribed iron supplements and magnesium supplements (prescription strength) which I've been taking as prescribed.  \n\n\nI cut down my alcohol intake. Before, I was drinking 2-3 glasses of wine almost every night because it would calm my anxiety. I cut down to one small glass every few days. I cut coffee down to one cup (black) versus the 4-5 cups (black) I was drinking every morning in the past.   \n\n\nI started going to bed earlier. Before the depression set in, I was sort of a workaholic and wouldn't go to bed until 2:00am most nights. Now, I'm usually in bed around 12:30 and I take at least an hour to relax before bed. \n\nI made big dietary changes. I now only eat red meat once a month. I mostly eat beans and legumes, plenty of vegetables, nuts, fatty fish and olive oil, occasional poultry (maybe once a week), and healthy grains (quinoa, oats, barley, etc.). I feel awesome. I don't eat many fruits but that's because I've never been much into sweets. For fruits I eat a handful of berries here and there or I add a banana to my unsweetened oats in the morning. I drink a lot more water, too. My doctor told me not to cut out all junk because it isn't sustainable long-term for most people. Every two weeks I allow myself a \"cheat\" night where I indulge in ONE thing I really like. Last time it was a small poutine. This time it's going to be samosas.   \n\n\nI've increased my activity. I'm not going to the gym all the time but I walk about 20-35 minutes almost every day and I go swimming once a week. I have a really demanding career so it's hard to get exercise time in. I hope to increase it in the future.   \n\n\n**Questions:**   \n\n\n1. I've had well-meaning friends say I'm not doing the right thing in terms of diet and that in order to lower cholesterol I need to consume less carbs. One friend said I should cut out the beans/legumes and healthy grains and concentrate on proteins and fats. She follows keto. Is the diet I described above ok or is there something I can do better? I'm not trying to lose weight, I just want to be healthy. In fact, I really don't want to lose ANY weight.\n2. How else can I increase my activity in a way that won't take up too much time every day? I'm assuming my small change in activity (the walking and swimming) won't do much health-wise even though it's making me feel better.\n3. A family member told me to stop my Celexa and look to herbs like St. John's Wort instead. She said that antidepressants cause addiction, change your personality, and over time can ruin creativity and cognitive functioning. This kind of sounds like bull to me but is there any truth to these claims? I'm doing really well on the medication. I'm finally not in a constant state of panic or depression."

Suspected MCAS (pending tryptase test to be done during next flare). Had a vestibulectomy in January to treat vestibular adenitis, and then had it repeated in June when the first one was unsuccessful. Had an issue with excessive bleeding after the second surgery and had to return to the hospital for extra stitches. Currently 9 weeks post-op and doing well. Suspected craniocervical instability and Chiari malformation, pending MRIs that have been ordered. Suspected central sleep apnea, pending sleep study that has been ordered.\n\nAfter my first surgery, I had a really bad autoimmune flare, which my doctor believes was due to MCAS. It was controlled with antihistamines and steroids. After my second surgery, I did not have an autoimmune flare, but I had a bad reaction with my heart. I had always gotten winded easily (even as a kid, I couldn't run around like the other kids my age without my heart racing out of my chest), but after my surgery, it got so bad that I had to sit on the floor to brush my teeth. After my echo showed MVP, I was diagnosed with hEDS by diagnostic criteria. I have not undergone genetic testing yet, but I will eventually.\n\nThe metoprolol helps immensely, but there are a couple of things it hasn't helped. First, my hands shake like crazy. You'd think I were really nervous or something, but it's just that my hands aren't steady. They don't feel weak, they just shake. It's not all the time. It comes and goes. But it's very annoying.\n\nSecond (and this is the main reason for my post), my pulse hurts sometimes. I get a pain in areas where I have major veins. Most commonly in my neck (carotid artery), but also once in my wrist, and today I got it in the top of my thigh. It usually lasts for about 5-10 seconds. I massage the area while it's happening because it feels like it needs it, and it usually goes away after a bit. It happens...maybe on average once a day? I don't think this happened before my second surgery, but I might just not have thought about it as much since my recent diagnoses.\n\nMy fear is that this could be indicative of a vascular component with my EDS. Clearly there is some vascular involvement, but it has been limited so far. My echo did not show aortic root dilation or any other issues apart from MVP. That being said, my first cardiologist was awful. He said my echo and ekg were both perfectly fine. I had to ask him three times to double check the results before he saw the MVP. And the ekg tech clearly reported arrhythmias on my ekg, which the doctor didn't even acknowledge. So I'm not confident something else wasn't missed on the echo, and I plan to ask my new cardiologist to take a look. He's a genetic cardiologist and should have an eye for what to look out for the most.\n\nIf anyone can provide any insight into what might be causing the pain and whether or not I should be worried, I would greatly appreciate it.\n\nThanks so much!"

So 5 days ago I noticed my bellybutton was having some issues. It was \"crusty\" inside and painful. It felt like a sunburn, but my bellybutton has not been exposed to any sun. On day 3, I noticed it was more red and there was a ring of brown \"crust\" around my belly button. I washed it off and it didn't come back. But, since I first noticed symptoms, a firm, white lump has begun to form inside my bellybutton. The surrounding area is red, but the lump itself is pure white. It is still mildly painful, but when it comes in contact with clothing (especially when I bend down and my Jean's press into it) it becomes very painful, almost like touching an open wound. There has been a little bit of clear discharge that doesn't have a smell, but the lump itself doesn't seem to be leaking or draining. I have been applying Neosporin, but it doesn't seem to be improving. It's actually getting worse if anything. Over the past week I've been having some stomach issues (gas, nausea, diarrhea, etc.) as well as a lot of fatigue no matter how much or little I sleep, but I have been attributing that to increasing the dosage of my antidepressant, as these are the symptoms I usually get when my dose is increased. \n\nShould I go to a doctor, or is this not a big deal?

Got an X-ray and everything was ok so I was sent to an MRI today.\n\nI dont know when I'll be getting the call with the results because of labor day weekend so I'm hoping one of you can give some insight.\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/GxxhF25](https://imgur.com/a/GxxhF25)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-thanks"

I could never focus on studying and would try to read my textbooks, but I would last maybe five minutes and end up drawing in my notebook or even start staring at my wall. I've always been very absent minded and would break things or mess things up, because I wanted pay attention to what anyone was telling me. My parents would just label me to be a \"goof ball\". So, growing up I'm just like \"hey, everything is boring and complicated! I'm just a goof ball. No big deal\". \n\nIn college I got a little better, but man it is a struggle. If I didn't study I would fail my classes (because I can never focus in class) so I have to like force myself to read my notes or textbooks. It's almost like something is physically pulling my brain away from the pages. Meanwhile, I'm almost building up this anxiety inside of my body because I'm not moving around and doing a bunch of random shit. Currently, I should be writing something for a class but instead I'm writing this and it's mostly because I can't stay motivated/focused. I can't even focus on someone talking to me one on one. Someone can tell me a whole sentence about them and I will zone out and think about something else. This really sucks, because people would think I don't like them, but really I'm just not present. It happens socially, with my professors, and even job interviews. It's not really because I'm not interested, but because my attention just can't stick to one thing. I also tap my foot a lot, crack my knuckles, and shuffle around in a chair and the weird thing is when I do these things I'm thinking about that rather than my professor who's five feet in front of me. \n\nI'm just a little scared to start medication as people in my life are very reliant on medication and it has always bothered me. The reason I never got evaluated was that my parents told me they don't want me to be like them, so mental illness or disabilities never truly existed in my family. SO, naturally I'm a bit nervous about talking to anyone about this. But, damn after writing this out I think I should speak to a doctor. \n\nSo, does this sound like ADHD or is there something else going on?"

I've gotten 3 in the past 3 or 4 months, but I remember getting some when I first started going through puberty, when I was 13 or 14.\n\nThey kind of seem like big, painful pimples. The area above and below them kind of gets hard, and once they \"pop\", if I press on the hard area, this gooey stuff comes out. It's pretty thick. It doesn't soak into toilet paper really, just kind of sits there.  It's kinda yellowish-whitish-greenish, and opaque. That's what two out of the three I remember have been like.\n\nThe other one is the one that I'm kind of worried about. It kind of had that weird ooze, plus quite a bit of blood. Not a concerning amount, just more than the others. It kind of grew skin and a lump. I don't know how to describe it. Kind of feels like a canker sore, but not in my mouth. The skin on it feels quite thin, but I don't want to touch it because it really hurts. And it's still bleeding, although not much. I don't really want to include a picture because I can't get a pic of it without getting my vagina and I'm not comfortable posting that, so I'm sorry. I hope I described it well.\n\nBy the way, I'm not sexually active and I never have been. I'm not sure if that's relevant but I figured I'd include it.\n\nAlso, my period ended Thursday.

So i recently have done a tilt test that my professor referred me to. Currently, i suffer from an unknown heart and bp weird functionality(sorry im NAD so idk medical terms all medical terms im using are written in my tilt test report) and the doc that was there diagnosed me with vasovagal syncope. Which i think is a strange diagnosis but not surprising considering he had no prior knowledge of my medical history.\n\n\nSo basically what happened was as soon as the nurse put me in an upright position my feet turned blue and both my heart rate and bp spiked. HR on 140 bp on 153.. After 2 mins both of those stats dropped and stabilized to 120 bp and 60 hr. After 15 mins of being upright, my blood pressure had a sudden drop to 75 and kept dropping as well as my heart rate dropping to 54 bpm and kept dropping. I felt sick before those sudden changes and my vision went blurry. The nurse had to stop the test at that point. When lowering the bed again my heart had a sudden spike to 100bpm and blood pressure again to 150. \n\n\n(Important notice ) i have been on beta-blockers for the past year now bisoprolol to be exact. And have been on them while doing the tilt test as well.\n\n\nIs this vaso vago? To me it made no since to be that after reading what vasso is since A. I wasn't stressed (sad to say this but im used to hospitals and tests by now) \n\nB. It usually happens when im standing up / sitting down. I gotta lay down for majority of my day and even then it can happen randomly \n\n\nThe chart of my test will be posted in a comment below it'll be an imgur link."

But something has been bothering me since the surgery.\n\nSome of my rib cartilage would be needed to extend the nose, ergo, I knew I wouldn't be able to wear a bra during the surgery. When I was walking down to be operated on, the nurse even ensured I wasn't wearing my bra under my hospital gown, on top of any jewelry. I assumed I was allowed to wear my underwear since my nose isn't anywhere near my nethers. The IV was inserted as per usual, and I don't recall anything else being done.\n\nSo I wake up, a little bit fuzzy, and the first thing I notice is that there's a tube up my vagina, so at first, I'm confused, wondering why there's a tube up my vagina, but then the secondary thought is that my underwear was removed. I am wheeled to the recovery room and the nurse casually removes the tube and hands me my underwear in a plastic baggie.\n\nDuring the whole healing process, I wondered what a tube up the vagina could be used for. I wasn't on my period, so it wasn't used to prevent blood leaking, it isn't an IV that gives anesthesia or fluids, or pain killers. I raked my brain and couldn't figure out. I was also upset because no one mentioned that my underwear would be removed, especially, not by me, but while I was under, and it wasn't implicit such as removing my bra so they could cut my rib cartilage, or let's say, a patient with a hernia knowing to remove their underwear for the surgery. I was too awkward to ask what the tube was for.\n\nWhen I got access to internet, I searched up what the tube was for, not really know what I was looking for but keywords were \"Tube, vagina, and rhinoplasty\", I mostly got results for labiaplasty and vaginal reconstruction but couldn't find a results for a tube up the vagina in the case of a Rhinoplasty, or anything besides vaginal reconstruction, actually. Am I being paranoid? Or is there a reason for tubes up the vagina? If it means anything, I was in Korea because of their expertise in Asian faces, and I'm 18.\n\nNot sure if I'm in the right thread but I figured doctors or surgeons would know what the various tubes used during surgery are used for.And not really relevant to the question, more to the thread, but I'm 18, East Asian, 5'5 and anywhere from 110 pounds to 115.\n\nEdit: Surgery lasted no more than 4 hours, a catheter is being suggested but it was in my vagina, not urethra, so I'm not sure. The forums online are saying that catheters are not usually used for rhinoplasty, so now I'm even more confused."

I am so sick of vomiting. I am so sick of horrible cramps and abdominal pain.\n\nI was told by two gynecologist that there was nothing else, and that I just needed to take my birth control.\n\nI was told by one gynecologist that he was unsure and that this 'shouldn't be happening' after surgery because it should have 'got it all' (????? - But isn't endometriosis always growing? Doesn't it grow in the presence of estrogen?)\n\nThe most recent gynecologist put me on a estrogen-progesterone combined pill and demanded that I take it even though I begged him to reconsider. He held my treatment hostage and demanded that I take it so I did. I lost three weeks of my life to that pill. I vomited uncontrollably for days. My abdomen never stopped bubbling.\n\nNow this same gynecologist wants to put me on nexplanon. I am... Hesitant. I feel at this point like most of the gynecologists who have seen me don't actually have the faintest idea what's wrong and are just throwing out whatever suggestion they think will work for the most women that show my symptoms.\n\nI'm just exhausted, and it's 3 a.m. and I'm trying not to puke, and I can't even masturbate these days because the cramps are so severe and the nausea so powerful afterwards.\n\nAnd I just... I just want to know, you know? Will the HPV really clear on its own? Am I really out of options when it comes to the severe pain and loss of function I am living with?\n\nI just...

Second incident happened at a water park)\n\n- can\u2019t stand for long periods of time (dizzy, lightheaded, but not new)\n\n- pain with cold feet (unbearably so, the pain crawls up to my knees &amp; makes walking difficult)\n\n- migraines\n\n- no appetite, felt nauseous if I tried to eat an average-sized meal\n\n- joint pain when overheated (mainly legs, sometimes a strong ache, other times as if my knees were replaced with sandpaper, a gritty, tv-static pain)\n\n- limb stiffness in the mornings\n\n- pain in my lower right rib cage, a breath-taking, stabbing pain that last for about 10-30 seconds each time it happens.\n\n- white splotches appearing on my legs when I overwork myself, or stand for too long.\n\n-managed to get mono twice. (first time, was extremely fatigued, swollen spleen, the whole shebang. The second time, not so much fatigue, but left with a blistered throat and a swollen spleen.)\n\nMy other panels came out clear (regarding anything autoimmune) and I tested negative for inflammation.\n\nMy next blood tests are four tests regarding my liver, three tests regarding my thyroid, one regarding vitamin D, and one retest for inflammation.\n\nI\u2019ve been prescribed:\n-Meloxicam\n\n-Potassium Vitamins (rejected, going for over-the-counter &amp; diet adjustments)\n\n-B12 injections (rejected, going for vitamins &amp; diet adjustments)\n\nAnd other medications disregarding the situation. \n\nBasically, I don\u2019t have a strong understanding of what\u2019s going on, or even if these symptoms just happen to everyone, and I\u2019m being over dramatic.

        "reddit": "Some info about myself. \nI am female and 16 years old. I\u2019m 170cm tall. I weigh abt 73kg. I dont smoke.\nI suffer from depression and due to that also from sleep-issues. I struggle to fall asleep and when I sleep its not very regenerating. To help me with that my psychiatrist told me to take a med called Trittico which works with trazodone. I should take 25mg every night before I go to sleep. I wanted to try it tonight so I read the instructions in the box and came across a couple of things that made me a bit worried. First of all, I am under 18 and the instructions state that you should not take it if you\u2019re under 18. Im guessing this has something to do with the brain development. Next thing is that it might encourage suicidal/selfharming thoughts and/or behaviors. I have struggled with both before. I should probably also note that I take pills with Hyporicum Perforatum daily to help me with my depression (its been working so-so). In regards to that the instructions said that Trazodone in combination with Hyporicum Perforatum might make the side effects i mentioned above appear more often. Now, since I\u2019d have to take so little Im not sure if its better to take it regardless since sleeping well would be nice once in a while and it would also help me be better in school, this way it\u2019d do more good than harm. What would you recommend I do?"

The iron is coated special by Rite Aid (according to them that is why it was $55 and not over the counter) to help it not bother my stomach.

I now have both my regular doctors available again but I have been instructed to keep taking the current meds above. My asthma/allergies gave me a 4-month recovery time from bronchitis 2 years ago so my Dr is taking the precautions to hit this with all we've got this year, which dripped my recovery to 1 month this time around. My next appointment is Sept 19, and am hoping to cut some of the meds off at that time. I suspect the iron will be around to stay for a while.\n\nAny ideas on what could be causing this? Any suggestions on how to better tolerate the iron? I get.mixed instructions on whether I should be taking it with a full or empty stomach.\n\nThanks!"

The pain in my lower back radiates to my buttocks. For years I've been feeling a strong pulse around my belly button and when I lay down I can see my abdomen pulsating. But recently I've noticed a lump growing on the right side of my belly button (I attached 2 pics). Also, for years I've been having severe blotaing after eating and constipation. Two years ago I told my gastroenterologist that I could feel my pulse in my abdomen and she advised me to get an ultrasound. When I went to get the ultrasound done, the doctor rushed through the appointment saying it was impossible that I could have an abdominal anueyrsm, making me feel like it was all in my head. He checked me with the ultrasound machine for like a minute and said everything was fine and that I did not have any visceral or vascular issues. But now, with the pain and the lump growing I'm thinking that maybe he missed the anuerysm (is it hard to miss an aneurysm doing an ultrasound?). I've read it's uncommon for young people to have anuerysms... But if it's not an aneurysm, what could it be? Umbilical hernia? A cyst? I don't know, I'm thinking about getting an appointment with my doctor, but I don't want to be treated again like I'm crazy and like it's all in my head.\n\nLump in the abdomen:\n\nhttps://m.imgur.com/a/jjqgSPo"

I graduated college about 2 weeks ago, but once I had finished i had a stress breakdown and I crashed. These past couple of weeks have just been filled with anxious and worrying thoughts and im never sure if what im feeling is because of stress or because there's something legitimately wrong with me. \n\nThe problem started on the 14th of August when i finished college. I thought i was just getting a fever but it was being acompanied by dizziness and tension headaches around my temples. I also felt a slight shortness of breath and a loss of my appetite. From then on i kept thinking in my head that i had aquried some terminal illness or a brain tumor. I wasnt having any major physical symptoms other tham the ones i listed, but my anxiety was causing me to have tons of rapid and worrying thoughts. fast forward till now, im feeling a lot better physically, but my brain is still latching onto these worrying thoughts. I still have it in my head that i have a brain tumor even though im not experiencing any symptoms that could relate to having a tumor, other than maybe a bit of dizziness and the occasional mild headache. \n\nI seem to have become hypersensitive to the things i hear and the things i see. I keep thinking im hallucinating when i see little dots floating at the corner of my eye, but then when i turn around it turns out to be a speck on the wall or a fly buzzing past me. Im still able to sleep and just recently ive been able to regain my appetite slightly, but other than that im not able to do things i normally do.\n\nI saw my doctor about this a week and a half ago. She had told me that my brain had sort of a short circut and it caused me to crash and all of my stress just came up to me behind my back. I was perscribed a small dosage of Trazodone as a trial to see how i feel in a couple weeks (which is why it was listed). Although this appointment did put me a bit at ease, my brain still doesnt seem to be convinced.\n\nI think this is a result of marijuana which is why i quit after i had that breakdown earlier this month. I figured that since it was increasing my anxiety slightly each time after i did it, when it mixed with the stress i had a total meltdown and crashed. \n\nIf anyone can give me advice thatd be great. Im not sure if there is much else i can do other than just stay calm, keep taking my meds and just let it ease out of my system, but if anyone has any recommendations or has experienced something similar to this, please let me know. \n\nIf anyone has futher questions ill be more than willing to answer them."

The ticks would get worse anytime I missed a klonopin dose and I began to realize how my body was dependent on it even when I didn't want to take it and would purposely skip doses.\n\nFebruary 2014 I began to lose weight and the pain got more manageable, it wasn't gone but I was able to walk and live a somewhat normal life despite my mental health running rapid. As my depression got worse in 2015 I gained about 60 pounds back but my back wasn't hurting like before but I was in and out of the emergency room every 6 months for sharp abdominal pain that didn't show up on any CT scans. I slept all day and didn't have energy to get out of bed or let alone leave my house\n\nIn 2016 I was doing orange theory fitness to try and lose weight and made one wrong move and all my symptoms came back. Stabbing, throbbing left side lower back pain that felt like it had a focal point but the sensation would move around. I couldn't work or leave the house for 6 months and again the MRI showed nothing so the doctors pretty much told me to deal.\n\n2017  I went back to teaching yoga full time again and my pain started getting a little more manageable. I got a shady doctor to prescribe me phentermine for weight loss and lost 70 pounds over the next year. I was in the ER three times that year for abdominal/pelvic pain that they couldn't find the source of. Each time it mimicked the symptoms of a UTI accompanied with abdominal pain but nothing on CT showed up. I quit my job in October and was involved in lots of cocaine/alcohol/suboxone use with the guy I was seeing as well as acting out with LOTS of different sexual partners through October 2018.\n\nOctober 2018 I decided to cold turkey off of the klonopin(3mg for 11 years), ambien and phentermine because I felt like I was going crazy. I ended up having multiple seizures, in and out of the ER 4x with hallucinations, tennitus, muscle aches, memory loss, insomnia..ect. I didn't realize Benzo withdraws could kill you because to me it was always \"my medication\" not a drug (not once did any doctor ever suggest I come off of it in all the year). Ended up reinstating and doing a slow taper that ended in May 2019. My psych put me on 1800mg of gabapentin to help with the back pain and withdraws as well as 50mg of vistaril 2x a day for anxiety.\n\nMarch 2019.. I had gained about 25 pounds after coming off of the phentermine but was experiencing symptoms that mimicked a UTI but wasn't. they kept treating me for UTI and yeast infection even though the tests came back negative. Burning, discharge, odor, frequency, incontinence and abdominal pain. the pain was so great that I went to the emergency room 2x. The CT scans came back clear and they basically told me to fuck off. The lower back pain got so bad I couldn't leave my house for 6 months again.. sleeping for 14-16 hours at a time most days.\n\nMay 2019 I gained another 25 pounds and went away to my 20th(?) eating disorder treatment program. While there, I complied with meal plans and treatment protocol but my pain was getting progressively worse. My constipation had gotten worse (on average I poop 2x a week for years) and had gone over 2 weeks without a bowel movement.  When I do go it is diarrhea or pebbles. My blood pressure was around 150/104 consistently 3x a day for about a month.It comes in flair ups where some days the pain is manageable (never goes away) and others its completely debilitating. They put me on propalonol and after 3 weeks it dropped back down to the high normal end. I started experiencing terrible indigestion, bloating, dizziness. My skin and hair began to become abnormally greasy and was put on spironolactone that I ended up stopping after a couple of weeks since it hadn't gotten my period for a couple of months and didn't want to mess with my hormones.\n\nI ended up back in the hospital mid May because the vaginal burning and back pain was so bad. I was peeing up to 25x a day, couldn't sleep because it would wake me up, got an abcess right outside my vulva and had to change my underwear 3x a day from leakage. They did an ultrasound and found two complex cysts on my left ovary (told me it was nothing to worry about and told me it couldn't possibly be causing my pain). The doctor told me it was inter cystal cystitis (without testing for it), gave me pain killers and dismissed me after about an hour. I went to a urologist who performed a cystostopy and showed me that my bladder was spazzing and asked me if I had fibroids(which I didn't think I did).  He was very condescending and basically told me it wasn't in his scope of practice anymore it was gynecological.  I went to the gynocologist and tested for STDS and UTI (again) and both came back negative. She referred me back to the urologist and mentioned a laparoscopic procedure to check for endometriosis. I started experiencing terrible indigestion and\n\nLate July I relapsed on bulimia after feeling helpless with my medical problems. I started experiencing numbness an shooting pain down my right side now as well as the left. My bladder would not stop spasming.  I had to come back home to the east coast because the pain was getting worse and I wanted to be with family and see doctors here. I got another lumbar spine MRI and there is nothing on there that explains the pain I am in. I am seeing a pelvic rehabilitation specialist who is doing steroid injections and suggesting its endometriosis.\n\nI have had such bad experiences with doctors and hospitals, no one believes my pain is there because nothing is showing up. I swear im not crazy and I feel like no-one wants to help me and they're going to let me die before they find whats wrong with me.

It's around my breastbone or at the \"base\" or like \"inside\" either breast, comes and goes, alternating locations. I had this a few weeks ago, it went away and now it's back. I  wouldn't call it pain, it's like a 1 or 2 out of 10. Maybe I'd call it tightness. No trouble breathing. \n\nAntacids help sometimes but not other times. Ibuprofen doesn't do anything.

Putting pressure on my chest or breasts seems to help relieve a little. \n\nI have some heart palpitations sometimes but it could well be that I'm freaking myself out (history of anxiety) or just that I'm overweight and I've had them before.

I have been experience some facial aches, primarily in the jaw area, but occasionally in other parts of my head as well. I noticed it around Monday or Tuesday, where most of my jaw seemed to be aching. I felt around inside my mouth and I didn't feel anything unusual. On one of the days, the pain would occasionally shoot to my ear, but otherwise remained in the jaw location. It has gradually gotten better as the pain is mostly gone now, but as of writing this post, I still feel some minor discomfort/aching, but it seems to keep alternating to different parts of my face and it's at the point where I can mostly ignore it and have almost forgotten about it. As the jaw aches were alleviated, I felt it go up to my cheekbones. \n\nI don't think it's anything serious, but I'm asking here anyway to get a professional's opinion. \n\nAs a kid, I had a bad habit of grinding my teeth, so that may be the root of it, and I may still do it occasionally without realizing it. What I found to help was wearing retainers or mouth guards throughout the day at work. I work a full-time job and it can be a little stressful at times, so maybe this is something stress related?  Oh, and I also have health anxiety, so maybe that is another possible cause?  \n\n\nThanks!"

She went into hypovolemic shock(looked like septic shock.) her fever was incredibly high &amp; she turned blue, breathing rapidly, and shaking. The doctor gave her a ton of antibiotic and steroid shots right away (thinking it was meningitis) and she looked 100% better by the time she arrived at the children\u2019s hospital. (She was airlifted.) we stayed for about 3 days and they did a kidney ultrasound and x ray which showed she had a kidney infection in both of her kidneys. \n\nI took her back home once her infection seemed better and continued antibiotics for 10 days even though she had antibiotics IV for 3-4 days. She was healthy &amp; happy again! I took her to get a VCUG to see if she has kidney reflux to be the cause of the kidney infection and it was NEGATIVE.\n\nAbout 4 days ago she was perfectly fine. Until once again- I noticed a fever.\n\nI took her back to the ER, got prescribed antibiotics and Tylenol. I went home and gave her first dose of antibiotics and within 3 hours- she was at 105.6 fever! We went back to the ER. She turned blue again, mottled, and started breathing fast again and looking SO scared. The same doctor who airlifted her was there and said they NEED to figure this out. another UTI and kidney infection. She sent us back to the children\u2019s hospital. We have been here for 3 days. They did another kidney ultrasound and didn\u2019t see anything wrong other than a kidney infection. It hurts to hold her, she\u2019s in so much pain. At this point the doctors have no clue what could be causing it so they are blaming it on \u201cbeing a girl and getting frequent UTIs are common\u201d \n\nI do not see how getting two UTIs in one month and TWO kidney infections in one month is normal. So here we are. She has gotten ultrasounds done, VCUG, blood work. Her blood work is SO abnormal but they say it\u2019s because of the infection. Her CRP level yesterday (after one day of antibiotics) was 21.1 which is high. A normal CRP for her age is 1.0. Well today they tested again and her CRP is 22.1. so now they are going to check again tomorrow.\n\nSomeone tell me- am I wrong for wanting this figured out?!! Please if you have any idea please just comment, I am so worried that this is going to keep happening and she may not make it next time. She is clearly sick and something is causing this. I just know it. \n\nI\u2019m going to put her blood work below on what\u2019s high and low.

Sometimes so bad it wasn't even washing off unless I washed twice. I got little teeny tiny pimples all over my forehead. Doctor wouldn't listen to my concern with this sudden oiliness and prescribed topical clindamycin phosphate or \"just get on birth control\" which has historically made me extremely depressed. The topical gel made it worse and worse. I self-diagnosed myself with fungal acne and the small bumps disappeared with Nizoral shampoo. The primary care doctor tested my hormones and said I seem normal.\n\nBut the greasiness continued and I got painful, giant cystic pimples. I've never ever had these before. I kept using the antibiotic the doctor gave and stridex and tea tree oil face washes and washed my pillows with hot water and vinegar in case it was from that. Every time a cystic zit would disappear, a new one would appear somewhere else on my face.\n\nAlong with all of this, my depression were getting worse and worse. I was having suicidal thoughts and helpless feelings and intense apathy. I wasn't feeling anything and didn't want to do anything. It was scary, as if I wasn't on medication. I made an appointment with the therapist who suggested that it was from the stress of being in school and working full-time. The psychiatrist suggested I keep trying to de-stress before adding another medication or switching.\n\nBefore I would have an anxiety/depression episode just the day before my period. Easier to cry, over no reason sometimes. I would always realize it was hormonal when my period started the next day.\n\nNow I have pretty consistent intense depression and anxiety about a week or two before my period. This last week I started crying due to random minor stress. Like almost full on breakdown. My period had ended the week before, so I figured it was not hormonal, but then the next day I started spotting and this continued for a week.\n\nA few days after the spotting stopped, I got anxious again and was in \"end of the world\" mode. I know these thoughts are not real, but the feeling is still there. Then the next day, again spotting.\n\nI have an appointment with a gynecologist Monday because my primary care refuses to really listen to me. Could it be something to do with my pituitary gland or ovaries? I've felt this for several months now and in case I can't get a second opinion in my medical group I'm asking here to be better prepared for the conversation with my doctor."

I have undiagnosed symptoms and really need help. I do not know if this is related, but back in October I had flu like symptoms that lasted for about 2 weeks. I had fevers and chills, as well as muscle spasms and joint pain. Six weeks prior to this I had unprotected sex (not sure if that was related). Fast forward to February, I started experiencing a series of strange symptoms. First it started with a really intense chill that ran through my legs and to my butt. The chill was so intense that it was painful. Then there was an instance where a wave went over me and I felt like I was going to fall over. Soon after I started experiencing tingling in my brain and stomach. After a few days, the tingling went away as well, but I've noticed lasting damage. After the tingling my face started to twitch for a few days, my lip as well as the area above my eyebrow. This too went away, but the issues that remain have to do with my brain itself. I no longer have the same cognitive ability. I used to have a sense of humor, but that is completely gone now. I cannot think of simple things to say. I tried doing simple math, and it was a struggle for me. Also, I used to be extremely ticklish, but now I feel nothing to that sort of touch. I've also noticed I never feel hungry anymore, like, my brain doesn't tell me when to eat (never get hunger pains, growling tummy). Anyway, I thought this could somehow be related to me having unprotected sex. I was struggling to find answers through this and read that HIV can cause CNS/brain issues. But I've been tested for everything and came out clean. I also did an MRI on my brain and everything appeared normal. I don't know if this is a post viral syndrome type issue or a neurological problem. I really need help. This has essentially ruined my life and I'm desperate for answers as doctors I've contacted seek to have no explanations for me."

Nobody. Everybody thinks I'm crazy, including doctors. All of this started 2 months ago when I got home from college for summer break. I started doing exercise that involved a lot of jumping and overexerted myself a couple times. That was what started everything. My symptoms pretty much started immediately, but they have progressed and changed over time. Here is what's going on currently:\n\n\\- Very hard pulsating of the arteries in my temples (both sides) that I can clearly feel underneath the skin.\n\n\\- Pressure (not pain) in my head that is pretty much constant from the moment I wake up in the morning. Gets worse whenever I stand up or sit in chair at a desk.\n\n\\- Neck stiffness and pain (only on the left side from the base of the skull down to the shoulder).\n\n\\- Gastrointestinal problems that almost solely occur first thing in the morning (can feel gurgling and stomach acids squirting almost every day, recurring loose stools that are bright yellow in color and have a repulsive odor, and gas).\n\n\\- Occasional dizzy spells that are sometimes really intense and make me feel like I am going to collapse. These are usually accompanied by my forehead getting insanely hot to the touch.\n\n\\- Drowsiness and always feeling the need to put my head down or lay down in bed.\n\n\\- Occasional loss of appetite.\n\n\\- Weight loss (started off at around 210 pounds when this all began; I was 194 when I last weighed myself).\n\n\\- Mild trembling (especially in hands).\n\n\\- Fluttering eyelids when I close my eyes.\n\n\\- Persistent low-grade fevers (usually in between the 98.9-99.4 range).\n\n\\- Occasional dehydration.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI will admit it, I am a serious hypochondriac which is in part due to the fact that my dad passed away from leukemia when I was very young. So naturally when all my symptoms began, I really freaked the fuck out and immediately starting fearing the worst. Here is the ridiculous amount of tests that I have gotten done and the insanely strange things that have been found so far:\n\n\\- 2 MRIs of my brain (without contrast): both came back normal.\n\n\\- MRI of my neck: found 4 degenerating, slightly bulging discs in my cervical spine, reversal of the cervical curvature of the spine, diagnosed with mild degenerative disc disease, radiologist said it was like a 2-3/10 in terms of how bad it was and probably wasn't causing my symptoms.\n\n\\- MANY a blood test (15+ times): this is where shit gets REALLY weird. In every single blood test I've had done, the CBC always came back totally normal (normal white blood cell count, red blood cell count, etc.). I have also been tested for hepatitis, hyperthyroidism, inflammation, autoimmune diseases, you name it - nothing. Even an AFP tumor marker came back normal. The ONLY THING that they did find was a mono screening that came back positive (twice). I got these tests done at the same emergency room and they both came back positive. HOWEVER, I also got 2 other mono tests done at different locations and they both came back negative. So the order of the results was: positive, negative, positive, negative... which makes no fucking sense whatsoever. Even the doctors were baffled. They agreed that something was indeed causing that mono screen to come back positive, but they don't know what. I never really had any of the classic symptoms of mono, so I doubt I ever had it. Regardless, it makes no fucking sense at all.\n\n\\- Handful of urine tests (about 3-4): all came back normal, no infections.\n\n\\- 3 stools tests: first one checked for occult bleeding and found none. Second one detected no bacteria and FEW blastocystis species (a type of parasite). Third one detected no bacteria and no parasites (all done subsequently).\n\n\\- Rectal exam: no rectal bleeding was found\n\n\\- Chest x-ray: came back normal\n\n\\- Upper endoscopy: inflammation of my esophagus and stomach was detected, diagnosed with gastritis without bleeding\n\n\\- Colonoscopy: came back normal\n\n\\- Eye examination: came back normal, no damage to the optic nerve or increased pressure in the eyes that could be symptomatic of a brain tumor\n\n\\- EKG: came back normal\n\n\\- Ultrasound of abdomen: came back normal\n\nAlso, I do not have high blood pressure.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWith all of that, it is really hard to see what is causing my symptoms. On paper, I seem to be rather healthy, but I feel like total crap every single day. Also, because of this mystery medical condition, I am have become very depressed, upset, and paranoid. I feel like I am going to die if I don't get this figured out eventually and have had nightmares about losing my loved ones. I cry multiple times a day and am constantly on edge.

I am not asking for a diagnosis, just some suggestions about what this could be or other things I should try. I don't want to die. I want my old life back. Please help me, thanks."

Sometimes associated with excessive bowel movement (not diarrhea). I have been screaming in pain on the floor and been in an ambulance begging them to sedate me. The pain is something I don\u2019t wish upon anyone. I have been to the ED over 20 times. All blood work fine, all scans show nothing exciting but once my lymph nodes on lower right quadrant were inflamed in 2017. They no longer are. Ultra sounds are clean. Pap smear unremarkable. The pain starts out of no where and feels like period cramps times 1000. Sometimes I need to have bowel movements with it sometimes not. Bowel movements do not help with pain. No over the counter medicine even comes close to touching it. The best thing that helps is a really hot bath, and that can be a hit or miss. I refuse to fly on a plane because of it. After having physical therapy for a year and a half along with trigger point injections I got a ob/gyn to do a laparoscopy on me to look for endometriosis. He didn\u2019t find it but found adhesions on my colon of the right of my abdominal wall in the right lower quadrant (where my pain is the worst). I have yet to have a follow up to see if this is the reason behind all this and if so can anything be done. Is this the answer I have been looking for? 7 years of being told it\u2019s because \u201cI\u2019m female\u201d, \u201cidk\u201d, and \u201cit\u2019s all in my head\u201d. My appt is next week my laparoscopy was 3 weeks ago. I have never been able to work full time due to this problem."

I have been on Effexor (Venlafaxine) for I think 2-3 years now and am starting to think it's not the best for me. I've looked into some effects of Effexor through medical sites/subreddits/doctors/other Redditors who have also been on Effexor and many of them I have or have something similar to.\n\n1. The bad sleep. I have never slept good all my life but that could've been due to the OSA. Now the sleep issue has slightly changed but is no way better. Now I wake up really early and can't get back to sleep. Also, the time I am asleep doesn't do much for me. I still wake up really tired and am like that through the day. The Melatonin helps me to fall asleep and the Trazodone is supposed to help me stay asleep but that isn't working too well.\n2. If I miss a dose of my meds I get a really bad headache, nausea, tiredness, aches, and \"Brain Zaps\" as other I've heard other people call them.\n3. I sweat A LOT. Through the day I'm constantly sweating. My shirts start to show sweat through them after a while because of it. I can be sitting down doing practically nothing all day and I will still sweat. Also, I sweat a ton through the night. I will fall asleep not being even warm but I will wake up with my pajamas and covers soaked in sweat. I think some of this is just genetics because my dad sweats a lot too but that's only when he's doing things that would make you sweat (he just sweats a lot).\n4. I don't know if this is really related or not but I have pretty bad acne too. It's on my face, back and shoulders. I take showers every day and wash my face too.\n5. Sometimes, random muscles in my body will just twitch for a bit. IDK if that's related but I just thought I'd mention it in case.\n\nI guess what I'm trying to get from this is if you have any recommendations as to what to do or things to bring up with my Psychiatrist at the next meeting, please let me know. I want to figure out what's best for me finally. Any help is greatly appreciated."

I can walk for miles on a flat surface but as soon as stairs, ladders, or hills come into effect, I wont last long right now. I also have winded myself eating too fast. Another problem that I'm having along side with this is chest pain in the top of my chest and on either side. I think it's due to strain from labored breathing but I'm unsure. Any if the tests they've done(xray and stethoscope exam) have been clear. I have no signs of infection and no rattling or odd sounds in my chest. I find it very difficult to take a full deep breath due to discomfort and it feels like there is a sort of block that prevents me from doing so. If I were to breath normally, it almost feels like a reflex to exhale that air... like someone is pushing on my chest to get it out. My last lung function test was on October and the one before that was last June. Both tests showed that there was an obstruction, both showed that my lung volume was pretty much normal and both showed that my exhaling force is really weak. \n\nAny ideas?"

From 69kg I'm down to 66kg in two weeks. During one of my walks, I was imagining that I'm about to cliff dive, but during one of the redo-s of the jump I suddenly couldn't see in my mind's eye the karst tower and the surrounding low lying beach and sea where my imagined self was. Thinking my imagination was just impaired that one time, and shrugged it off due to exhaustion.\n\nBut being used to detailed daydreams since I was little , maybe one or two simultaneously happening as I go through the day's tasks (like parallel processes or two windows open on a screen, plus whatever's happening irl), as well as having immersive ones during commutes and bed time, I try to concentrate back to vivid imaginings - to no avail. If i try too hard, I get a weird sensation, and even then the secondary person i'm interacting in the daydream doesn't feel natural and sometimes fades, and all the background characters that used to do their own thing aren't even there. The background setting is all black now, too. It's frustrating how much I notice little artifacts on what's happening in reality now, and boring and lonely and sad without the daydreams. My head is quieter too, and my inner voice(s?) now seem like a monologue rather than a dialogue, if that makes any sense. Also, I've been very slow on thinking, and it's taking me a lot of time to hear words/meanings properly, and a bit forgetful.\n\nHas anyone else had problems/experiences like this? How can I increase my concentration/bring back the daydreams? Losing something so integral feels like a bad glitch. /Sorry for the incoherent and weird first post.

There's also a really bad smell whenever she goes to the bathroom. Five days ago, she started urinating blood (rather severe amounts). She did not report other related issues, like a burning sensation.\n\nThe problem is, she ABSOLUTELY refuses to go see a doctor, no matter what. She'd rather literally die. Yes, I know people are going to be saying she needs help etc etc, but trust me - it's impossible. I have been trying to convince her to go to a doctor with her issues for at least 5 years. This sort of runs in the family, as well. Her father had gallbladder pain, and decided to commit suicide instead of going to see a doctor.\n\nAnyway, by using common sense, and a bit of google, I obviously think this is a rather advanced urinary tract infection. By some miracle of sorts, I went to a doctor when I was abroad in France last month, and got prescribed antibiotics for a weak cold - which I did not end up taking, as he did not really run any real tests, he just looked at me and shrugged it off with antibiotics.\n\nTherefore I happen to have a complete package of antibiotics \"on hand\", and by some kind of miracle, these are apparently the ones being used to treat UTIs. A downside is that I left them at work in France, and can only get a hold of them in about a week, when one of my colleagues is to return back here.\n\nMy question is: is it safe to have her take the antibiotics? Are there any precautions that I should take? I should remind you that there are only two options: either having her take them or doing nothing at all...  \n\n\nBelow are the details about the antibiotics:\n\nActive substance:  **Cefixime** \\- I'm pretty sure I have the 200mg per pill variant, but apparently, 40mg and 100mg variants also exist. I could be wrong, so please take this into consideration - I can't verify it for sure as I don't have the pills on hand yet.\n\nMed name: **Oroken** : I found a link to it online, but seems to be French only, sorry : [http://www.doctissimo.fr/medicament-OROKEN.htm](http://www.doctissimo.fr/medicament-OROKEN.htm)\n\nIt's supposed to be taken twice a day, and I have two packets of 8 - therefore I have enough for 8 days.  \n\n\nAll in all, is this a good idea? If you have any questions whose answering would help in making this decision, I can ask my mother and forward the info here."

Ever since I started puberty (age 12),  I would get cramps so painful that sometimes I would faint.  Over time, my period got worse and worse to the point where I would have to take medication to stop the bleeding because my period would go on for the entire month and as soon as it would stop, my next period would start again. When I was 15 I couldn't take it anymore and started on birth control and have been on it ever since.  My doctor recommended me to a gynaecologist, I did an ultrasound to check for endometriosis and bloodwork for hormonal imbalances but everything seemed fine, other than the fact that I was slightly anemic.\n\nI have always had \"growing pains\" from a young age as well as frequent mouth ulcers.  I was told many times that this was normal and would go away as I get older.  \n\nWhen I was 17 I started University. This is where shit started to hit the fan.  It started with my joint pain getting much worse.  Most days I couldn't sit through an entire hour of class because my left hip would hurt so much.  There were days where my finger joints were so swollen I couldn't make a fist.  My entire left side of my body was in so much pain, and there was visible swelling in my knees, fingers and wrist, all while the right side of my body was perfectly normal.  I went to the doctor and she said it was just stress.  My muscles in my butt and thigh would hurt so bad it constantly felt like my muscles were cramping even though they weren't, and if I tried to flex the muscle the pain would intensify x10, it left me bed-bound.\n\nMy oral ulcers started to become a lot more frequent and very very large.  I would get clusters of them everywhere: my inner cheeks, the roof of my mouth, on my tonsils, in my throat.  My dentist said they were the largest he had ever seen and told me to get an endoscopy; my family doctor refused and attributed it to stress.\n\nOver the next couple years my joint pain stayed consistent, it never went away.  My ulcers never went away (new ones forming as old ones healed).  I gained 30 pounds.  I started to get periods of confusion, where I would say sentences that make absolutely no sense, sometimes I wouldn't know where I am, sometimes my vision was very distorted as if I was looking through a kaleidoscope.\n\nI started getting skin sensitivity when exposed to sunlight and what looked like a butterfly rash on my face.  It was at this point that I was recommended to a rheumatologist.  He thought my periods of confusion sounded like partial-seizures and did many many tests on me over the years: I had tests for lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, sacroidosis, ankylosing spondylitis, srojens syndrome, multiple sclerosis, and more that I can't even remember. Everything came back negative.  I went on plaquenil as he suspected lupus even with the negative test.\n\n2 years go by with plaquenil and it helped! I was mostly normal,  only thing that persisted was the joint/muscle pain but now it was only in my hip and shoulder instead of the entire left side of my body. My ulcers went down significantly ....\n\nuntil last year.  Ulcers came back worse than before.  I started having left-side body pain.  I was getting weekly migranes that would last 3 days at a time.  Kaleidoscope vision. And then, uveitis. The first time I had uveitis I was afraid to go to the doctor because at this point I had seen her so many times with complaints and no diagnosis and I seriously think she thinks I am crazy.  Long story short I left it for too long and almost went blind in my left eye.\n\nI eventually got it treated, and 4 months later it came back in my right eye.  4 months after that it came back in both eyes.  I have permanent vision loss in both eyes and scar tissue, and after seeing an ophthalmologist he told me that it looks like I have had inflammation in my eyes for a very long time and never noticed, so now I have to take prolensa every day to keep my eyes from getting even worse.  \n\nMy rheumatologist now thinks it isn't lupus because uveitis is very rare in lupus, and I had a negative test. He then tested me for behcets disease since I fit a lot of the symptoms. At this point he put me on jamp-colcinine for my joint pain. Once again the blood tests came back negative.  Now he is saying he exhausted all his ideas and is starting to think that there is nothing wrong with me.  \n\nI am beyond frustrated, I know that there are people with way worse situations than me, but my migranes and constant left-sided body pain, along with the pain and vision loss with uveitis, and the pain from my ulcers, is really making it hard for me to live day-to-day life.\n\nI really believe there is something not right with me, but that maybe it is just not autoimmune since those came back negative.  My doctor doesn't want to refer me to any other specialists because she still thinks it is all just stress. Am I crazy? Is this all in my head?  \n\nI have only ever done blood tests and one chest x-ray , are there other tests I can request that could help?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNote: I have also tested for toxoplasmosis, tuberculosis, and sti's like HIV/Aids, syphillis, and everything came back negative."

Essay incoming.\n\n29/F/USA, white, 4'10\" tall, 100lbs, gym 3+ days a week and not sedentary, healthy diet, family history of Graves disease, NO FAMILY HISTORY of any type of diabetes, alcohol consumption is 1 drink 1-3 times a week although less recently, currently on Ortho-cyclin for birth control, was on spironolactone 50mg daily for last 2 years (brief stint of about 4 months at 75mg last spring) but GP told me to stop taking it on discovery of elevated fasting glucose at my physical in May. Previous history of Orthorexia/ARFID in early 20s, would consider well managed for the past 4 years.\n\nWent to GP at beginning of May (5/7) this year for physical and to get a referral so my insurance would cover my dermatologist appointments for the year. Metabolic panel came back with fasting glucose of 210 and an A1C of 8.7. GP called me back into the office 2 days later and did a finger stick to confirm there wasn't a lab error. I wasn't told the number, but I was told it wasn't a lab error. He told me to discontinue spironolactone as it might be a side effect of that, and we'd recheck in a week. I demanded a referral to an endocrinologist (jackass fought me on that and I'm still mad) and a dietician due to previous history with eating disorder and his vague dietary guidelines (that I was already following!) being triggering for me. C-peptide and Insulin labs were ordered and I returned in a week for the results and to recheck finger stick. Next appointment glucose reading was 267, C-peptide was 1.13, and Insulin was 6.4. He diagnosed me with Type 2 diabetes and put me on 500mg Metformin extended release once daily with the plan being that once my body adjusted and the GI symptoms dissipated, my dosage would be gradually raised. I was told the goal would be 2000mg daily and I would likely need additional medication (didn't say what) due to the numbers we'd seen.\n\nI saw the dietician the next day and she reviewed my diet with me and as suspected, it was healthy. I was given instructions to eat every 5 hours, meals should be 30g of carbs (breakfast and dinner can be 30-45,) and snacks should be 15g. She suspected I had type 1.5 and I should see an endocrinologist. Spent the next 4 days feeling awful and on the verge of shitting myself if I bent over due to Metformin. Also had to reduce weight used at the gym by 10-15lbs due to weakness. Saw GP again on Monday. Fasting glucose was 94, he stammered that was a \"profound response and I might not need to be on the medication,\" but had no suggestion as to how to figure that out. He asked when I saw the endocrinologist, I told him Thursday, and then he said ok and bolted out of the room.\n\nSaw the endocrinologist that Thursday (5/23 at this point) and she was baffled by the whole thing. She decided I likely had PCOS due to the fact that I'd been on spironolactone for hormonal acne and the fact that my cycle used to be irregular before I started contraceptive pills 9 years ago. She took me off the Metformin because she was concerned about it causing lows, I was finally taught how to use a glucose meter, and I was given instructions to test twice a day, fasting and 2 hours after dinner. If I was over 120 fasting or 160 post-meal I was supposed to restart Metformin. Follow up appointment in 3 weeks with bloodwork and urine sample due a week earlier.\n\nI accidentally overdid it on the carbs at dinner a few days later and was at 244 two hours post-meal. Since I was told to take Metformin with food, I decided to wait and take it with breakfast the next morning rather than eating again while running high. Fasting glucose the next morning was 91. Opted to not take the metformin since my body seemed to be handling things and I wanted to know what my glucose levels would be without outside interference. I decided I'd intervene and take the medication if I had 2 or 3 out of range readings in a row. That never happened. Only other incident over 200 was due to my bf only having cinnamon raisin bagels for breakfast at his place. Still, my body handled it and that afternoon 233 was back down to 135 after dinner. I saw the endocrinologist again and told her what I was doing and what I'd observed and she shrugged and said \"sometimes we don't have a name for things,\" and diagnosed it as diabetes controlled by diet as that was the closest thing she felt she could say about what was happening. My labs had come back with ALT a smidge elevated at 30, but she said that was in the margin of error so it wasn't something to worry about. Fasting glucose was 73, and A1C was down to 7.6. Follow up was set for September.\n\nAt this point I wasn't satisfied so I started checking my glucose more frequently since I figured more data meant a more detailed picture. I noticed that glucose management issues were a possible side effect of my birth control pill so I made an appointment to see my Ob/Gyb and talk to her about the endocrinologist's PCOS theory as well as my pills. She told me I'm not displaying PCOS symptoms and that glucose management issues would have shown up when I started the pill I'm currently taking, not after taking it for 3 or 4 years. Then I had a follow up appointment with my dietician and she encouraged me to see a different endocrinologist who was more willing to play detective since nothing was adding up. I took her advice and made an appointment at the practice she recommended.\n\nWhile waiting to get in to see the new endocrinologist I had an appointment to get my eyes checked. The PA was shocked to see type 2 on my medical history and told me that he had a similar experience. It turned out that in his case he\u2019d had a stomach ulcer causing gastroparesis and treating the ulcer got rid of the blood sugar problems. Both the PA and the optometrist found no problem with my eyes and said they were in excellent health. Optometrist echoed the dietician\u2019s concerns.\n\nWent to the new endocrinologist\u2019s office and saw a PA. I showed her the food and glucose journal I\u2019d been keeping and, surprise surprise, I\u2019m apparently really weird. She asked why no one checked for type 1 antibodies and suggested it might be LADA, which made sense to me based on the research I\u2019d been doing since this all started as well as my body consistently being able to clear any highs I was experiencing. She ordered labs to check everything, again, as well as type 1 antibodies and thyroid labs at my request. I left that appointment sure I was dealing with LADA, and much less stressed since we\u2019d know how to treat it once that suspicion was confirmed. Follow up was supposed to be a month later.\n\nI got all the lab work done the next week (7/17) since I wanted to know what was going on ASAP. Checked the results on the online portal as soon as they came in Monday morning and, you can guess where this is going, I was NEGATIVE for type 1 antibodies. Fasting glucose was 93, thyroid was normal, kidneys were fine, liver fine (ALT was back down to 22), cholesterol was excellent, c-pep was 1.05, insulin was 6.8, A1C was down again to 6.4. What the fuck, right?\n\nSaw my dermatologist that morning and told her I\u2019d stopped taking the spiro, lol. I filled her in on everything and she asked if any imaging had been ordered and floated the idea of a tumor. She was very clear that this wasn\u2019t her area of expertise and she was just speculating, but I made note to ask the endocrinologist about it later.\n\nCalled the endocrinologist\u2019s office that afternoon to move up my follow up appointment. Was able to talk to the endocrinologist that Thursday and was told that due to the lab results my diagnosis was type 2. She said there wasn\u2019t any kind of imaging that could be done, but they could do genetic testing to check for MODY. I\u2019ve opted to investigate other avenues seeing as genetic testing wouldn\u2019t be covered by my insurance and I\u2019m unlikely to be the first in my family with MODY. She did say that it\u2019s possible, although a slim chance, that I still have LADA as there are 5 possible antibodies that can be present for that but only 3 they can look for with labs. I brought up what I\u2019d heard from the optometrist\u2019s PA and my GP\u2019s dismissal of my GI issues and she said it would be worth investigating those although it\u2019s a long shot.\n\nSwitched to an internal medicine doctor instead of a GP for primary care. She thought I was joking about the type 2 diagnosis at first. Told her the spiel, got a referral to a gastroenterologist and a prescription for Prilosec. Saw the gastroenterologist last Monday and he got the spiel. He also asked if any imaging had been done. He asked for my GI symptoms (severe bloating, gas, change in bowel movements, heartburn, acid reflux) and ordered testing to check my gut bacteria which are scheduled for about a week from now. He also ran a test for H. Pylori in office and I\u2019m assuming it was negative since I haven\u2019t heard back.\n\nHighest glucose level I\u2019ve had was 279, but it dropped to 69 three hours later. Lowest low I\u2019ve had was 58 in the afternoon a few days ago. Fasting is typically below 100 although I\u2019ve seen as high as 119. Usually my numbers are normal after breakfast, but if they\u2019re high at 2 hours post meal they drop to normal or even low at 3-4 hours. I thought I was seeing more lows after bowel movements, but that pattern isn\u2019t super consistent. I can handle cookies and milk better than whole grain crackers. The bread I use for toast at breakfast occasionally causes spikes if I make a sandwich with it for lunch. I\u2019m not seeing much consistency regarding my body\u2019s response to food. \n\nI guess my question is, should I talk to the internal medicine doctor about referring me out for any imaging? Do I try to spike myself over 250 and check for ketones before my body goes back to normal range in \\~3 hours? My gut is telling me this isn\u2019t type 2 because I have no risk factors for it and just treating it by policing my diet and monitoring my glucose levels feels like I\u2019m encouraging myself to relapse on my eating disorder and while I\u2019m currently managing that stress alright, I know it\u2019s not a sustainable way for me to live. What could be going on here?"

I\u2019ve been treating my depression, anxiety, and adhd mostly successfully until this past Monday when the depression seemed to come back full force. I\u2019m trying to figure out the best questions and things I should consider when advocating for help with my doctors and if there are any of my physical symptoms that Could be connected etc. I am currently on leave from work because my not being able to wake up on time and over all emotional state have been impacting my performance.\n\nMore context: I\u2019ve been working with my primary care doctor to address my physical symptoms. Which is how I learned that my magnesium seems to be low according to the range they provided. I had 1.7mg/dl. I emailed my doctor to ask about all the results but he has not responded yet. Can low magnesium cause my symptoms? Is there any other things that could be causing my symptoms? Are these symptoms potentially connected or no?\n\nphysical Symptoms: \n* Clenching my teeth while awake.\n* sometimes I have half of my scalp go numb on the left side. This has happened ever since I was little but have been happening more often like a few times a day and in a more specified area. Right now I feel it going numb. \n* A few weeks ago I had my heart doing a hiccup whoosh type feeling every 3-5mins for almost a week. Then one night I had a weird pain and got nauseous and went to sleep. The hiccup whoosh was gone when I woke up and before I could do the 24hr ekg. I still did the EKG but it only showed spikes in heart rate because I didn\u2019t have the whoosh while wearing it. \n* my joints and overall body just feels achy all the time. When I wake up I have to do a wobble type walk before my legs become less stiff and painful.\n* I usually only have diarrhea/ soft poop unless I\u2019m dehydrated and then I\u2019ll have a more solid or constipation.\n* Dry skin and acne type bumps on chest, arms ,neck and chin. It has now also migrated to my checks. It\u2019s like a few large ones in each of those areas.\n* I\u2019ve been bruising really easily.\n* I\u2019ve felt almost foggy and dizzy\n* nauseous\n* tired\n* hair has slowly thinned out the past year\n* have been having cramps in legs and once in my forearm this past week. I get cramps in my neck when I yawn.\n\nThe past few days I\u2019ve been extremely dizzy and tired. When I lay down the dizzy ness and nausea seem to be better. For the past few weeks I\u2019ve experienced a similar tiredness every few days that I shrugged off as being tired from work. I described it as \u201ccross eyed tired\u201d because it feels like my eyes want to cross and it\u2019s hard to focus.\n\n Any experiences or thoughts or information is helpful. I thank you in advance."

All 7 times gave been different places and several different cities. I'd say it was food poisoning but what are the chances I get it only when eating sushi each time at different places.

However, with people I\u2019m comfortable with that isn\u2019t a problem.\n\n-Very attentive memory, I tend to be able to memorize a lot of details of things my friends/peers cannot. For example, my memory of roads is very accurate.\n\n-Sensitivity to sounds, I feel physical pain/itching/cringing when I hear certain high pitches noise. \n\n-I don\u2019t mind hanging out with people, but I also don\u2019t mind social isolation.\n\nI can\u2019t tell if I\u2019m overthinking and just maybe think I have Aspergers, or I actually have Aspergers.

I also occasionally drink (a few drinks one night a week).\n\nIt all began in February, I was sitting in bed and began sneezing, and once I was done sneezing one side of my face was numb, which triggered what I can only imagine was a panic attack. I went to my GP and he ordered a brain MRI which came back normal besides acute sphenoid sinus disease.\n\nAbout a week later, I started to develop a variety of GI issues including: diarrhea, constipation, acid reflux, abdominal pain. I also have a strong visible pulsation in my abdomen, which I am unsure if it is related to the pain I feel. The pain is a constant dull ache with occasional sharp pains in different spots of my abdomen.\n\nI also experience chest pain, and a bounding pulse all over my body. My heart rate seems to be normal, somewhere between 65-85 mostly. I can feel my pulse in my abdomen, hands, and chest at just about every moment of the day. I also get muscle twitches all over my body frequently, and frequent episodes of tinnitus a handful of times a day. I have pain in my face that I believe to be related to sinus pressure from allergies so I am not concerned about that.\n\nThe tests I have received in addition to the brain MRI have been conducted by my gastroenterologist are a colonoscopy, which he found a benign polyp, an upper endoscopy, which he observed inflammation of the esophagus but otherwise normal, and an allergy panel which was normal as well.\n\nI am currently taking 40mg of omeprazole daily for the acid reflux, which has helped reduce heartburn but not eliminated it completely.\n\nMy question is, could all of these symptoms really be caused by anxiety? I had no history of anxiety before this, and I do not feel anxious except for when I think about the symptoms that I experience. So I do not believe my symptoms are caused by anxiety, rather my anxiety is caused by my symptoms. Any idea what could be causing my to experience these symptoms?"

I am not taking any medications, and have a PMH of anxiety/depression as well as painless swelling in my left ankle that lasted a couple months but has recently gone away (never got it checked out for financial reasons).\n\nAbout 3 days ago I started experiencing sharp pains on the left side of my chest while studying for finals. I was very stressed at the time and attributed it to a possible panic attack (I have experienced panic attacks in the past but never with any chest pains). I would say the pain lasted about 30-45 minutes while I was at rest and then subsided. What concerned me at the time was that I was also experiencing sharp pains in my left upper arm, but my friends assured me that I was having a panic attack because the pains were sharp rather than achy. Over the past few days I have continued to experience pain in my arm without any chest pain. There is no swelling or redness on my arm, but I did wake up the next day with a bruise in the area that I was experiencing pain.\n\nToday I woke up feeling very fatigued. I have been experiencing occasional sharp pains in my left arm throughout the day but again didn't think much of it. The pain does not seem to be associated with activity. About twenty minutes ago I  started experiencing sharp pains on the left side of my chest. I was studying with my classmates, who are all currently divided on if I should go get it checked out tonight. My roommate said she experienced similar chest pain in the exact same area which was due to inflammation and suggested I take naproxen, while my other friend is concerned it could be more serious and thinks I should go to the ER. The only things holding me back from going are the financial costs and the fact that I have multiple final exams in 2 days. I am currently struggling to pay my bills so I wanted to get some more advice before heading over. Should I go in tonight to get this checked out? I was always under the impression that any chest pain should be checked out ASAP, but some of my friends say otherwise. I'm not very educated on medical issues so I appreciate any advice. Thank you."

I assume I must've blown it (correct term?) when I was in pain. I haven't included a picture as I'm in bed next to my sleeping husband, but I just have to know... is it permanent?

I realize it's a bit ridiculous to be posting on a Reddit forum for medical opinions, but the doctors I've seen in real life seem largely unconcerned with my health problems and are unwilling to explore any options beyond the common/obvious, which have already been ruled out.\n\nI am 27, female, and live in western Canada. I am white, 5'4\", and 135lbs. My symptoms have been ongoing for a little over 7 months. I'm not on any medications (have a Mirena IUD though), and I don't have any pre-existing medical conditions before this. I traveled to Nepal and Thailand in the fall, and got home about a two weeks before my symptoms started... don't know if it's relevant.\n\nAt the end of December, I noticed a strange itch near the opening of my urethra. I went to the local sexual health clinic, but the LPN there said she didn't think it was an STI and it was probably just a skin irritation. I got the regular panel done, everything came back negative a week later, and I figured it would just resolve on its own. However, around January 9th or so, I had tingles in my outer labia and irritation/itch/pain around my vaginal opening. I went to see a doctor at my university clinic, he said nothing looked unusual, and he ordered the standard STI tests, along with an IgG test for herpes, and swabs for yeast and mycoplasma. Everything came back negative again. I contacted my most recent partner, and he got the standard panel and an IgG for herpes, and says everything was negative. \n\nAs time goes on, my symptoms expand to aching skin in my genital region, itchy skin all over my groin area (butt cheeks, mons pubis, anus, etc.), consistent tingles in my outer labia, aching legs and sometimes arms (all the way does to my toes, feels like the inside of my limbs are burning). In April, a lump appeared in my groin that may or may not be a swollen lymph node and that hasn't gone away since (going on 4 months with that now, yay). There also appear to be tiny, tiny skin coloured bumps near my urethral opening that are pretty much always there as far as I can tell. And I'm tired a lot of the time. Sometimes the best way I can describe what I'm feeling is it feels like my entire lower body has the flu, plus also weird tingles and itches.\n\nI've been tested for herpes with an IgG test 3 times - 4 weeks post exposure, 13 weeks, and 17 weeks. All negative. I decided to get a Western Blot done because I was losing my mind, and had to go to Seattle to get it since the test isn't available in Canada. This was also negative, so between 3 negative IgGs, a negative Western Blot at over 6 months post exposure, and my \"partner's\" negative IgG, I'm pretty much 100% sure I don't have herpes... not to mention I haven't had any blisters, every doctor I've seen said it doesn't look like herpes, and I don't have any patterns resembling \"outbreaks\" - my symptoms basically just come and go at random. \n\nI'm wondering if it's a bizarre allergy, or something autoimmune, or one friend suggested I get tested for lyme disease? I'm honestly at my wits' end. I've seen 5 doctors and 3 sexual health nurses and no one has tested me for anything except STIs and yeast infections, even when I tried to get them to test for more outside the box things. I'm really at the end of my rope here - depressed, feeling like I can't live a normal life, like I'll never have a relationship again, and like no one cares about what's happening to me.\n\nHas anyone ever encountered anything like this? I really need answers. Please."

I deal with the flu and cold like any hard, badass dude would - crying and snotting into 8 boxes of tissues while I bitch to my gf about how miserable I am. \n\nSo exactly 11 days ago I went to Loch Raven Reservior (freshwater) and rented a boat for my birthday. It was extremely hot and after a few hours on the water it was either anchor up on the shoreline and cool off in the water or let the sun murder me.\n\nAbout 15 minutes back in the boat I pulled my shoe off as my right foot was in a good deal of pain. My foot was red and a little swollen but most of the pain was coming from 2 blisters that appeared on my toes. A few days go by and the swelling goes down. But the blisters have popped and are oozing pus through bandaids every 20 minutes. \n\nOver the next 5 days, I do my best to keep the sores clean and dry. But they spread to my left foot and up both my legs, beginning as blisters and eventually popping and refusing to \"crust up\" and heal. Some worse than others and growing in size. Just soaking through bandaids. I also begin experiencing soreness/tenderness in my lower back.\n\nCome the 5th, I decide against cancelling the vacation we planned and head out for a camping trip. On the car drive there, my back pain jumped up to a 10, I had some sharp pain stomach cramps, and I felt extremely dizzy. Almost blacked out inside the restroom of a Royal Farms. After a few hours, the dizziness and cramps subsided but the back pain remained and I had diarrhea for 3 days. \n\nAfter 3 days of 5 to 10 back pain and constant diarrhea I cut the vacation short to come home and visit my PCP. I waited 2 hours from the time of my appointment only to be told \"You picked something up. You're young. You'll bounce back\". By this time, my first 2 sores are beginning to heal. But more pop up every day and others are getting bigger. Not to mention the back pain that fluctuates between a 5 and a 10 every 8 hours. Feeling I needed a 2nd opinion I went to Urgent Care the same day. \n\nAt Urgent Care, my urinalysis came back ok, so I was told I wouldn't be given anything, but that the back pain was concerning and could be kidneys so I would need to go to the ER for blood work. Frustrated, I decided it was best to just nip it and go. So after a wait there, blood was drawn and tests came back clean.\n\nSo here I am, back at a 6 or 7, feet and legs oozing pus at uncontrollable rates, being told \"you know what this reminds me of?

I hadn\u2019t eaten all day, but sipped occasionally from a water bottle (not unusual). I finally ate half a Philly cheesesteak at about 3pm and then continued doing more work at home. Suddenly, in the middle of it, I began to feel strangely and needed to lie down. (This happens a few times a year.) I lay down for about 20 minutes and then I\u2019m fine. After resting, I started to work again, just trying to take it easy. A few hours later, I decide to go to bed for the night. I slept for about three hours. After a few minutes of laying on my bed, I sat up. Within 30 seconds, I felt like I was going to be sick. I immediately laid down flat on my back. It helped, but I was shaking violently, felt very cold and my heart rate was about 130 bpm. (My normal is around 78bpm) I laid there for about 40 minutes with my fan blowing full blast on my body until I stopped shaking and my heart rate slowed. If it matters, the top half of my body stopped shaking after about ten minutes. Then my legs stopped shaking about five minutes later. I slowly worked my way to sitting fully upright and felt ok. About an hour later, I sudden got cold flash and felt like I needed to lay down again. I stood up to go to my room and felt somewhat better right away. I\u2019m now sitting up on my bed trying to force myself to eat club crackers and sipping water with my fan blowing on me. My head feels somewhat warm, but I don\u2019t have a fever. I\u2019m still having very mild cold flashes that last a few seconds, but otherwise feel ok. \n\nAdditionally, for the past few days I have had: \n\n-Very mild tension and sinus headaches. Like, my head just throbs slightly for about a minute, and then I\u2019m fine. \n\n-Almost no appetite or desire to eat when I am actually hungry. I\u2019ve been eating about one medium sized meal a day, usually in the late afternoon or early evening. \n\n-Particularly bad sleep. I\u2019ve been sleeping in 2-5 hour increments and have been experiencing noticeable fatigue over the last 6-8 months. \n\n-Trouble breathing when laying down. Not gasping for air, but like I\u2019m not getting enough oxygen. It lasts for a few minutes and then goes away. I do not smoke, nor am I around those who do. \n\nAny ideas?"

One of them is waking up with phlegm every morning and the other is sleepiness. My observation so far in my life is that my post-nasal drip intensity correlates with the air quality. My previous house was a clean new building and I almost didn't have any phlegm problems; woke up clean. In the house before that I had smoking roommates. I caught later that they were sometimes smoking indoors and I had extreme phlegm problems. \n\nMy new apartment is actually quite an old building and I live on the first floor. When I first moved in, the house didn't smell good and had humidity issues. I run a dehumidifier at home half the day now so it probably helps with the humidity. The odd smell is less intense but is still there. I am wondering if there are certain particulates in the air that I react badly to / decreases my breathing quality. However, I don't know how to test for it or what particulate to begin with. My quality of breathing is overall not great because of a deviated septum and a soft tissue growth inside the one that's already narrow due to the deviated septum. But it seems to be worse here (both before and after I started running the   \n dehumidifier) and I think I just need pointers to start to figure out what the cause is.\n\nAs for sleepiness, I usually sleep 7 hours a day (maximum 8) and wake up feeling energetic.

Feeling like shit for almost 3 years and unable to find answers or a doctor who cares. \n\nThis has been going on for almost 3 years, having chronic unexplained health issues and my PCP has seemingly washed their hands of me after Year 1. When this first started she ordered me a CT scan (negative other than slightly enlarged lymph nodes in mesentric root and 4 mm incidental lung nodules), blood work (normal), and colonoscopy (normal). I also wore a holter monitor for 24 hours which showed tachycardia and bradycardia, but no follow up on that. My main symptoms are low grade fevers every day, feeling fatigued and generally unwell, and left side mid to low back pain. I was convinced that I had a kidney infection or something bc the pain is deep and aching and feels like an organ not muscular, but scans and blood show my kidneys are fine. \nI pretty much gave up on going to the doctor after that first year bc they couldn\u2019t find anything and the implication was that I\u2019m just crazy or anxious. I tried to just deal with it for over a year but recently went back bc it is really fucking up my life. I\u2019m a mom and I feel like life is passing me by and I am missing out on so much feeling sick all the time. My energy levels, memory, and focus are shot as well. My doctor didn\u2019t order any additional tests and I feel like she just wants me to go away. She made a comment that my heart rate has always been high during visits (it was 137 bpm last time), but that it could just be a reaction to having a fever (temp was 99.3). So I bought one of those finger things to see what it is at home. I wake up every morning feeling really weak and sluggish and with a dull pain on my left side right below my heart. I took a pulse reading a few minutes after getting up, sitting on the couch and it was 84 %SpO2 and 81 bpm. About ten minutes later it was 91 %SpO2 and 113 bpm. After about 30 minutes, my oxygen levels seemed to normalize back up to the 95% range. Throughout the day my heart is regularly above 100 bpm. Could this give any indication of what has been wrong with me and is it worth seeing a doctor over? I feel like I need a new PCP which will probably take months to get in with and I feel hopeless as far as finding actual medical answers and help. \n\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/65zMq0M"

I've done many tests, tried all sorts of medications (antidepressants, antipsychotics, anti-epileptics,..) and seen many doctors (mainly neurologists), but so far a diagnosis could not be made. The doctors have no idea what's wrong with me and we arrived at a point where they tell me \"you'll have to learn to live with it\".\n\nWhen the systoms started, I had been taking alprazolam sporadically (about 3-4 times per week) as I had these prescribed for a severe depression I had years before. I was still taking this medicine to calm down myself at times I felt it was needed.\n\nAt a certain point (around 2 years ago when the problems started), I found out alprazolam relieves my symptoms temporarily. I started taking it daily. Until this day, I have been taking 0.5mg-1mg alprazolam (xanax) on a daily basis. The doctors I've seen are not really in favor of it, but generally tell me they don't mind if this is the only thing that helps me getting through the day, as long as I don't start taking more because of tolerance. Although I have some tolerance against alprazolam, I can still feel it and it still gives me some relief. Because the psychiatrist suspected it might be a neurological problem, he switched me to clonazepam (0.5-1mg per day) a few months ago. Honestly, I feel no difference between clonazepam and alprazolam, so I've continued taking this.\n\nI would like to stop taking benzo's. I have been thinking (parts of) my symptoms are actually withdrawal symtoms and I managed to live without benzo's on a daily basis before. I've discussed this with my psychiatrist and he told me it's up to me. I discussed a tapering method, but he said it's complete nonsense to taper off if all I'm taking is 0.5-1mg alprazolam/clonazepam per day.\n\nSo I've tried what he said and stopped cold turkey. He's what happened:\n\n* Day 1: hard to concentrate, symptoms getting worse through the day. No relief from clonazepam this time. Falling asleep was hard, but I managed.\n* Day 2: Symptoms much more severe, craving for clonazepam. I managed, but falling asleep wasn't possible anymore. I literally didn't sleep for a single minute.\n* Day 3: Very tired, but still not possible to fall asleep even though I've been awake for over 24 hours. Symptoms less severe, but likely because of the tiredness. Muscle spasms starting to appear which only got worse over the day, flu-like symptoms appear. Again not being able to sleep: second night with no sleep.\n* Day 4: I've been awake for 48 hours now without sleep. Very very tired, but no matter how much I try, falling asleep isn't possible. My body feels tired, but my brains feels like it's still active. I feel very ill now, needed to puke as well. I see things moving, even though I know it's not real. I think I'm starting to hallucinate, never before I experienced something like this.\n\nAt this point, I gave up. I took 1mg clonazepam and 30 minutes later I fell asleep for a long time. After I woke up, the flu-like symtoms were gone. Everything was back to normal.\n\nWell, that's it for \"tapering isn't needed\". Honestly, I don't feel very comfortable with this psychiatrist, but I'm not able to find another one. I've done a lot of calls for an appointment outside business hours and the first available slot is Q4 2020 (not a typo). When I dropped my \"outside business hours\" demand, the first possible appointment became Q1 2020. I've actually waited this long to see a psychiatrist for a second opinion a few months ago and this second psychiatrist didn't even let me explain why I was there: he told me I belong in a mental institution (right at the start of the conversation, without ever seeing me) and shouldn't be seeking other therapists. He told me to return to the other psychiatrist and when I explained I waited half a year for this appointment to get another opinion, he literally said \"I just told you my opinion: Get yourself hospitalised inside a psychiatrist ward. I refuse to discuss this any further with you. Now get out.\" The guy was a real douchebag. The reason I can get faster appointments with the my regular psychiatrist is because he limits his appointments to 20 minutes (constantly looking at the clock) and charges about 4 times the normal rate.\n\nI feel stuck and I want to taper off benzo's, but the only psychiatrist I can see tells me tapering isn't needed and I'm overreacting when I explain the withrawal. I've seen some neurologists as well, but that was only for the medical tests, so these were 1-time appointments. The normal family doctor I see here (like a GP in the UK) tries to help me as much as she can, but also honestly tells me she doens't have any knowledge about benzo's and withdrawal and I need to see a psychiatrist for that. I asked if I could switch to diazepam (valium) and taper off slowly as this is recommended everywhere, but she doesn't really feel comfortable doing this just because I \"read it on the internet\".\n\nWherever I go, the Ashton manual is recommended, which basically says switching to diazepam and taper off 1mg every 1-2 weeks. However, I cannot find the reliability of this manual. I'd like to discuss this manual with my family doctor to convince her giving me a tapering plan, but before I do, I want to make sure this manual is actually a reliable source of info. Also, I'd like to know if such severe withdrawal is normal.\n\n**TL;DR**: Taking 0.5-1mg clonazepam daily for vague mental issue complaints. Tapering off is bullshit according to my therapist because I take a low amount. Extreme withdrawal starts when I quit cold turkey. I'm unable to see another therapist for now. I wonder if the Ashton manual is really a reliable source of info and would like to know is it's normal that I go into withdrawal for quiting clonazepam when taking such a low amount."

Thanks!**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor the past few years now, I have had issues whenever I go into a shower, a hot environment or whenever I exercise vigorously, I get a sensation of pins sticking into my body and then a hard itch comes on, this normally happens for five to ten minutes, goes away for around twenty minutes, and then happens again. It is not debilitating to the point where I don't want to wash myself off, however whenever it happens it's enough for me to wince and stop what I am doing in order for it to stop. I have also had issues with my hands, feet, and joints becoming extremely cold. I play piano on a regular basis so whenever this happens it really drags down my abilities and frustrates me to the point where I can't have to do something else for a while and then return.\n\n  \nWhenever I stand up after sitting down for 30 minutes, I typically have some sort of lightheadedness and some sort of visual disturbance, whether it be something as simple as seeing little fuzzies on my peripheral vision to a full on blackout, causing me to sit back down and try again. I am aware that this could be caused by dehydration, however, I have been drinking enough water (around 3/4 gallon) and I still get this problem.  \n\n\nI have also been extremely fatigued for the last few months, despite my anxiety trying to kick me in high gear. It's almost like I have separated myself from work that I was doing at the start of the year in favor of just kicking back and relaxing. I have never been this type of person to not be the high-strung, get-er-done personality and this rapid shift because of my malaise is really starting to get to me.\n\n  \nAnother thing that I am not sure is necessarily relevant is that I have been having more frequent nosebleeds. These happen everywhere, in the shower, while driving, playing music.. it goes on. These episodes don't happen too often as far as days go but when one of those days hit, I would have around 4-6 good sized nosebleeds. It's not debilitating either, but it is sure annoying.  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBecause of all of this, on 2/12/2019 I went to have some lab tests done, I had a CMP, CBC, iron study (w/o ferritin), Lyme, TSH and urine sample done. Those values not listed below came normal. \n\nSerum iron: 192 (high)\n\nTIBC: 310 (regular)\n\nUIBC: 182 (low)\n\nIron Sat. %: 62 (high)\n\nRBC: 5.80 mil/uL (upper reference bound)\n\nHemoglobin: 17.6 g/dL (upper high)\n\nHematocrit: 51.4% (high)\n\nVitamin D: 22.4 ng/mL (low)\n\nBUN/Creatinine ratio: 8 (low)\n\n  \nAn EKG that was also ran due to my father having Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome came back normal.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did not get these test results until mid-May, except for the doctor calling me about the vitamin D deficiency, which was corrected with supplementation. The symptoms above continued, the fatigue became more and more apparent to those around me and I had to see my high school's mental health counselor to try to help me put my life back on track. My grades were going down significantly. \n\n  \nWhen I saw these results, I figured that something was wrong with my iron due to it being high and after my father consulted with a hematologist at the hospital he works at, he agreed.\n\nOn 7/13/2019, I got a CBC, CMP, and an iron study (with ferittin) done. All results not shown were within range.  \n\n\nSerum iron: 149 (normal)\n\nTIBC: 330 (normal)\n\nUIBC: 181 (normal)\n\nIron Sat %: 45 (normal)\n\nFerritin: 90 ng/ml (normal)\n\nRBC: 5.99mil/uL (high)\n\nHemoglobin: 17.9 g/dL (high)\n\nHematocrit: 54.3% (high)\n\nVitamin D: 38.9 ng/mL (normal)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was very confused about how all of this iron mystically disappeared. Sure, I have been having these nosebleeds but I wouldn't figure that they would cause this much iron to go away. I didn't know necessarily how I felt after this psychologically, other than really confused. I started to think I had polycythemia vera due to the symptoms above and the lab results, but it doesn't happen in pediatric patients. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn 8/2/2019, I was at band camp playing a game where the whole band stands at attention while the instructors and the people that got out try to make them break attention. I have played this game for my past 3 years there and won once, so I thought I had a legitimate shot at winning. People started to trickle off because they broke and here I was with 10 other people out standing as still as a rock. I suddenly start to have this feeling of anxiety and dread, while the pins and itches from earlier are killing me. I start to hyperventilate and I have to be forced off the field.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't remember what happened after I got pulled off the field until 2 hours afterward but from what I heard, I got gripped my friends' hands very hard that came to sit by me. My face was beet red and my skin was clammy. They said that they immediately treated me for heat exhaustion (Gatorade, cold wet rags). Whenever I tried to get up for the first time,  I had to sit back down because I couldn't see I saw stuff in my periphery whenever I could stand up and walk for some period of time. The sky, which was blue, appeared grey to me. I couldn't speak well at all until 4 hours afterwards.e\n\n  \nAfter this incident, there was conveniently a checkup a few days afterward so I wrote it all down and expressed my concerns about everything happening. I told him that I was concerned I had polycythemia vera and wanted a few tests ran. He told me, \"I have never had a patient concerned about that, but sure, why not\" and gave me the orders for the tests.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA CBC, CMP, reticulocyte count and EPO test were ran on 8/5/2019.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRBC: 5.59 mil/mL (normal)\n\nHemoglobin: 17.1 g/dL (normal)\n\nHematocrit: 50.1% (normal)\n\nEPO: 9.8 mIU/mL (normal)\n\nReticulocyte %: 1.5 (normal)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am just confused about how my red blood cell stats, which have displayed an upward trend have went down this much over 2 weeks. I have had no nosebleeds to remove any red blood cells and if anything I should have more because I was basically being force-fed red meat.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nQuestion: **How did my test results go down the way they did?**\n\n**Is there something wrong?**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSymptoms:\n\nPricking of skin and then itching during shower, hot environment or exercise.\n\nCold hands, feet and joints\n\nEpisodic frequent nosebleeds\n\nFatigue\n\nAggravation of anxiety\n\nWeirdness when standing (orthostatic hypotension?)\n\nFull-on black-out on 8/2/19"

More blood came out than I thought should from a little dot like this. I was outside so I just let the blood dry up and when I went inside later I cleaned it up and it started bleeding again for a minute, but then stopped, and now it looks like the image I posted below. I guess it scabbed over when I noticed it the first time? I don't remember ever seeing that the day before when I was putting my socks on after my shower, or maybe I just didn't look hard enough. But now my hypochondriac mind is thinking it's a bat bite or a tick or something. It doesn't hurt or itch, but I think my anxiety is playing up and making me believe I have rabies now. I live near woods but haven't seen any bats and I'm pretty sure there are no bats in my house. But now I can't stop thinking I got bit by a bat or something. Does it look like a bite?

Located in New Brunswick, Canada.\n\nOkay. So I've been bitching about my symptoms allll week, I apologize if anyone's tired of hearing from me about this. I went on two meds (fluoxetine 10mg &amp; concerta 18mg) on July 18th, had 10 doses fluox, 7 doses of concerta, then went up to fluox @ 20mg and concerta @ 27mg. I had a TERRIBLE reaction (panic attacks and bad physical complications including jittery vision, blurred vision, peeing constantly, shaking fiercely, racing, pounding heartbeat, etc) 4 days &amp; 4 doses later, went to the hospital (they said I was fine) and quit them both cold turkey as I didn't know which the culprit was and did NOT want to screw around with them further (psychiatrist did give me his go-ahead to do so, saying withdrawal shouldn't be that bad). In fact, I've been quite sick since last sunday (it's been 6 days since I stopped taking meds). I'm still battling mild bloating, constipation and diarrhea, weakness, blurred vision, mild shakiness, fogginess, fatigue, mild achiness, the odd chest-pains (could be that I'm sleeping on the couch), mild shortness of breath (not sure why? can weakness make you short of breath?), and dizziness &amp; lightheadedness, which are probably the worst symptoms I'm having right now.\n\nMy questions are:\n\n1: Really? I'm STILL sick? Is this to be expected on Fluoxetine (keep reading that withdrawal symptoms shouldn't be so bad due to its half-life) after such a short treatment? Is it because I had such a bad reaction? I'm assuming I'm just sensitive to serotonin.\n\n2: I'm so eager to get over this and I'm partly wondering if my blood sugar's just low due to the low appetite during my treatment (I've barely been eating apart from bland foods)? If anyone feels it's okay, are there things I can do to start getting back to normal? I'm struggling to eat but getting an appetite, and I want to get back out there walking and exercising but I'm soo dizzy still :c Getting up and trying to force myself to stay up makes it worse and increases fatigue.\n\nI'm going crazy. I just want to get over this. Feeling like it's never gonna end is making me feel like I'm constantly fighting off panic attacks.\n\nAny advice would be SUPER appreciated!"

I used mostly the same lab, but we used two different labs (one mid July and one on 8/5/19) to see if the lab I was using was messing up the test. \n\n3/25/19\n\n*  TSH: 0.30 (normal 0.27-4.2)\n\n6/5/19 \n\n* TSH 5.13 (normal 0.27-4.2), \n* Free T4 1.9 (normal 0.8-1.7)\n\n6/29/19 \n\n* TSH 4.32 (normal 0.27-4.2), \n* Free T4 2.9 (normal 0.8-1.7), \n* thyroid peroxidase AB 125 (normal &lt;34U/mL)\n\nMid July pattern: \n\n* TSH high, \n* free T4 normal, \n* free T3 high\n\n7/23/19 \n\n* TSH 3.19 (normal 0.27-4.2), \n* Free T4 2.4 (normal 0.8-1.7), \n* Free T3 5.22 (normal 2.57-4.43), \n* Thyroid Stimulating Immunoglobulin &lt;1.0 (normal &lt;1.3)\n\n8/05/19 \n\n* TSH 6.9 (normal 0.4-4.5),\n*  Free T4 1.1 (normal 0.8-1.8), \n* Free T3 2.4 (normal 2.3-4.2), \n* TSI &lt;89 (normal &lt;140)\n\nIn general my other blood tests are normal with the exception that my ANA is positive (1:640) but without any of the other autoimmune markers coming back positive and a very mildly elevated CRP (it was 0.9 and normal is &lt;0.5). I also had a high Prolactin at one point (a little less than a year ago), but that has since slowly drifted back into the normal range and is normal now. \n\nBasically, my endocrinologist is very confused by these results. I don't think she has seen the latest results yet though. The latest test (done at a new lab) seem to be the most normally abnormal and points towards subclinical hypothyroidism... but with how much variance there has been between labwork (even done at the same lab) I am less inclined to believe the snapshot we got is actually representative of what is going on. How do you treat thyroid problems that do not seem to follow a pattern?\n\nAlso, I am very careful to not take the levothyroxine with any sort of calcium and and I take it at bed time appx 3 hours after eating. In addition there has not been a change in my levothyroxine manufacturer in the past 6-8months. \n\nI have had no energy, but have also been really shaky. At times my heart rate is high, but that could be related to my POTS. I have been dealing with lightheadedness and low blood pressures, but again that could be POTS/dysautonomia. I have had a massive amount of weight gain, but that could be related to going off Topiramate and being less active due to my symptoms. I have so many confounding variables that it is difficult to adjust based on symptoms alone. \n\nBasically, does anyone have any ideas on how to figure out what is actually going on and to treat it? Has anyone seen such variable thyroid test results? results that do not seem to follow the \"normal\" abnormal results?"

I know this is a hard to treat syndrome so I don't expect perfect answers. I just wanted to hear other opinions. Foods I could eat a few years ago I seemingly can't now. I have a few questions that I would appreciate if someone more knowledgeable than me could answer:\n\n1. Symptom timing: If you eat a trigger food would it trigger diarrhea and cramping within 30 minutes like usual or is it possible that it would bother you a day or two later? I asked my doctor this and he said it would both you the same day. I don't quite understand how this works because the food you ate 30 minutes earlier (I think) has not yet reached your colon. \n\n2. Using immodium preventitavely: I currently take immodium but only after I've had diarrhea or if I'm going to go for a long period without a bathroom (as my doctor recommended) . I currently have painful cramping and diarrhea at least once per week if not twice or three times at worst. Is there any way I can use immodium more preventatively so I can avoid the cramping and diarrhea without getting constipated? I avoid trigger foods that I know of and I eat slowly and small portions. I also try to manage my anxiety about it as best as possible and meditate. Sometimes, however, I really don't know what causes the cramps and diarrhea because it could happen when I eat something that didn't bother me before.\n\n3. Cramping pain reduction:  I've tried a myriad of things including peppermint pills, dicyclomine, and probiotics. Though, when I took dicyclomine I only used it after I had diarrhea. Recently I've seen large amounts of (non doctor) talk about CBD and THC but upon looking, there seems to be a lack of studies that suggest huge benefits for IBS. Lately I'm most concerned with pain reduction because if it was just diarrhea once per week without the bad cramps it'd make things easier to manage. In this regard, I have considered using a THC vape if cramps start to come on. I could also try to use dicyclomine preventitavely.\n\n4. Research: I want to stay informed about advancements in ibs/gut research. Is there any academic journal I can follow that people here may know of? \n\nIf it was a perfect world I'd prefer to have something that prevents cramping and diarrhea (perhaps regular immodium?) and something that reduces cramping if it still comes (perhaps THC, CBD, or dicyclomine). Can anyone speak to the treatments I've mentioned? Thank you for your help!\n\nEdit: I've also heard of psyllium husk for regulating bowel movements but have not tried it."

My mom used to joke how I was \u201cthe odd one\u201d of all my siblings. I was always extremely clumsy and \u201cungraceful\u201d as my family would put it. \n\nI had \u201cticks\u201d when I was about 8-12yo where I would push my lips out and blow warm air from my nose, and I would also furrow my eyebrows because I liked the feeling of my eyebrows brushing over my glasses rims. Until I was about 13yo I had a frequent impulse to make a loud sound (usually just a throat sound) when things were \u201ctoo quiet\u201d. Since about 15 I\u2019ve done this strange flexation (?) if my throat muscles impulsively, I don\u2019t usually realize I am doing it. But it is very obvious and I tend to do it in moments of tension or concentration. \n\nI\u2019ve played piano since I was 6 years old. I still do this \u201cthing\u201d where I press my fingers against different surfaces (not a piano) as if I am playing a song on a piano. I will \u201cplay the song\u201d over and over until it \u201cfeels\u201d right. I have to have a specific pressure and position of each \u201cnote/finger\u201d or I have to start over. This happens mostly every night when I am trying to fall asleep, but happens other times too. Sometimes it\u2019s not even \u201cpiano playing\u201d but I just need to press and feel certain pressures.\n\nI never had issues making friends or getting along with other children. I have never had problems reading emotions or reading social situations. However, as the year passed I\u2019ve become more and more fearful of social interaction (especially in a small group setting). Any sort of social interaction requires me to kind of \u201ctalk myself up\u201d in order to encourage myself to take part. I sometimes have anxiety attacks before social events. I\u2019m often told that I was very charming and appear very comfortable in social situations. No one really knows that every single moment of social situations I am trying very hard to be what I feel is \u201cnormal\u201d. I often worry if people thing I\u2019m strange or can tell that I\u2019m trying hard to be normal. Social interaction exhausts me and I\u2019ve often used alcohol as a crutch for these situations. \n\nMy entire life I have been very uncomfortable with certain textures. Velvet for example, I have an extremely difficult time touching or running my hands over. I\u2019ve been able to tolerate more over the years but I still cannot handle some textures, they make me feel genuine panic if I\u2019m forced to touch them and my fingers feel tingly. The sound of fingers sliding over guitar strings makes me extremely extremely anxious and uncomfortable to the point of tears. My friends used to pick on my and rub guitar strings just to watch my reaction.\n\nSometimes, but not always, extremely loud noises cause my heart to race and me to feel panic. For example, the subway or in movie theaters.\n\nI\u2019m extremely anal about the esthetic of my apartment. Not even necessarily the cleanliness (though I do keep it clean), but I feel the strong desire that everything has to be in its PERFECT place. I will rearrange my plants (for example) over and over and over until the placement \u201cfeels\u201d right. I also have my bookshelves organized in rainbow order, and feel upset and anxious if anyone\u2019s moves them.\n\nI\u2019ve had panic and anxiety attacks since I was 14. I\u2019ve had BDD and an eating disorder since I was 18. \n\nI feel like there is probably more I could mention, but these are the things that stand out most. I suppose at this point it doesn\u2019t really matter technically if I am on the spectrum or not. I\u2019m married with a child and pretty happy most of the time. I guess it would just feel good to have a name or reason for all of these things that I do and feel. Could I have a form or degree of autism?\n\nEdit: I am white. Also, when I was a child my mom had taken me to the doctors regarding these \u201cticks\u201d, and after my first grade teacher contacted her and was concerned I may have some form of ADD or autism. My pediatrician apparently said, \u201c she\u2019s a special girl\u201d and \u201cnot to worry about it, she will grow out of this\u201d or something like that, but never said anything about a diagnosis."

However, when i \u201ctest\u201d myself and run up the stairs and skip rope i.e. try to exert myself, the pressure is relieved sometimes, but not all the time, by belching. Is this pain gerd or could still be cardiac? \n\nA few days ago i might have had food poisoning because i felt nauseous, lost my appetite and didn\u2019t enjoy cannibis anymore. I also felt heartburn especially when my stomach was empty, and indigestion after eating. I thought all pointed to a heart attack, so to prove myself wrong i ran on the treadmill for 15 minutes, covering 1.4 miles. Nothing too bad, but i had mild heartburn after. \n\nSometimes i feel like it got harder for me to breathe too. Not sure if anxiety?\n\nThe thing is, sometimes the pain from the heartburn goes away, and gets replaced with a tight muscle- sort of feeling on my left chest. \n\nAlso, there has been this mild but sharp shooting pain that throbs down my left arm, and sometimes i feel tightness in my neck too. My left wrist recently bumped into a sharp table corner, and was bruised. Also, i notice very very small purple webs, but they are more like 2 or 3 threads, on my left arm. Nothing major loke in the webmd symptoms, but not sure what it signifies. \n\nOverall, I\u2019m not sure if this is from running 2 miles after a period of not running, or from skipping rope, or actually all are related to a cardiac event. \n\nI might be overly paranoid because upon exertion most of the time the symptoms disappear, but also sometimes the heartburn shows up after exercise. \n\nBTW, i had a 12-lead EKG about two months ago, and a chest x-ray from the ER, but no blood test because i didn\u2019t want to face the needle unless i absolutely have to. The doctor said despite me thinking i had a heart attack it was anxiety and my ekg was normal. But i also read that the ekg results can be misleading, and that only troponin levels is foolproof."

I had the left done July 10, and the right done July 17. The left was magical. No issues whatsoever and the incision is well healed now. \nThe right, my surgeon commented that it was a far more difficult surgery, as the tunnel was far tighter and he really had to fight to do the release saying the instruments were almost too big. Ouch. \n48 hours later, I take off my bandages. Looks good but very different from my left side at the same milestone. Both are the first two pictures included for comparison. \n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/WhavCQT\n\nThe entire time I am caring for this incision (polysporin always and bandaids if I leave the house), I notice it is extremely different from the left. I notice it is still draining clear yellow fluids past what I consider normal. So on Thursday, July 25, I call my surgeons office. I describe what the appearance is in detail over the phone. I\u2019m told the surgeon is on vacation but it doesn\u2019t sound like I have an infection, it sounds as if it\u2019s just healing slower than my left did and that\u2019s typical. She said if I notice any opaque yellow drainage, redness that starts to spread outwards, bleeding, or fever, chills, etc. to go to my family doctor. She tells me to continue with polysporin and using bandaids when I leave the house, which was the surgeons instructions post surgery as well. \n\nOn Saturday I wake up and I wash my hands, and notice the lateral sutures are missing. They must have fallen down the drain without me noticing. I call again and am told since there\u2019s no blood and it doesn\u2019t really look like the incision is open (just the weird top layer of skin that is white) that it should heal okay from here. \n\nOn Sunday night, I can\u2019t sleep. I have major chills but no fever. I KNOW something is wrong. The entire incision and surrounding area is incredibly itchy and slightly painful. Not major but more than it has been. \n\nMonday morning I get up to pee after sleeping 2 hours, and I notice a small pea sized ball of pus at the base of the incision, and that the top layer of skin has split a bit more. The redness has spread outwards as well. I wipe away the tiny bit of pus, and a similar size drop of fresh blood comes out. I\u2019m gone. To Urgent Care I go, since my family Doctor is on vacation too! \n\nThe physician hmmms and haws and asks where the sutures went. I don\u2019t know. He says there might be an infection preventing proper healing. He notes I don\u2019t have a fever, the surrounding area isn\u2019t hot, but it\u2019s very red and obviously there\u2019s a healing issue as it\u2019s 12 days post op and it should be time for the sutures to come out and it\u2019s in no way ready. He sends me home with a 7 day course of cephalexin. 500mg tablet QID.

I told her I've had a hemorrhoid since I was 16 (never actually diagnosed at the time, but it doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure this one out). Then got it checked and confirmed that it was a hemorrhoid. Went to my primary care doctor and he said not to worry and to increase my water and fiber intake. He said as long as it's not a constant thing and other than small amounts of blood it's a normal bowel movement not to worry. So for the past two months I've been freaking out and checking every time I go to the bathroom. Sometimes there's small amounts of blood here and there, but generally not and everything else seems normal. \n\nNow for the last two weeks I've felt as though my stomach is agitated. I can't say it's in a specific region, mostly everywhere. But, if I had to choose a region it was most annoying, I'd say it's in the upper abdomen. Naturally, again, I get super bad anxiety related to my health and start googling everything it could be and telling myself I have this or that disease. I really just want to know what I should be doing or what I should tell my doctor. These things could be totally unrelated, but both of them concern me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSome answers to some questions I could foresee: \n\n1. No, cancer doesn't run in my family. I think the only person who had cancer in my family was my grandmother and she smoked like a chimney and had lung cancer.\n2. The past week I've got fiber supplements and have only drank water/milk. Bowel movements seem fine to me. They're mostly green though, and idk if that is important or not.\n3. I can't really describe how my stomach feels. It's just...uncomfortable. Not painful, I'd say, but maybe it feels like there's some pressure or something on it. \n4. I'm generally an active person - did sports in high school and college and love going to the gym (though I've slacked off the last month due to moving to a new state and starting a new job)\n5. I used to drink a lot in college, especially senior year, but starting this past May I've cut down on drinking significantly. I've probably had a total of 10 beers the past month and 4 of them were in one day. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know this is a lot of information and I'm sorry to overload it, I'm just super concerned when it comes to my health. Thanks for the taking the time to read this and if you have any suggestions on what I should do/who I should see I'd really appreciate it."

        "reddit": "35yo mixed white-Asian male, 5'8 and 187 pounds. I posted here before, but symptoms have continued and I've had several ER and doctor visits to no avail.\n\nThe symptoms I'm having appear to be heart-related in that I've experienced some chest and left arm discomfort, fatigue, and dizziness. My family has a history of heart disease, and I have high cholesterol (233 total, 167 LDL, 46 HDL, 98 triglycerides). I have had asymptomatic sinus bradycardia since I was a kid. HR is typically about 40-50 bpm at rest, 37 while asleep. Also diagnosed with mild sleep apnea for which I am not using an appliance.\n\nIn March, I had symptoms that took me into the emergency room. Heart was skipping beats every few seconds and after a and I was told to taper off caffeine, as I was having between 2 and 8 Coke Zeros a day.\n\nI tapered off but then picked back up again. In May, I went to urgent care because--after a highly caffeinated day--I had a very big skipped beat that felt like it knocked the wind out of me. Friends saw and they took me in. This time, nothing showed on the ECG.\n\nAfter another such attack four weeks ago, I quit diet soda and talked to my PCP. He said that this was all probably anxiety, but took an ECG that showed I had a long QT interval. No ECG before or since has indicated this, so we've written it off.\n\nA day after this appointment, I had a dizzy spell. Two days later, dizziness became a constant from mid-morning to evening. I told the doctor this and he noted that my sinuses has been blocked for weeks, so he put me on Augmentin to clear that up, and Flonase to help. It has been three days and I do feel less dizzy.\n\nNow, the tough part. I have been to the ER three times in the last week and a half. The first was because the dizziness grew into extreme nausea, chest discomfort, and headache. They took an ECG and troponin, which were fine. And they sent me home.\n\nSecond visit was because I grew lightheaded and almost passed out while hanging out with friends. Normal ECG and troponin, sent home.\n\nToday, I had an appointment with my cardiologist. I was at work before the appt and suddenly felt incredibly tired--the worst fatigue I have ever felt. I forced myself to walk around, but my body felt (and still feels) heavy and my chest felt like there was a lot of pressure. I keep coughing for no reason. Even now, my head feels tight and foggy. On the way to the ER, my heart rate abruptly hit 130 before falling back down to a normal 50ish.\n\nAgain, ER checked my ECG and troponin, and sent me on to my cardiologist.  He, too, took an ECG, and said there was nothing to worry about.\n\nHe says I'm fine and this is just anxiety. I have no history of anxiety, but my body feels incredibly crappy right now. \n\nNo indicators on any blood tests, except that I have slightly low vitamin D and high cholesterol.\n\nWhat's wrong with me? More importantly, how do I get help?"

And I was a healthy weight a year and a half ago, but now I've almost doubled my weight due to some insane binge eating. Stretch marks everywhere. That's not my main point though, but just in case if it's relevant.\n\n\nI have been diagnosed with some severe general anxiety and depression and hyperthyroidism. I am taking Quetiapine (75-150mg a night depending on how I'm doing), Sertraline (150mg/night), Lamotrigine (200mg/night), and the occasional 1mg Lorazepam. I have been on Quetiapine for years, Sertraline and Lamotrigine for almost a year. I upped my dose of Sertraline over a month ago from 100mg to 150mg. And around the same time I switched from Alysena birth control to the Mirena IUD.\n\n\nSo I've been experiencing lower abdominal pain and cramping, which is obviously the IUD. And I was nauseous for a few days, which could be the same or pretty much any other medication I'm on. I have also been very easily numb in my limbs for the past few years which my doctor and I have chalked up to my anxiety. So when I became increasingly numb and not so much tingly but more painful, I assumed it was situational anxiety (stressful time of year for me). However it has become painful for me to do things such as braid my hair, paint, or even just sit in one position for a long time. This has happened in all my limbs but most prominently my right fingers, hand, and arm, decreasing respectively.\n\n\nI am aware that this can be a symptom of the IUD, but since looking it up I have noticed a significant increase of abdominal pain and numbness. I am anxious; I am easily swayed by the power of suggestion and worry. So is this going to go away? Is it all in my head? Has my IUD mucked up my uterus? Am I diabetic? How immediately should I seek medical attention? Is it safe to take some extra Quetiapine or Lorazepam tonight so I can sleep? Should I go run to the hospital right now? Should I stop typing out questions that are only exacerbating my anxious brain? Okay I definitely know the answer to that last one.\n\n\nAny help or experience that anyone can provide would be fantastic."

I told her the gas bill I received in March for the previous 3 months was up about 30% but I assumed it was just because I was using more gas. Then 2 weeks ago I got my bill back for the previous 3 months and it had literally tripled. They had a maintenance person come out and he said that the gas leak was coming from my apartment and they finally fixed it. So I think I've finally found out what my symptoms are being caused by. I went back to my doctor and told him about it and he sent me to the hospital to get a Blood Gas Analysis this week. They came back and my doctor said he said he wasn't too familiar with the results so he sent me off to a Pulmonary specialist. So I've got a 3 week gap until I can get in and see the Pulmonary specialist. Since the leak was fixed and I've aired out my apartment 2 weeks ago I've seen slight improvements for the first time. But I didn't get the Blood gas Analyse test done until about 2 weeks after they fixed the leak.\n\nI'm certain my symptoms have to do with the gas leak and hopefully I'm just now finally recovering.

Sometimes I feel almost emotionless, I don't care about nothing and have no empathy towards anyone. And other times, I feel too much, I am scared about everything, I get panicky over petty things and I'm very paranoid. \n\n\n\nBack story - In 2012, I was 115lbs, had regular periods. In November I had the birth control Mirena put in and everything seemed fine.\n\n2015 - I stopped getting my period, but started rapidly gaining weight, got horrible acne, noticed slight abnormal hair growth on upper lip. I became very depressed and often irritable. I lost all motivation and ambition for everything and wanted nothing more to lay in bed all day.\n\nApril 2017 - Symptoms got worse. I \"thought\" I knew my problems were from the Mirena and I decided to have it removed. I thought once I got it removed, I would get better. I was wrong. I seemed like I crashed. I got even more depressed but also seemed to have anxiety at the same time. I weighed in 155lbs.\n\nSeptember 2017 - Got my first period after having Mirena removed. Cramping was so bad and the bleeding was so heavy, I felt as though I was having a miscarriage although I wasn't sexual active. I got pale and extremely lightheaded and was exhausted. Could not wear a tampon as I was bleed through them within minutes. Then I didn't have a another period for months.\n\nFebruary 2018 - Second period after having the Mirena removed. Same as last period. But started noticing other symptoms were getting worse, I was gaining more weight, acne got worse, abnormal hair growth got worse.\n\nToday - Nothing has improved. I now have a mustache that I must wax, as well as hair on chest and abdomen that I never had before. My period vary, sometimes still minutes before soaking through an ultra sized tampon and still worse than they ever were before the Mirena and still very irregular. I have gained even more weight, now 170lbs and climbing, despite eating healthy, exercising regularly, etc. I still have acne. I could still lay in bed all day and not think nothing of it, things that use to excite me no longer do.\n\nThe main reason I am here today is because I recently lost my job, due to a misunderstanding about my period. I worked for a property management company, I was maintenance/housekeeping supervisor. Two months ago, I got my first period there after working there for almost 3 months. It was horrible and I called off the first two days because the bleeding and cramping were so bad but I did go in the 3rd day, although it was still really heavy. There were complaints made by other staff members about my bathroom usage and I was accused of only going in to be on my phone, I explained to my boss that was not the case and she seemed to understand. 2 weeks later, I got my period again and it was just as bad as the last time, I went to work despite the incident last time. That day, I was told a perspective tenant wanted to look at a property almost 2 hours away and I had to get out there to clean it asap as they were scheduled to look at it in 3 hours. I said I couldn't do that because I have my period and it's really bad. I got \"Again, already\" and then the 'I think you're lying' look! That was the first time I said no about doing anything that was asked of me. They sent someone else and later that day I was called into the office and let go due to \"obsessive abuse of the break system\" due to frequent using the bathroom during non break times and inability to perform my duties.\n\nI recently started a new job and I'm terrified that the same scenario will play out again. I have explained to my boss my issues and she seems empathetic but we both know work must still get done!\n\nPlease help me figure out what is going on with me! I cannot keep living life like this and I definitely can't afford lose another job! Any help or advice will be greatly appreciated! Thank you!"

In May of 2018, I had my daughter and I started working from home, and I started smelling it again.

It\u2019s a smell only I can smell, and it goes where I go. I have high anxiety, but my husband finally convinced me to go to the doctor, and I did on Monday the 29th. They made a referral to neuro that I am still waiting on, but she did go ahead and run a slew of bloodwork to see if anything was abnormal, including a heavy metals panel, and for lead. Both of those came back as \u201cTNP\u201d citing that my blood clotted too fast and they could not use the specimen. \n\nVitamin D was deficient, but I knew it would be so I\u2019m on those supplements. What I am concerned with is my CBC and Comprehensive Metabolic Panel. There are some levels that are high, and some that teeter on the higher side but still normal range. I\u2019m currently waiting on my doctor to call me back, but if someone could take a look and tell me if they see anything concerning or anything that could be the answer for why i smell smoke, I\u2019d greatly appreciate it. \n\n[results ](https://imgur.com/a/eVx0ihC)"

Or maybe probiotics I was taking for a while contributed to this? ER doctors have urged me to go to my primary care doctor, which I have. She's not concerned and has no answers. I have GERD, IBS, acid reflux, diverticulosis, endometriosis, ovarian cysts issues, and a uterine fibroid. Has anyone else experienced mildly raised lipase levels?

During the flu-like period, I never had any genital itching or rashes but 2 months later, intense groin itching started. I tested clear for bacterial infections (including myco and ureaplasma) in the first two months and HIV (4th gen) and HSV (IgG) were still both negative at 3 months. Antifungal creams have not made a difference nor have 3 rounds of antibiotics (cipro, doxy, cephalaxin) for suspected prostate infections and 5 days of of valtrex taken during the flu-like period as a preventative outbreak measure to limit the OB if one occurred. I have never had penile discharge, foul smells, or discolored/cloudy urine.\n\nMy issues are (1) constant very mild discomfort urinating but 2 episodes of bad dysuria and (2) constant intense itching with some bouts of pin-prick-feelings in my groin for months. There is a red rash around my anus and sides of scrotum that just appeared in the last 2-3 weeks. No pain, lesions, or blisters but it is irritated and itchy.\n\nMy physicians have now basically cleared me of all STDs but can't explain what is going on. Prostate and urethra infections should have been cured with antibiotics by now and bacterial infections of urethra and prostate would not explain the itching all over the groin area, correct?\n\nCould this still be herpes given the flu-like symptoms a week after exposure, constant itching and pin-prick feelings, and the sudden onset of a rash - yet no blisters or pain? The red rashes also appeared a few days before I got the second bout of really painful dysuria but no sores are visible in the urethral opening. The dysuria is also presenting with difficulty urinating and it feels like the pain starts deep inside me and is not limited to just the burning at the opening of my urethra. The acute dysuria returns to mild after a day or two with no change in medications or diet on my part.\n\nI'm attaching some NSFW pictures of my groin near my scrotum with it pulled out of the way.  Note the red bumps at the edges and beyond in some pictures. On one side of my butt, there are also these red bumps that look and feel like pimples and nothing more but they are constantly popping up and that is unusual for me. But, I wanted to mention it.\n\nAny ideas what all of this could be? I've seen so many physicians and they are basically stumped. Can I rule out HSV via IGG after 3 months? I did take valtrex but only for a few days and it has been 3 months. I can't contact the other person (random encounter). Thank you for any opinions and advice.\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/mVeOw1I](https://imgur.com/a/mVeOw1I)"

I\u2019d also like to know more about the subject before I challenge his decision. \n\nTo investigate some symptoms I am experiencing I decided to have a blood test. The results showed a few elevated markers but I was most concerned with my prolactin. \n\nProlactin 715 mU/L (86-324) or 33.6 ng/mL\n\nFrom what I\u2019ve read online, high prolactin levels can result in low libido and decreased body mass (both of which I\u2019ve experienced). I\u2019ve also read that high prolactin could result in low dopamine and was wondering if this might explain my feelings of depression and my lack of motivation. \n\nAfter discussing the above with my GP he was completely unconcerned about the prolactin. He did question me about my low libido and depression and proceeded to prescribe 37.5mg of Venlafaxine (Effexor).\n\nMy questions are:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. Are my prolactin levels elevated enough to cause the above symptoms? \n2. What levels would be regarded as \u2018optimal\u2019 for a male?\n3. Given a patient has complained about low libido and high prolactin why would a doctor still prescribe a medication that commonly reduces libido and can, albeit rarely, raise prolactin? \n4. I\u2019ve read that prolactin and dopamine have an inverse relationship and so was wondering could that potentially mean my feelings of depression and lack of direction are stemming from low dopamine levels? If that\u2019s reasonable then I\u2019m curious why the doctor would prescribe a SNRI and not a dopamine agonist (Cabergoline) or a NDRI (Wellbutrin) - if this assumption is correct then I will be asking my GP this on my next visit. But I\u2019m all ears to any opinions/guesses.\n5. On the assumption that there should be a balance of serotonin and dopamine and that a high prolactin results in low dopamine, could a SNRI further compound my low dopamine levels?\n\nThank you for taking the time to read all of the above. I hope I provided enough information. But please do let me know if you need more.\n\nSam"

How pathetic.*\n\n*Whatever, I'm out. This sub is a joke and a massive waste of time.*\n\n*Do you have any idea what it took for me to post this? Wait, that's right. I should assume none of you read a word I wrote.*\n\n\n\n\nBefore I get called an idiot, I'd like to explain why I came here first. \n\nEver since I was young I've had that feeling that there's something wrong with my body. I know there's others out there like me. Every time I followed a potential clue it led to nothing. The doctors just do the basic tests, but don't go beyond it when those tests are negative. Which is fair. Advanced testing gets expensive pretty quick. \n\nWhen I was young I was diagnosed with some mood and anxiety disorders. I'm always the first to agree that my mind is powerful enough to create pain out of nothing. I've gotten good at telling the difference. But I find it unlikely that my mind is causing all my problems. It's just too much, and some of the symptoms are complex. \n\nStill, a lot of the time my symptoms are downplayed or even just written off as nothing. My age also works against me. I keep getting told that I'm too young to be sick. But my family history and the experiences of others confirm that while it's unlikely, it's not impossible. Some babies develop cancer before they're born. \n\nOne of my biggest fears is getting cancer. There's a lot of cancer in my family, and I meet risk factors for the types we know about. A lot of my relatives died young, so they could've had cancer too, and we just never knew about it. But I hesitate to bring up the C Word with my docs because sometimes it does more damage than good. \n\nMy vigilance and awareness plays against me. I learned a long time ago that if I talk with my doctor about every little thing that concerns me they might start seeing me as a hypochondriac and nothing else. Maybe I am a hypochondriac, I don't know.\n\nSo I've become selective. I fight back the anxiety, give it some time, and see what happens. And that's why I've come here. I've given it time, but I've never had anything like this happen before, so it's hard for me to tell if this is something serious. \n\nAlmost 2 months ago I noticed what I thought was a rash on my left breast. But it doesn't behave like a rash. It's not itchy or painful, the skin isn't rough or flaky, and cleansing the area doesn't affect it at all. They just look like discolored pock marks or something. \n\nThey cover about 35% of my left breast. I thought my right breast was clear, but a week ago I felt a tiny pinch of pain and used my finger to rub it. I came across a small lump. But I didn't think it was anything to worry about. I thought it might just be a lymph node.\n\nI'm on the antibiotics because of an unrelated infection that got out of control. I only take antibiotics in extreme situations. This is the first time I've had them in 10 years. They've been very effective, the infection that caused me to go on them is almost completely gone. \n\nBut now I'm getting worried because the stuff on my breasts hasn't changed at all. I'm almost done with the antibiotics, I only have a few doses left. If it were bacterial, like I thought, it should be gone by now. \n\nIt's not itchy or painful, I don't apply any creams or cosmetics anywhere, the only thing I use is lotion, but I don't use it on my chest. I sleep naked and don't wear a lot of clothes when I'm home (which is where I spend the majority of my time), so I doubt it's from fabric. Plus if it was something like that you'd think it would change over time. \n\nI can't think of anything that could set a reaction off. But I'm hoping I'm missing something. I'm not an expert, after all. \n\nWith my left breast it started as a few spots, then expanded to its current state over 3 days. It's been like that ever since. I'm assuming the lump on my right breast has been there the whole time and I just didn't notice it. \n\nThe lump is hard, oblong, and about the size of a large grain of rice. It's close to the surface and doesn't move. Messing with it doesn't cause any pain. \n\nSo. Should I schedule a mammogram? Or should I try an antifungal cream or something first? I just got a new doctor, so I'd like to keep my hysterics to a minimum. I don't want to scare them off so soon. And I hate mammograms, too. My breasts are so small it's almost impossible to get them between the glass. \n\nOh, one last thing. I have no clue if it could have anything to do with this, but since there's skin involved I should point out that I meet almost all of the risk factors for melanoma. \n\nSome of my moles have been getting a little squirrely lately, too, but I've held off on getting them checked out because of what I talked about earlier. But I should point out that one of the moles I've been keeping an eye on sits right between my breasts. \n\nI've also been suffering from severe digestive issues for the past few years. Again, I don't know if it's related. But it has caused me to lose a lot of weight, and I can't gain it back no matter how hard I try. My bra size went from a 34B to a 32A (which is a very difficult size to find, by the way). My ideal weight is 115. I haven't been able to get above 100 for more than a year. It doesn't sound like much, but for someone my height it makes a huge difference. It's an obvious and visible difference. \n\nI started tracking it, and it's definitely not food-related. It's completely unpredictable. Cutting out preservatives and additives helped a bit, but it's still a big problem. I'm showing signs of malnutrition and malabsorption. It's gotten to the point where I'm actually afraid to eat, especially if I'm on a road trip or in a situation where I can't lie down or run to a bathroom if it hits. \n\nI don't know. There's a strong possibility that I'm overreacting. I'm the same age my mom was when she was diagnosed with cervical cancer. I know that one isn't genetic, but our childhoods were very similar, and she had to have a partial hysterectomy at 32. Like I said, people in my family get hit young. She was only 57 when she died, and by our standards that's actually pretty good."

Admittedly was a stupid decision by me, I did not wear any sunscreen that day and it was hot outside, it was 30c/86f with a humidex of 58% at the tops, which said it made it \"feel\" like 37c/98.6f. The length of the ride was about 3 hours out in the sun with breaks and two stops for food/drinks.\n\nI brought along water as it was a hot day and ended up drinking maybe about 4 liters total? Towards the end of the ride I began to feel a bit weak and started to get a minor headache, along with minor nausea, but about 10 minutes later I made it to the destination I intended to and got into the air conditioning. Eventually all those went away after I was inside for a while so I thought I just had been out in the heat a bit too much and thought as no big deal.\n\nLater that night (July 29th) I was starting to feel a bit \"sick\" and my body temperature was elevated slightly to 99.4f at the most, which I didn't really think was that unusual as I have had that happen after suddenly switching from a short bike ride to a long one.\n\nThe next day (July 30th), now not sure if this was real of imagined of me as I do believe I have anxiety, but I almost felt a bit of \"air hunger\" and a bit weak, but my temperature was mostly back to normal. I had drank a bunch of Gatorade the night before and today was continuing to drink a bit more. At around 5pm I noticed a little \"lump\" on my upper left abdomen area that looks like this &gt;  [https://i.imgur.com/CVeGpTC.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/CVeGpTC.jpg). I also vomited once that day.\n\nThe next morning (July 31st) the lump was still there but I think the \"air hunger\" was gone. But I vomited again that day, and decided to go to a medical clinic and the physician there had said that nothing was amiss when felt it, so I started to get a bit of relief from that. My bowel movements have been consistently runny or coming out in small \"pebbles\" ever since the first day and were still doing that even today.\n\nNow on August 1st is where I started to get really worried, for some of the day I felt really \"out of it\" but eventually I recovered from it. Later that day I think my fingernails went slightly discolored (purple-like) and my foot also slightly discolored whenever I put it down for a long amount of time. Also have slight \"bursts\" of pain in all of them every now and then. Later that day I \\*THINK\\*, but not 100% sure, that there might be another slight tight part of my left arm a bit lower than the location of my elbow, and as well as something going on with my left calf, but again, I cannot confirm 100% if this is new or just me noticing things being different from my right side of my body, picture of Calfs &gt;&gt;&gt;  [https://i.imgur.com/75Rtdo0.png](https://i.imgur.com/75Rtdo0.png) It also feels \"harder\" to the touch then my right calf.\n\nThis morning coincidentally had an appointment with a nurse practitioner and not noticing any new symptoms I don't believe, while I was there I figured it wouldn't hurt to ask about this anyways, she took blood pressure and listened to my heart and all looked normal to her, blood pressure was 124/70. She listened to my breathing and didn't say anything, so I was assuming it was normal. I showed the calf and she said that doesnt feel like theres any \"nodules\". I did not vomit this morning or yesterday morning, but still feeling general fatigue.\n\nI'm not sure what to do and I am scared that I may have a serious illness such as cancer, possibly sarcoma? My pee is normal color still. My weight seems like it is hovering around the same general area for now. Mom says since two doctors haven't seen anything amiss I am being a hypochondriac. When I lay down and press down hard in the lump area I can feel a mass of something that is different from the right side and can move it a bit when I roll my fingers around it.\n\nSorry for the long post but I am seriously getting worried even though two doctors said it didn't seem bad but I would want to get X-ray, or ER but mom thinks I am being hypocondriac about it. I don't want to die from cancer if I do have it, because I have never smoked or drank a day in my life, eat good variety of foods and have started to get more active lifestyle in the last year and all these people basically destroying their bodies with drugs and smoking will probably never have any problems.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEDIT: There off and on slight pain where the lump is on my chest, but gets worse when I touch it, I'm not sure if thats a serious symptom or it might just be me touching it way more than I should be these past few days, because it didn't hurt the first day until I started touching it and it doesn't seem to have grown in size.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEDIT 2: I forgot to add I have had a dry cough lately, it seemed to be at its worst yesterday but I find it is slightly better/less severe today, the lump in my chest may also be shrinking slightly today but I'm not sure."

It seemed like dry skin, so I put lotion on it, and I tried to get it to go away. Not only did it grow bigger, but I also developed a large spot on the front of my chest/collar bone, also red and itchy. Then I got a spot on my right eyelid. My coworker took a look and said, \"That's ringworm,\" so I got some OTC antifungal lotion (Lotrimin) and started treating it. We work in EMS and I've gotten colds and stomach bugs from patients in the past, so it's not super surprising that I could have picked up ringworm from someone at some point. Two days later, I had 3 more spots around the back of my neck, so I went to my local urgent care and said, \"Hey I think this is ringworm.\" The doc said, \"Yeah, gross, here's some prescription cream (Clotrimazole/Betamethasone Diproprionate USP).\" So I started using that, and the 'ringworm' stopped spreading, but every time it's faded/almost gone, it flares back up again. Now, as of about three days ago, they're getting bigger and more painful. The one on my eye is growing constantly, and it's painful, now.

It's not like heart palpitations at all -- I've gotten palpitations my whole life and I can tell the difference. Unlike the usual \"flutter\" feeling of a palpitation, this feels like something is slamming really hard against my ribcage for half a second. It's an intense \"squeezing\" feeling that comes with a powerful thump, and then it's immediately over. It's also kind of like if someone threw a ball and hit you in the chest -- force to accompany the squeezing, but nothing that I'd consider \"crushing\" or painful. It doesn't feel \"heavy\" or like something is weighing down on my chest. It's more like something slamming against my ribs or like my heart is squeezing really hard for just one squeeze. I'll check my heart rate afterward and it'll be normal.\n\nThis is usually accompanied by weird lingering tightness in the muscles in my chest/ribcage. I think if I move around, the tightness changes, but I'm not sure. My chest wall also often feels \"sore,\" especially if I've been doing any exercise that affects my chest, but I don't know if that's related to the powerful thump/squeeze thing.\n\nIt's always one, solitary squeeze and then it's over as quickly as it started. There is never any nausea, dizziness, intense pain, fainting, etc. No pain shooting down my arm or anything like that. I usually feel absolutely fine otherwise.\n\nI know I'm young, but I had a heart murmur all throughout childhood, and I'm extremely underweight, and have been my whole life. I have a lot of weird (but very minor) nerve pain and tingling that I've had my whole life that travels from my chest down my left arm into my fingers. It comes and goes, and is often a result of panic attacks or sleeping funny on my arm/chest. I have no idea if this is related to this new sensation, either. I do have a ribcage that curves in the wrong direction and I seem to have weird issues with my chest in general.\n\nI was scared enough by the nerve tingling to get an EKG a number of years ago and I was diagnosed with a benign Right Bundle Branch Block. Again, I have no idea if this is related.\n\nThis squeezing thing just hit me out of nowhere a few minutes ago and it was so deep in my chest and distinctive that it really scared me. I had to calm myself down over a few minutes and convince myself that I wasn't having a heart attack. I was almost tempted to hop in the car and go to the emergency room, and I'm still wondering whether I should go or not.\n\nMy risk factors are: extremely underweight, heart murmur at young age, Right Bundle Branch Block, anxiety issues/overworked heart from years of being anxious.\n\nThings against it being heart-related: I recently went to the doctor for something else and had unusually good/low blood pressure. I have no family history of heart disease or heart attacks.\n\nShould I seek medical attention ASAP? Is this more likely to be my heart or a muscle in my chest wall somewhere?"

So the recruiter wanted to make sure if I still have it by taking the pulmonary stress test.\n\nNow, my mother told me my asthma was very bad so I was prescribed an inhaler by my doctor. She then told me my symptoms were gone and I was very normal after the age of 2 so I stopped using the inhaler from there. All my life in school doing P.E classes I\u2019ve never experienced any sort of breathing issues or attacks, ever. Never needed any sort of medication for any type of breathing assistance.\n\nTo this day, I am a heavy weightlifter that is able to do intermediate workouts for long hours and I\u2019ve never suffered any breathing issues. My fear is that when I take the stress test I could come up with asthma without knowing. I just want to see from you guys how likely I could still have it from telling my life experience with my breathing?"

Sometimes it seems like she gets disconnected from reality and talks like she's a child, she blames her brain not working or the brain fog.\n\nHer quality of life is so bad to her that she constantly says she doesn't want to live, she's not going to make it through it, etc. My retired father is with her 24/7 and we don't want to institutionalize her, nor can we afford that.\n\nShe's now convinced that her adrenal glands are no longer working and wants to take supplements to support \"adrenal fatigue\".\n\nI've taken her to several physicians, including the ER, and a psychiatrist. We've run blood tests and the only item that has stood out is her fasting glucose level which was 102 or prediabetic, so I'm not so sure she has diabetes. Her CBC was normal, and her electrolytes are always normal despite her saying she's constantly thirsty.\n\nThe psychiatrist starting treating her for bipolar disorder but my mother is reluctant to take the medication cause her fear of the side effects and \"becoming crippled for the rest of her life due to the side effects\".

I keep reading people's accounts of what it's like for them, and medical definitions of it and going \"Jesus Christ, that is exactly how I am. How did anyone miss this??\"\n\nEg. Hyper focus on certain things that may or may not be important (I decided to learn Korean for no apparent reason, can spend hours studying grammar and vocab and have ended up in Korea because \"I just like it\", but have absolutely no plan. There is no reward for doing it. No one asked me to. I've got notebooks full of work I've done learning the language). \n\nAbsolute inability to focus on things that may or may not be important. Sitting there looking at something and desperately wanting to do it but not being able to make my hands move to do whatever it is. (I've wanted to go to university and get a degree for years, cannot physically get myself to actually apply, because there are so many steps that I lose focus and panic before I get even one application done. Have repeatedly tried getting together applications and have only successfully applied once to one university ((spoiler alert, didn't get in)))\n\n\nConstantly running brain (so I can't sleep and am slowly becoming more of an insomniac... If I wake up, it's like someone turned on a computer with 50 tasks running and there's no way to find the damned off switch again). Fidgeting (also, skin-picking absentmindedly). Really easily distracted, particularly with outside stimuli (I have to wear headphones in an office setting or listen to music or I will drop the ball, a lot). Inability to finish tasks (see university application comment)\n\n\nEven the notes on my report cards my whole life \"she's so smart, she'd do so much better if she just \"applied\" herself more!\" I failed whole classes because I was bored as shit and just left them.\n\n\n Homework alone should have been a frigging hint. I used to sit at my desk at home for HOURS trying to do homework and just couldn't get it done. So I'd get zeroes. Not cause I didn't know the content. Just couldn't focus and make myself do it. Hell, I'd get so frustrated I'd cry, give up, and go play video games. Which were always easy to focus on because my hands could be busy doing something and my brain could bounce around to different topics and not have to worry that I'd walk into a wall or something.\n\nI was also the kid that had 5 books on the go at any given time, had really elaborate play-pretend stories, was constantly doodling, and would get lost in books and movies for hours to the point of not eating or sleeping well past exhaustion or hunger pangs (I'd be so hungry I'd start getting headaches, but just want to do one more chapter or level or episode). \n\nAs an adult, I can cope reasonably well. I budget well, I pay bills on time, and in a job setting, as long as I am really clear on the rules and deadlines, I can follow them. But when something is at all unclear it becomes really painful to finish the task. I will procrastinate til the cows come home if I can't be sure what I'm doing is right. When I'm unemployed, like now, I have no one telling me to do things within a set time, and I have to organize myself to find work, apply for visas and schooling, etc.... And I am struggling... Hard. It's becoming a huge source of stress for me because the more I stress and know I need to focus, the harder I procrastinate. On top of being more forgetful than a goldfish...\n\nHelp! Please."

My blood pressure numbers are basically unchanged since a year or two ago. I'm getting super frustrated with the lack of any progress on the BP, and have recently changed doctors and am in a position (both my time and will, as well as now I think have a willing physician) to make some additional changes and deepen investigation.\n\nOne of the pain points is the beta blocker. This is significantly impacting my ability to further train and reduce weight. So **question #1, given that losing weight seems to be associated with improvement in BP: If I engage in weight loss surgery (liposuction in particular, or a tummy tuck) is that likely fruitful for the BP?** As a background, I'm already considering this for body image and physical fitness reasons (rubbing bits are driving me nuts). I wouldn't be doing it to lower BP per se, but if it is really weight reduction that is useful it might help me prioritize.\n\nMy **question #2 is with respect to minerals, specifically sodium and potassium. How should I be monitoring these? Is there a common blood test I should be asking for?** I'm willing to go in every two weeks and get blood work done if that will help me see changes work or not work, but I don't know what I should be looking for**. Related, my question #3 is am I correct that when on this many meds this is considered resistant hypertension?** I'm very much looking to try and learn more about the procedures that the doctor should be trying so I can be a well informed patient.\n\nMy **question #4 is what can I do to be a better patient?** As I mentioned, I have a new doctor who has a different perspective on these issues (and more time). Now is the time for me to up my game and get better informed and do a better job detailing what is happening. I'm reading great little press releases about snipping nerves going to kidneys, but I don't have any idea where I sit on that continuum of \"well its not so great\" to some surgery (or worse, stroke). I was reading the ACC guidelines and I liked the last one : \"Every adult with hypertension should have a clear, detailed, and current evidence-based plan of care that ensures the achievement of treatment and self-management goals...\". I don't have this, but I think this doctor might be ready to help me form it. What do I need to both (a) do and (b) ask for to be a better patient?\n\nThanks for thoughts on this!"

However, I\u2019ve recently moved and now I\u2019m one year into a 6-year PhD program at a very competitive school, which has thrown my daily routine and sleep schedule into chaos. I do my best to eat well, and keep a regular sleep schedule but often that\u2019s quite impossible. I feel like I actually lead a healthier lifestyle than most grad students I know, but still over the past year I\u2019ve had severe migraines almost daily and terrible pain (specifically around my neck and lower back, probably from studying, despite trying to maintain good posture). In my undergrad it was much easier to handle and now this PhD program is my life, but my pain has interfered with school leading to several absences in classes and grades that, although are not terrible, are not what I strive for.\n\nI don\u2019t know if this helps, but about two weeks ago I did a comprehensive blood test and everything was at normal levels (except for a slight inkling of anemia - and I\u2019m now taking iron supplements).\n\nMy doctor says all I need is to stick to a routine (which I can\u2019t do very well with grad school) or suck it up and take pain meds to deal with the pain (which I really really don\u2019t want to do, because the pain is 24/7 and I don\u2019t want to become dependent).\n\nDoctors, is there any advice you can offer me? I just want to not be in severe pain all the time and finish grad school and anything would be helpful! Thank you :)"

        "reddit": "21m, 133 lbs, 5'6\". Chest pains. Issues have been going on for about 10 months but on/off. No current meds. Only notable medical history was a brief stint of hypothyroidism a couple years ago. \n\nMy resting heartrate is about 85-110, occasionally spiking higher if I smoke weed or something. I've never seen it go above 120 on my watch, but on certain occasions without it I've taken too much weed and had a kind of panic attack where I felt my heartbeat and it made me anxious and made my heartbeat go even faster and it was a kind of feedback loop. It would also cause more chest pains because of the anxiety.\n\nThe chest pain has never been too serious. I've had what I've thought are growing pains or gas and minor chest pains since I was little, but I never worried about them. Now that I'm older I'm a bit worried, as they seem to have a different quality. I also had an accident where my manager bumped into me with a fully loaded pallet on a power jack. I jumped away as it hit me so it hardly hurt, but I did fall over and have a small amount of chest pain afterwards, so sometimes I wonder if that was a catalyst... because the incidences of heart palpitations have gone up since then which was about a year ago. However, this also kind of lines up with when I started smoking weed more often,, but it's hard to say if that has anything to do with it as it happens even when I haven't smoked weed in weeks sometimes.\n\nOften when I'm lying down at night and I lie on my side I can really feel my heartbeat and maybe get minor pains in my chest every once in a while. Gives me anxiety. They will die down for a while and then come back a few days or weeks later.. They hardly hurt at all and it's not usually in the same location in my chest. There was one episode about 10 months ago where I woke up after struggling to get much sleep and my heart was beating quickly, I could really \"feel it\" and the pains were quite regular although mundane. I was freaking out and had a mini panic attack and called the nurse and scheduled an appointment. \n\nAt the doctor's office my heartrate was like 110 I believe, and they gave me an ECG (ekg?) and determined I had some type of arryythmia, but everything else seemed alright. Chalked up some of it to anxiety and anxiety about being in a doctor's office. They didn't think it was serious but they referred me to a cardiologist and he recommended I get an echocardiogram, just to make sure. I believe he said I had **\"LGL\"** as well but I don't remember exactly what that was. He said it's likely not serious. I know at this point you're wondering... \"your doctor told you, why didn't you do it?\" And the truth is that the damn thing would cost $900. I know it's my health and that's important, but I felt bad putting that cost on my family. We're not poor, but we're not exactly rich either. So spending money on something that seems like it's *probably* not a big deal isn't what I wanted to do. He also suggested I could try beta blockers and gave me a sample, but I didn't like the idea of it so I never took them. \n\nNow I'm wondering what other medically educated people think. At this point, given the consistency of this issue, I'm thinking of just getting  it done anyway. Just for the peace of mind. At night I think how stupid it would be if this was a real problem and I could have prevented it, everytime I get a chestpain that's *probably* nothing. The money is a bit less of a problem now. I guess I'm looking for a second opinion."

I went to a diff hospital. I was in a hypertensive crisis. Systolic was usually okay, but diastolic was 95-125. If diastolic went down under 90 the systolic jumped up. Weird. Pulse had a normal sinus rhythm but tachycardic. 90-140 with some larger jumps I think. The docs were extremely thorough. Family history of HBP, Thyroid, diabetes and heart disease. They wanted to rule all those out. They also were concerned about my capillary refill. \n \nThey ran EKG, blood, and urine tests. For 3 hrs, they monitored BP, pulse ox and cardiac leads. Family history mostly ruled out. He wants some more extensive heart tests. Procardia to help with the hypertension. I'm switching to the ER doc for my primary. It was so reassuring to have a doctor treat me with dignity and respect. The whole facility didn't dismiss my concerns or look for the easiest answer. All electrolytes, anemia, thyroid, etc came back good. Doc doesn't believe the Vyvanse is the cause. It might contribute but not to that extent. \n \nHe wants to rule out pheochromocytoma and some others. Explains a lot of my symptoms. Confusion, excessive thirst, dizzy, lightheaded, pounding pulse, tachycardia, constipation, irritable, the weird shock/doom feelings, breathing through a straw, shaking, sweating, etc. What little I've read makes sense why he wants to rule it out. He said it's very rare but makes sense.\n\n----\n\nI have a few questions about what I've read so far. I don't want to bombard the doctor with stuff that cannot be related. I didn't have much understanding of it when he told me. I'm curious about the logistics behind these tumors. Yes I know I ask a lot of questions. I need to know how things work. It's a blessing and a curse. \n\n--- \n\n1. I have a lump on the right side of my neck. It's been there for years. It is hard and rubbery. Its not super painful unless you push hard. It's mobile horizontally but not vertically. Current primary dismissed it. If it has grown, it hasn't been by much. Currently about kidney bean size. I read these tumors could be in that area and be asymptomatic. Is that possible? Should I bring this up to the new doc?\n\n2. I have another lump at the top of my labia majora on the right. Very similar to neck, but does seem to be larger. Also been there for years. Gyn said it was a bartholian. I think that's the wrong spot and it won't go away. I read this is also a spot for the paraganglioma. Should I bring this one up too?\n\n3. I read people who experience serotonin syndrome should immediately be screened for this specific tumor. I can't take most antidepressants because of this. Haven't had any MAOIs. Is it MAOIs only or any serotonin syndrome? \n\n4. It seems the paraganglioma is a very wide umbrella that covers several cancerous/noncancerous types of tumors. Am I correct on that? \n\n5. Is it possible for these tumors to be slow growing, even if they did metastasize to the other areas? Is it possible for asymptomatic tumors to metastasize or do they need to be symptomatic? For example the neck spread to the groin. Then there's another causing the symptoms or possibly two since the heart symptoms started last year. Is that possible? \n \nIf you have an answer to rule these questions out, I would appreciate it. Even better if it's possible to explain why/how. \n\nThanks!"

It's numb to the touch, it has been since the wound was made, but it also aches at the same time? Also warm, but not hot. The color has remained in the wound, and it isn't swollen, I don't think. It isn't secreting any fluids other than the clear kind, which I think is normal.\n\nI consulted my best friend who, despite not being a doctor, has a medical history that needs to be carried in via a wheelbarrow and just knows a lot about wounds.

I have been steadily losing weight for about a year now. The only physical conditions I have are obesity (duh) and asthma. Since I was 12, I have had reoccurring pain in my limbs. My doctors have always told me it was growing pains but I am an adult now an haven't grown since I was 14. It mostly affects my right arm but every once in awhile I'll get it in my legs and left arm. The pain always comes one limb at a time. The pain in my arms is different from the pain I feel in my legs. In my legs, I usually get it when I haven't had enough sleep. It is like the worst soreness I have ever felt. It feels like it is radiating from behind my kneecaps and inside my hip bone and I can feel it all through my leg. It gets a lot worse when I sit for a long time, which, as a student, is what I do most of the time. My explanation doesn't make a lot of sense but basically, it is deep nerve pain. I get it about once every two months. Sometimes I won't get it for a couple of months, sometimes I'll get it multiple times in a month. Usually, it lasts until I wake up the next day but there have been instances of it lasting more than 2 days. For my arm pain, it happens a lot more frequently and the pain is a lot worse. I usually just wake up with it. The pain is from my shoulder blade to the tips of my fingers. I usually feel it in my right arm but sometimes it'll be my left, but always only one arm at a time. There have been times where I have been sweating, nauseous, and crying hysterically due to the pain. The moments when it gets that bad last 1-2 hours. But more often it feels like a burning sensation accompanied by weakness and loss of control. When it happens, I just keep the arm still. It hurts, but if I let it rest enough the pain goes away until I start using it again. I told my doctor and she literally just said, \"Oh, that happens to people\". I am now turning to Reddit for some advice."

Like the bar literally sits at 90, maybe barely passing it to 91 or 92 (I've checked from time to time for a few weeks now).

I keep to my old routines and do what I usually do.\n\nThe only thing I could think of that could cause this is, my college campus is quite huge and I walk from class to class a lot on a daily basis (last year was my first year of College), also I have not drank soda for like a month or two, but I don't know if any of these reason is a real cause. My mom thinks it's because I'm in my room too much and I barely go out -\\_\\_- tells me I have never had any serious illness before so I should not worry. She did scheduled a doctor appointment when I asked her to, though. But that appointment won't be until a couple weeks as it's packed. Yes, I'm seeing a doctor anyways, but I do want some thoughts from you guys, because this is giving me anxiety (I guess for the meantime until I do see a doctor). And yes I have been stressing a lot lately, and my anxiety pops out from time to time. Take note, I've never been one who gains weight easily. I eat a lot, I mean eat a lot... and I've never gotten fatter than my weights before. I've always been the same no matter how much I eat.

On May 28 of this year, I began Weight Watchers.  I believe diarrhea began relatively immediately upon changing my diet - which I of course attributed to a change in diet; however, diarrhea did not subside.  Before the change I was eating the Standard American Diet, and after the change my typical day included foods like: scrambled eggs with ham (low sugar/ fat free), greek yogurt (Two Good brand, low fat, 2g sugar, no artifical sweeteners), low fat cottage cheese, bananas, low fat mayo, thin'n trim turkey (mostly fat free/ low sugar), fat free chicken breast, cooked veggies, etc etc etc.  I eat little to no artificial sweeteners.  I don't eat sugar-free products, except for an occasional sugar-free jello. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWith this change in eating, I noticed that often times the food would move very quickly through my system, sometimes being passed less than an hour after eating and COMPLETELY undigested.  The two main culprits for this happening were banana, and salad.  One day I grabbed a banana on my way out the door because I didn't have time for breakfast.  I hadn't had anything to eat prior to the banana.  Less than an hour later I passed completely undigested banana.  Literally just chunks of chewed up banana that wasn't even mildly discolored.  This also happened once with water.  I had an early appointment so I had nothing in my stomach.  Over the course of two hours I drank two bottles of water (regular size) and not long after finishing I had the most urgent diarrhea and it was just the water coming out the wrong pipe.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's where it gets interesting.  My doctor ordered a bunch of tests, then referred me to GI who I saw on July 16.   \n She ordered more tests, stool samples, and a colonoscopy.  One of the stool samples I collected was to check the function of my pancreas (I think, and the result came back normal) so I had to eat a meal high in fat the night before the sample.  I ate McDonald's for dinner on July 16.  I had 4 piece chicken tenders, large fry, and a large chocolate milkshake (it was gross).  The next morning I had NO diarrhea.  It wasn't solid stool, but it wasn't liquid.  I collected the sample on the morning of July 17.  Due to a cancellation, I was able to schedule my colonoscopy for July 18th.  After four doses of the prep, I felt like I was going to vomit, which did not subside after taking a break.  I couldn't complete the prep, so I had to reschedule the procedure for yesterday, August 6.  In that period of time, I did not return to eating WW.  I was again eating the Standard American Diet and having NO diarrhea.  I had ice cream with no diarrhea, so it didn't seem like there was a lactose intolerance issue.  Gluten also is not an issue.  I had tested negative for celiac years ago, and also in a recent test.  (I mentioned this last part to the doctor preforming the procedure.  I said \"What's funny is...\"  and he replied \"huh.  That is funny.\"  Obviously \"funny\" meaning interesting/ weird rather than ha-ha funny.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI assume a normal colonoscopy result means diet changes would be the next thing that the doctor recommends.

She checked it 3x, inc manually, so I'm sure that was correct. She sent me to my GP. By the time I got there, it was much lower. I had a normal ECG and some bloods, all normal except for potassium 2.9 and slightly raised neutrophils. I checked my blood pressure at home 3x daily for two weeks - all fine. The GP said to disregard the abnormal results and wrote to the psychiatrist saying my cardiovascular health is fine.\n\nThen last Tuesday I was incredibly stressed about a work situation and I could tell my blood pressure was high again. I went to the GP and was seen by an ANP who said my blood pressure was high, but wouldn't say exactly how high, started me on 40mg propranolol 3x daily and was very emphatic about not missing any doses.\n\nI had a planned appointment with the psychiatrist who was reassured by the letter about my cardiovascular health and started me on methylphenidate - I've had the first dose today.\n\nI was anxious about starting the methylphenidate with my blood pressure so saw my GP yesterday, who seemed a lot more relaxed than the ANP, and said that I should reduce the propranolol to 2x daily, have a 24hr blood pressure monitor, but that I should be fine to start the methylphenidate. He says these hypertensive episodes are anxiety-related.\n\nMy question is, how can he tell? (He has been my doctor for twenty years, and I've also worked with him briefly. ) And, does it make any difference what the cause of the hypertension is? Won't it give me a stroke anyway, even if it's 'just anxiety'? Or am I worrying too much about worrying?"

It still hurts just as much as it did the next day and I'm very nervous to go to work (yesterday work was very hard for me). \n\nThe cramping started in my stomach in the morning and quickly progressed down into my upper intestines, spanning all the way across my body. The pain felt like my stomach and intestines themselves were clenching really hard, whilst also being squeezed on the outside too. The pain was persistent and constant, but the cramps and nausea would come more severely in waves. I was incredibly nauseous all day long but couldn't throw up no matter how hard I tried. Eventually my pain just got to the point where I couldn't just sit around any longer and went to the doctor for help. \nPrior to this, I'd eaten possibly bad pork and started to have stomach pain for a couple days, then the next day no pain at all really. The next day after that is when my pain became really bad. \nAside from stomach pain, I've also just been repeatedly dehydrated. Partly my stomach hurts so much I can't even drink water without it being in pain. My urethra has been burning off and on. Currently as of writing this it's burning again the morning after. \n\nThey took my blood and urine, then hooked me up to some IVs for a couple hours. The doctor pressed on my stomach and it was very sore where the pain was, she thumped on my back and it was sore where my kidneys were. They took a pregnancy test and I'm not pregnant. Eventually all my labs came back and nothing seemed wrong, it all came back negative. They gave me some anti nausea medicine which mostly worked, but I could still feel my cramps and very minimal nausea. \n\nAt the end of the day they prescribed me dicyclomine and ondansentron. I'm going to pick them up and really crossing my fingers they help out. \nThey told me if the pain is still persisting for more than five days I may want to see a stomach specialist. \n\nAdditional information: I'm recently sexually active, I suffer anxiety (and my mom and friend know how much I hate my job, they think my stomach pain is from how bad my anxiety is), I just started my period this morning (but have NEVER experienced any sort of period pain like this, it's usually just in my uterus and lower back). \n\nI'm in so much pain I'm desperate for answers. I know the doctors told me everything they could, they did everything they could for me. But I'm hoping maybe a stomach specialist is on here with any sort of ideas? I just can't stand this pain it hurts to do anything but sleep.\n\nEDIT: I don't have any chronic bowel disorders, IBS rubs in my family though. Over the past few days nothing has seemed abnormal about my bowels. No conscription or diarrhea. I can't remember the last time I used the bathroom but within a couple days I'm sure of, I do tend to notice if it's a little wonky even if I don't track that stuff."

My anxiety piled up I started googling which led me to it potentially being a heart attack so it started to be even worse. \n\nThings seemed better after a while. Besides that pressure I feel a bit of pain sometimes on the center of the ribs, often towards the right side but sometimes to the left too. It hurts on the ribs near the sternum. A weak pain but enough for me to feel it. A 3 out of 10. \n\nI still feel the pressure on my chest from time to time but it seems to only be noticeable when I'm sitting and slouching down a bit, if I sit up I don't really feel it which is really strange, if I'm laying down or standing up I'm alright. \n\nI don't know if this is related but on the Saturday,I played sports and got a blow on my ribs, not too bad didn't hurt much at the time, or the day after that \n\nIf I touch it, it hurts like it's bruised but there is no actual bruising on the skin. Never had a broken rib but I assume that's not what it is because it would hurt a lot more. It was on the left side toward the very lower ribs like the number 11 or 12 ribs. I mention this because it might be related but I doubt it seeing as how it was on the lower ribs and now I'm feeling pain on the ribs near the heart.\n\nI'm worried that it might something related to my heart which concerns me greatly. I don't have any diagnosed heart condition. When I was a really young child a doctor noticed a murmur in my heart but he said it was likely harmless and that I could do things normally like sports and that I always did and didn't have a problem. A few years ago when I was 15 or 16 I had a follow up electrocardiogram to see if the murmur had gone away and according to the doctor at the time said it did. I haven't had any exams to my heart since and never did I ever had issues like these I'm describing right now, it's the first time. Besides on the game I played in Saturday I felt alright, ribs chest and heart, all normal.\n\nLast night I got some sharp pains on my left shoulder as well and I notice that if I push down on my ribs it doesn't hurt but if I push down below it like where the diaphragm is it does hurt quite a bit and I feel that pressure again\n\nSo should I worry about it? Because I already am worried about it quite a lot it might be something serious. I have OCD which doesn't help.."

It feel about 1.5cm at most but does sometimes seem smaller but never fully goes away. It\u2019s not big enough to be visible and moves if I press on either side of it but it\u2019s concerning me because I can feel it with my fingers, it\u2019s not exact soft and squishy, and it isn\u2019t painful as it would be if I had an infection. \n\nI went to the doctors about it when I first found it and they didn\u2019t seem that concerned but then again I had just had a cold so I think they chalked it up to that. However it\u2019s still there over a year later. \n\nIn the past year I\u2019ve had blood tests for unrelated things which have come back perfect so I\u2019ve been telling myself that if I had lymphoma something would have shown on my blood tests, the node would have grown more by now and I\u2019d have more symptoms. Nonetheless my anxiety is driving me insane about it but I\u2019ve got myself into such a state that I\u2019m too scared to even go to the doctors for fear of the worst. \n\nDoes my lymph node sound like something I should be getting this stressed out about? Can lymph nodes swell in response to an infection but then stay permanently swollen? Is my lymph node even swollen or is it a normal size and I\u2019m just being paranoid? \n\nI know I\u2019d be better off asking these questions to my GP but in my current state of mind I don\u2019t think I could emotionally cope with going to the doctors.\n\nUPDATE FOR ANYONE WITH SIMILAR SYMPTOMS:\n\nI eventually went to a walk-in centre where a nurse told me to go to the GP and ask for an ultrasound. \n\nI did go to the GP and he had a prod and a poke and basically said that he\u2019s certain it\u2019s just a reactive lymph node that came up after a bout of illness and never went away. \n\nHe wasn\u2019t concerned enough to bother referring me for an ultrasound so I guess I didn\u2019t need to stress out so much after all."

The doctor declared this episode a \"panic attack\", gave me Attivan and an Attivan prescription and sent me on my way.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFollowing the attack I cut back drastically on Adderall. Cutting my dose from 20 mg 2 times daily to 10 mg 2 times daily. I didn't run immediately to my doctor ( yeah, I'm dumb ) and things seemed to be slowly getting better. I had a few more mild \"attacks\" that came and went very quickly. The smaller attacks lead me to give in and visit my doctor who really doesn't seem worried by the episodes. In fact he gives me refill prescriptions for Adderall.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJune 26th I felt something off while at work and could tell I was going to have some sort of episode on a larger scale than what I could just manage. So, I began driving myself to the ER and had to pull over when the heavy palpitations started. I watched on my watch as my heart rate hit 160 and felt as though it was pounding out of my chest again. An ambulance meets me. We do an ECG in a parking lot, looks normal. Eventually my breathing slows, my hands and feet regain feeling, my heart rate slows, and I am able to drive myself to the ER where and EKG, bloodwork, and chest xray all come back normal. The doctor does mention that this could be SVT (Supraventricular Tachycardia), so I go out and get an apple watch with ecg and begin onitoring attacks on it. I've caught a few, some that do look like SVT ( no clear P wave during a tachycardic rhythm ). But it's a single lead and it's not definitive.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI revisit my doctor after this attack. I do a weekend long Holter monitor which catches no issues during the entire test. I then have another attack two days after the monitor ( frustrating as hell ). I revist my doctor and am ordered more bloodwork ( cholesterol, thyroid, metabolic panel ) all of which come back normal. I'm also ordered a treadmill stress test (non-nuclear) which also comes back clear. My Dr prescribed Vyvanse and Propranolol which I've only been on for about a week. I've had no attacks on them, but I'm not in love with the Beta blocker, and without the beta blocker I feel like attacks will come on ( which could be new found anxiety from all the attacks anyway ).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI guess I'm at a bit of a loss on where to look next. I don't believe an anxiety diagnosis. Not because I don't want to accept that, but because it just doesn't seem to fit. Especially since I've had attacks flare up when I was falling asleep, not a care in the world. Just in the final throws of drifting off and then BANG minor attack. SVT seems like a likely culprit, but it seems like the only way to be believed is to catch it on an ECG and that has been wildly evasive for me.\n\n( edited because my format was wonky )"

They don't itch or hurt ever, they just get a little dry, and never seem to improve. I have similar, less severe, spots on the top of my feet.

I've had terrible anxiety, which has never been an issue, and I have a constant feeling of passing out almost all the time I'm awake. The severity of the issues tends to fluctuate throughout the day, and tends to be the worst in the afternoon.\n\n\nI'm going back into my dermatologist for a biopsy in a month, but honestly it seems like they have no idea what to do, and I was hoping the good people of Reddit could at least point me in the right direction or give me some sort of idea on whats going on with my body.

I was seeing young woman (20)  exclusively for a few months and we had both protected them unprotected sex multiple times. I stopped seeing her after a falling out, and that was it. A few weeks after the last time I saw her, I got very very ill. Symptoms included-  bad sore throat, bad body pain, cough, never had a recorded fever but it felt that way, fatigue as well. Went to the doc, mono suspected, took blood tests. Results: elevated wbc count, 20% reactive lymphocytes, positive monospot. This basically confirms mono right? Well I haven\u2019t been able to shake the idea of having hiv off. I asked her about her sexual testing and she said she tested negative for everything after we saw each other but who knows if she is lying. In the time since then too I\u2019ve had some weird symptoms. One thing worth noting is I had a wart appear on my hand and I had a weird growth appear on my leg while I\u2019ll. I went to the dermatologist for the growth and the biopsy said scar, but it\u2019s still here in a reduced form months later and if I touch it and squeeze it, it reacts and gets worse. For a few weeks I had episodes of stomach growling, a 2 week period of diarrhea basically every time I went, and months later now I have seen hair loss (telegen effluvium expected), beau\u2019s lines on my 2 toenails, sock marks on my legs and my arms feel tired and numb frequently. Worth noting that this fear of hiv has caused real stress, anxiety, and depression. I haven\u2019t tested because i would rather live with uncertainty than knowing I have it. A positive test would essentially end my life as I wouldn\u2019t want to deal with telling my parents, getting on medication to keep my alive, paying a fortune for medicine and doctors visits and especially never having kids which is what keeps my going.

At first it was almost unbearable, but after 3 or so days it started hurting a lot less.\n\nIt was about a 8.5/10 for a pain rating and I was super close to calling an ambulance (I was living alone at the time), but it was exam time so I just powered through it (I really think this was a mistake, as it may have had long term consequences).\n\nI still feel pain in the same area today but to a lesser degree, but it's enough to keep me up at night.

The pain also gives me nausea.\n\n**Initial visit to Doctor's**\n\nWhen I visited my doctor (about 2 weeks after the initial pain), I was prescribed Amoxicillin.

My problem is, I don\u2019t think I was depressed at 7, so I don\u2019t think depression was the cause of my dissociation then. By 7th and 8th grade I certainly was depressed, and beyond that for sure. So now I\u2019m not sure if I have DDD or if it\u2019s just depression. Any insights on this situation would be greatly appreciated. Thank you"

I figured it might\u2019ve just been water or something so I went about my day and didn\u2019t think much about it. The next day I woke up I noticed it again. Maybe even more so than the morning prior. Over the last three days I\u2019ve experienced hearing loss in my right year. ETN doc prescribed the meds listed above saying she thinks it\u2019s a viral thing. I had no fluid in my ear and no blockage, thus no reason for hearing loss. We discovered I have auditory processing disorder and that my left ear is very good (-5,~10) and my right ear is on the low end of normal (15-25) but is notably shittier than my left. To the point where I\u2019m misjudging sounds I would normally be fine with. Bad in particular was at 25 (minimum score for \u201cnormal hearing.\u201d Any higher any it\u2019s considered hearing loss. \n\nThis is where it gets a little more interesting. I have had shortness of breath. Constantly yawning and feeling like I can\u2019t catch my breath. I thought this was an anxiety related thing because it started two weeks ago while I was on vacation with my now fianc\u00e9. I proposed well on that vacation so I figured it was my body\u2018s response to being nervous and full of anxiety. I didn\u2019t think much of it but she pointed out yesterday that I was still yawning and not able to catch my breath. I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m struggling to get oxygen or like I\u2019m smothering but I know you Yawn When your body needs to breathe and get more oxygen which is mildly concerning. I decided to Google it out of curiosity and of course the Internet says I\u2019m dying so I thought I\u2019d come here and ask for anybody on here to give their thoughts.\n\nThinking about it now on my way to work today on my way to work I got super tired out of no where. Maybe I didn\u2019t get a good nights sleep and just got tired during my hour and a half drive but I was struggling to keep my eyes open. Once again it could be nothing? I know when you look hard enough for anything you can will it into existence lol\n\nThank you for reading and for any advice you may leave. Feel free to ask questions."

Only the occasional intense, but short lived bout of nausea. This is not normal for me at all. This time a year ago my appetite was very healthy.\n\nI work in a fairly physical environment, where being in descent shape is essential and am certain that im burning a lot of calories, but when I go to sit down with my colleagues, I notice they have 3 times as much food on there plates as I do. I'm certainly in caloric deficit a good percentage of the time.  I'm also a cyclist and I ride about 50km a day. In spite of this, I still have to remind myself to eat and I rarely feel ravenous in the way that I used to.\n\nOver the past decade my weight has fluctuated. Both in terms of muscle mass and fat. I've also had year long periods of making concerted effort to gain muscle through eating a lot. Overeating. After that I held a little too much weight and then slowly managed to work it off.\n\nI guess its also important to mention that I didn't really realise I was fat until one day I saw a photograph of myself. It came as a bit of a shock.  I know that sounds odd, but really, I just hadn't seen it. No idea how or why. Body dysmorphia or something. But when I did finally see it, it didn't make me feel great. It came as a bit of a shock and I felt stupid that I hadn't seen it and worried what my weight gain communicated to other people, especially when it really matters in my field of work. It also bothered me that nobody close to me had asked if everything was okay. But that's a whole other thing!\n\nI'm worried that the medication (provided below)  i'm taking currently, or the medication I took previously, has had a permanent effect of my sense of appetite. I'm now losing weight beyond the point that I'd like. I also worry whether fluctuating physical goals  and body self image has had an effect on me psychologically.\n\nThank-you very much for reading and any advice, thoughts or solutions appreciated!

I was previously also prescribed Provigil 100mg (to be taken upon waking up) but came off it due to its appetite suppressant qualities, but more importantly fairly because it had a strong effect of my personality.\n\nFurther information - I vape cannabis to help me to sleep.

I MAY have had a UTI last year, which I probably should've addressed, but never did (though I never feel pain when I'm taking a leak anymore).\n\nISSUE:\n\nLast winter, I started getting hives... every day. Nothing a Zyrtec wouldn't alleviate, but annoying nonetheless. I decided to go to an allergist, they did a few of scratch tests, but couldn't find out what the cause was. He diagnosed me with \"Idiopathic Urticaria\". He then sent me to go get some blood drawn, but I just didn't have the time in the following weeks, and after some time, I stopped breaking out in hives. So, naturally, busy as I was, I said screw it, I'm fixed, I had a \"diagnosis\", and I don't need to get my blood drawn. \n\nFastforward about 3 months, and I started breaking out in hives again. At first, I wanted to wait, see if they would subside like the last time. It's been months, and they haven't gotten better. I'm having trouble falling asleep, not because of the hives, but I have been feeling restless in general. I also recently started getting migraines - something I never used to be afflicted with. It's scaring me. I've probably had 3 in the past 6 months, when I've only ever had a single migraine prior.\n\nI had my blood drawn and sent to the doctor, and I tested positive for ANA (1:40). Additionally, my TGAB (Thyroglobulin Antibodies) were high, at 324, and I also tested positive for Thyroid Peroxidase AB, at 16. I don't know what units these are in, but I'm guessing they're standard.\n\nI booked an appointment with a Rheumatologist, but since there was no doctor available for the next month, I'm left having to wait a few weeks before actually seeing him. \n\nI'm in sales, so I'm clueless about any of this...

This is ongoing and is gradually worsening - 2 opticians (vision exp/specsavers) have deemed both eyes to be healthy and provided referral to opthamologist. \n\nAt this point I left job as constant headaches were unbearable (aspirin etc didn't reduce pain). \n\nSaw NHS GP around May '18 who then diagnosed migraines and cycled through possible migraine treatments - propronal, co-amizclov,amitryptaline, atenolol, triptans (suma/riza) with no change in symptoms.\n\nVisited A&amp;E in July 2019 with numbness on left side, spirometry/ECG test taken but results not listed on discharge papers (red flag?) - neuro diagnosed migraine 'scribed Zopiclone/topirimate. After following dose 2 per day morning/eve for &lt;1 week had intense headache 7/10 for 6 hours, felt out of character (stressed/hyper + twitching limbs), difficulty falling asleep (body would jerk at intervals - this symptom has continued). spoke with GP who stated allergic reaction so stopped.\n\nin addition breathing has changed - shallow breaths (x-ray clear) but coughing brown mucous up for 3 weeks with blood when brushing teeth from gag reflex. \n\nOther - constant non moving scotomas in both visual fields (cecocentral) and pain related to eye movement. Numbness to heat in hands, burning sensations in arms and legs which is spreading. \n\nAfter doing research I believe this is due to abnormality of brain or stem (visual disturbances), forgetfullness, personality change and external talking to people who aren't there as if holding a conversation. Mucous could be bronchitis - X-ray was cleared with no concern but didn't see final copy.

Also cognitive impairment - memory, processing are slowed and difficult than before (emotional reasoning, self awareness, sympathy). childhood memories are vague, don't remember much from before the onset of symptoms except 'snippets'. \n\nMost GPs have addressed this as anxiety however GP has said I shouldn't go for tests as am health anxious (results might scare me) and surgery increases risks but I know other methods than surgery and medication exist which will might help or at least have medication which will help keep symptoms down.

Is it possible that I still have BHR? Can BHR go away at all? \n2. Can a person have BHR without having asthma (or anything else) which the doc reportedly excluded in his findings? \n3. Can the BHR be the reason for having breathing problems during running? \n4. Can this also cause/explain the high HR during running (my resting HR is around 50-55 bpm btw) or is this just a matter of practise? \n\nI already made an appointment at a pulmonologist, but it's in 2 months and I'd like to know if it may be better to stop running, because right now I'm just pushing through and motivating myself with the fact that my overweight friend, who started running with me, can do it \u2013 so why cant't I?"

My primary care physician, and a cardiologist specialist that I've been referred to. I've been taking this as seriously as I can, but it doesn't seem like it's improving, or that anyone knows what's going on.\n\nSlightly over a year ago, I found myself in a situation where my heart would simply not stop racing. It was uncomfortable, made me feel more than a little nauseous, and overall I just was surrounded by what I can only call an overwhelming sense of dread. This hit me while I was at home, at rest, during a weekend. It persisted throughout the entire evening that day, and was still with me when I woke up. I called the advice nurse, and wound up going to the ER on their recommendation.\n\nWhile in the ER, they noted my pulse was very fast, but after giving me some fluids and observing me for about an hour or two, everything was fine and they released me.\n\nAfter that, I found myself having periodic episodes. Out of the blue I would feel either a deep dread, or else a sharp pain in my chest, which itself would pass quickly but leave me with what felt like a desperately racing heart afterward. Eventually I started monitoring my heart rate, and it wound up being nothing strange despite my feeling like my heart was racing. I'm keenly aware of my heart beating during these times, but my pulse levels off at 70-80 bpm, rather than anything out of the ordinary.\n\nAfter one of these initial 'hits', I almost always feel the pain or panic subside within a handful of seconds, but then my chest feels very SLIGHTLY tight thereafter. It's not debilitating, and I can breath fine, but it does feel like things are a bit tight up there. And what's more, my left chest and upper left arm feel SORE, almost like I've been punched or bruised, afterward.\n\nAfter a week or so, I tend to recover. I still have no idea what causes this. It typically hits me when I am at rest. I've never had it happen to me in a physically or emotionally strenuous situation. These episodes seem to hit me every month or two.\n\nI've been consulting with my doctor about this on and off for a year, and have seen a specialist. Initially I was outfitted with a 24-hour Holter monitor. When the Holter did not return anything out of the ordinary, but my symptoms returned later, the doctor outfitted me with a monitor that I wore for a full 30 days, complete with remote logging.The 30 day monitor also returned nothing out of the ordinary. \n\nLast night while I was driving home, I was hit by a sudden, extremely sharp pain in my upper left chest/heart. This passed within 15-20 seconds, leaving behind the same anxiety, uneasiness, and lingering soreness that I described above. It's been a few months since my last one, but this one hit harder initially that I'm used to. Even as I type this, things feel uneasy and sore in my upper left chest, even into my upper left armpit.\n\nOverall, the response I've gotten from the doctors is that I'm fine, and that this is just something I need to manage. I will admit it *never* feels like I'm short of breath, nor does it ever feel like my chest is being crushed. It's never hard to breath, climbs stairs, or lift objects. But it does make an impact on my life, in that I can't really ever relax for about a week after one of the episodes hits me.\n\nI will note that my father has had significant heart problems in the past. At around age 65 he wound up having a severe heart issue that required installation of a pacemaker.\n\nAny advice would be tremendously appreciated - Even if that advice is \"keep managing the symptoms\". It's just a little scary to experience these issues and essentially be told that nothing is wrong.\n\nThanks very much."

The pain is behind the eyes with sensitivity to light and sound accompanied by nausea and vomiting. I usually get these about 2-3 times a month now, but They used to be so bad that I\u2019ve accidentally given myself gastritis before from taking pain killers every day during a particularly painful week of migraines.\nI\u2019ve also had issues with balance since I was little. It\u2019s not terrible, I can definitely walk in a straight line if I try, but riding anything that requires balance (skateboard, bike, rollerblades, etc.) is out of the question. I stumble over nothing a lot, occasionally to the point where it\u2019s actually comical, but I usually just chalk this up to normal clumsiness.\nI suffer from vertigo and motion sickness. I\u2019ve had vertigo attacks where I wake up and the room is spinning super fast and gets worse whenever I would turn my head. However, these attacks are few and far between. \nMy motion sickness has been present since I was basically a toddler, but has gotten worse over time, and now affects me daily. When I get it, i feel very nauseous and it takes a few hours for me to feel normal again.\nThe last symptom I\u2019ve had is fainting. I have completely lost consciousness 3 times since I was 10 and had a few close calls where I was able to sit down and stop myself from completely blacking out. These are always accompanied with excruciating head pain right before loss of consciousness. I\u2019ve never went to the doctor for this (no one ever called me an ambulance and my parents were usually poor with no health insurance) I\u2019ve always just been told I was dehydrated and accepted that explanation. Now, after thinking about everything, I\u2019m not so sure... but I very well may be just linking things where there are no real connections. \n\nI\u2019m not really well off and don\u2019t have the best insurance so I really only go to the hospital when I\u2019m sick to the point of being bedridden. The only thing that really bothers me regularly are the migraines and motion sickness, and If I ever faint again I\u2019ll definitely go to the hospital... but just based off of my history, should I make an appointment just to make sure or is it likely that I\u2019m just reading into nothing? I always joke about having a tumor every time I get a migraine but I\u2019ve never really known other symptoms of neurological problems until now"

Appointment was today\n\n\nLocation on body: urethra/bladder\n\n\nCurrent medications: N/A\n\n\nNo recreational drugs, non-smoker, non-drinker\n\n\nI had a very uncomfortable urology appointment today and while one of my doctors confirmed this was really weird I kind of would like to hear from other doctors unrelated to the situation.\n\n\nI went in because my gyno suspects that I have interstitial cystitis. \n\n\nI'd like to mention he's very very specific with me about what will happen. He knows that I rely on a really precise description of what the plan is (I have really bad anxiety and sensory issues). So it was weird to me when I went in and the PA immediately scoffed and said \"it's never interstitial cystitis. They just claim that and send you off our way\". Then she insisted on pelvic floor massage which I am unable to do and I said no to because my gyno and I went over all the options and he didn't think that was even on the board of necessary ideas. She pushed and said that \"I injured my shoulder and got pelvic massage therapy and it fixed my shoulder\". \n\n\nShe claimed she had read all of my charts and medical background and asked if I was taking anything for the pain. I thought she meant Tylenol and said no because it doesn't work. She then started listing off amitriptyline and two other antidepressants/SSRIs. Then cymbalta. I got confused and told her I'm already taking savella and she asked me \"what for? What does that do?\"\n\n\nShouldn't she know what that does? It just sent off a really red flag for me because those are usually meds that you need to involve a psychiatrist for. And if she had read my file and is messing with those kinds of meds why would she mess with my antidepressant that is package insert for pain and depression? She also would've seen that I'm prescribed tramadol. \n\n\nShe also got really snotty when she asked if I had been surgically diagnosed when I said I had endometriosis which also would have been in my file/medical history. It also seems like any message from my gyno she just threw in the trash pile and came in with her mind made up that he was full of it. \n\n\nI guess I just need to know what to do. If this is normal and she just was kind of awful then okay but it really didn't feel normal. Do I tell someone about this? Who do I tell? She told me \"then just go back to your gyno and see what he says\" and (as I expected he would) he's sending me to another urologist, I imagine he's wondering why there was a problem.\n\n\nEdit: she also asked me about a bunch of food and drinks, I answered honestly that I just drink water with an occasional soda and about my food habits. Then she sent me home with a list of food to stop eating and all of it is stuff I point blank told her I don't eat. I'm just really upset because I had to drive a long way to get there, do things that will set me back anxiety-wise for days and she didn't even listen to that.\n\n\nEdit 2: There's also the unfortunate fact that the more stressed I got by her ignoring me and getting really pushy the more I started to stim. And she decided the best thing to do was start IGNORING me (I was still speaking to her, just no eye contact and moving my fingers) and only speak to my mother. I was then completely invisible."

I take zoloft and ritalin for add and depression, both managed well and I'm doing great. \n\nIt started in the first week of July, I was flying home and forgot my headphones, so I bought a pair of nice(ish) earbuds at the airport ($99 skull candy bluetooth kind). After a 4 hour flight, the inside of my left ear felt a bit sore and irritated, so I took them out and that was that.\n\nThe next day, my ear was still sore and I happened to be going in to see my doc for my add meds, so I asked the triage nurse to check it out. She said she saw a little whitehead inside my ear and that was probably causing the pain. I kept the ear clean and put neosporin on it for a few days. \n\nThe next week, it was still bothering me, but I was out of town camping for a family vacation. The pain got worse and it became painful to chew tougher food, so I started taking ibuprofen and that helped. I continued to keep the ear clean and put neosporin on the ear area. The whitehead was gone, but my ear was red on the inside. \n\nWhen I got back (3rd week now), I went and saw my doctor and he said there was nothing in the ear canal and it looked a bit red but that was it. He gave me a weeks dose of Prednisone to see if perhaps I had swimmer's ear or trapped fluid in my sinuses. He was going to try sudafed, but it somehow makes me very tired, so we opted for the steroids. \n\nA week later, I was still in the same pain. Dull, but sometimes sharp, inner ear pain. Dull constant pain in the jaw joint, and pain while chewing. My doc reexamined my ear and said he saw a small perforation but nothing else, so he prescribed a week of Augmentin to see if that would help. \n\nTwo days into the Augmentin, the pain became worse. It aches constantly and on a larger scale. IB profen stopped working for pain entirely, and I cannot chew anything tougher than scrambled eggs without significant pain. \n\nSo, I went back and saw a new doctor (mine was booked) out of concern. He examined my lymph nodes (fine) and sent me to the audiology clinic. He also prescribed me 50mg Tramadol for pain and gave me ear drops with a steroid and antibiotic in them.\n\nThe audiologist said my eardrum looked perfect, my hearing is better than normal, and he had no reason to think it is anything in my ear. He suggested it might be TMJ and recommended I see the dentist.\n\nSo then, I went to my dentist as a walk in and told my whole story. My dentist examined me, pressed all over my jaw and face, did a bite test and then told me that he does not think I have TMJ. It did not hurt at all when he pressed on any of my joints.\n\nI am set to follow back up with my primary doctor on Monday. The tramadol does nothing for pain, I just feel high...but still in pain. IB profen does not work, and I have not been able to stop the dull ache in my jaw and behind my tragus on the left side. Occasionally, my left temple hurts and aches now, too.\n\nAny ideas? I just want to not feel my ear and jaw anymore. The constant ache is beginning to drive me crazy. I am not sleeping well and have lost a few pounds."

        "reddit": "So a little over a week ago I was eating salt and vinegar chips (idk if anyone has tried the trader joe's brand salt and vinegar chips, but they have an extra kick to them and they're extra hard and crunchy too), and I think they destroyed my throat because I was eating them too vigorously lol. Shortly after, I developed a canker sore on the left side back of my throat. At first, it felt like a sore throat, but only on one side. Then I looked and I saw a white oval patch back there so I thought ok it's just a canker sore. But every time I eat (I continued to eat acidic and spicy foods stupidly) it would hurt tremendously to swallow and I assume it was further irritating the sore. It's still there and has about tripled in size, but the pain is way better now than it was in the beginning so I figured that's a good sign.\n\nI saw my doctor today for a physical and just casually had him look at it thinking he'd say \"oh yeah it's just a canker sore, it will heal\". But instead, he acted shocked and said it seems a little big for a canker sore (for reference its probably about a cm) and he said it should be getting smaller every day, not bigger and wants me to go to a throat specialist and get it biopsied. Hearing the word biopsy sent me into a tailspin of fear and now this seemingly innocent canker sore has the potential to be so much worse in my mind.\n\nHas anyone experienced a canker sore in their throat that got continuously irritated and got bigger before it healed? I made an appointment with the specialist for next week Friday, but I'm hoping by then I'll notice it healing and will be able to cancel the appointment. My anxiety is off the charts about it. I'm a 31-year old breast cancer survivor (totally healthy now) so have major PTSD about biopsies and health scares. Any insight to help calm me down about this would be much appreciated!"

Maybe longer, I just don't notice it as much sometimes. It feels like I am not getting enough air in my lungs, like my breathing is very shallow. Sometimes I have to really concentrate and make an effort to breath normally. I have also noticed that my heartbeat feels stronger than normal. When I feel my chest, it feels like my heart is beating strongest directly to the left of my sternum between the 2nd and 3rd ribs. I have also noticed a visible abdominal pulse that causes my laptop to bounce up and down a little with each beat when placed on my stomach. Sometimes my pulse is elevated, but BP is always around 120/80. I was previously told that I had moderate to severe narrowing of the airway and I definitely fit the bill for OSA, though I've never had a sleep study done. This becomes more obvious when I work out. I can typically tolerate 30 minutes on the treadmill, but have to gasp a few times to get enough air. Also, I tend to breath a little heavier for about 20 minutes after I run. I'm really out of shape though, with most of my girth in my abdomen so maybe thats normal. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm a PA student and it seems like my appointments with my psychiatrist always seem to occur around test time, leading him to believe that it is probably just anxiety. The thing is, I don't really feel all that anxious. After the second complaint of shortness of breath my doctor ordered an EKG, chest xray, and routine labs, all of which were documented as normal. He also sent me to a GP who told me that the heartbeat location and abdominal pulsations were normal and agreed with my psychiatrist that the shortness of breath was probably just anxiety. Now again, I'm a PA student, not a doctor or even a PA yet, but some things about the chest xray looked weird to me. The right pulmonary artery looks very enlarged and super dense, similar to what I've seen with pulmonary hypertension in my textbooks. The left hilum looks weird too, but I cant say what. Also the right heart border looks a bit enlarged at the right atrium. Also, why does the left heart border extend so far and slope like that?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe more I type this, the more it seems like anxiety, but the symptoms are really bothersome to me. And the shortness of breath seems pretty significant, especially when I go for a walk or get up and move quickly. My main concern is the chest xray and my heartbeat. I just want someone to tell me that I don't have pulmonary hypertension or some other cardiopulmonary disease that's gonna kill me in a few years. Can someone please explain my xray to me and tell me if it does indeed look normal?\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/P8hhdJI](https://imgur.com/a/P8hhdJI)"

Never get any answer. \nTall and skinny and have problems gaining weight. Generally calories stay around 2500 as I don't really know what to do and have lost any motivation to try gaining weight since anything I do never works. I've tried changing diets all the way up to 5000 calories a day and stay the same weight, but as soon as I cut back down to a \"normal\" calorie range I lose weight. \n\nNot only is it financially taxing eating all that food, it's mentally taxing having to force feed myself in an attempt to out some weight on and have no change. \n\nA little back story, when I was in my late teens/early 20's, I always weighed around 180, heaviest was 187, and I was still skinny since I'm fairly tall. A few years ago I had several infections from cuts and a tattoo and needed oral and iv antibiotics, 5 times in 2 years. I ended up with c diff and lost a lot of weight bringing me down to 169. Finally got the c diff treated after 2 years and started eating as much as possible and only managed to get myself back up to 175-178. I was eating big breakfast (eggs toast oatmeal) then lunch (chicken and brown rice with a smoothie) occasionally an afternoon snack. Usually just a nature valley bar and then dinner (usually chicken potatoes and vegetables) and most nights and evening snack (toast, pie or cereal most days). \n\nNow once the c diff was treated and I was trying to eat more and put the weight back in I started having more problems, I was drinking the smoothies everyday, they were roughly 1 litre. They were mixed berries, almond milk, oats, and a banana. About a month into having them instated getting signs of diabetes among other things. I would get drunk mouth, frequent urination, tingling in my legs, and in also ended up having a strange swollen tongue sensation that went on for months and months. Was told it was asthma or allergies and put on a nasal steroid omnaris. \n\nSome signs pointed to celiac or gluten sensitivity even though I had been tested and came back negative for celiac I tried a gluten free diet and also stopped drinking my smoothies. All my strange problems disappeared, but once again I lost more weight again bringing me to my current weight. Eventually I stopped the gluten free diet and eat whatever I want for the most part. Still don't drink the smoothies and for the most part feel pretty good overall. \n\nSo this brings us to the current issue, why can't I put on any weight no matter how much and what I eat. I had gone camping a few weeks ago and only ate 1-2 times a day for a few days. Only having a small lunch and then a big supper and somehow managed to gain a couple pounds but then lost it once I restarted my normal diet and eating schedule. When I was younger I never ate breakfast and hardly ever had lunch but always stayed around that same 180 mark. I eat far more often and far more calories now and somehow still manage to lose weight. My dad to day activity levels have been roughly the same as my job doesn't change much.  \n\nI've had my thyroid checked, testosterone checked, no longer have c diff, I'm not celiac, c reactive protein was back down to normal range last time it was checked as it was elevated during my bout with c diff, had the 2 hour glucose tolerance test to check for diabetes and it was negative,the only thing it showed was that my blood sugar dropped a little lower than it should have but they weren't alarmed. \n\nI just keep getting noticeably skinnier and I cannot figure out what to do about it. It should be as simple as, calories in and calories out but ive meticulously weighed and counted every single thing when I was bumping my calories up into the higher ranges and none of it ever made a difference. What's wrong with me and what do I do. I've tried the gym but stopped because I don't want the extra energy burned to cause more weight loss if all the extra calories aren't making a difference."

This started last week. I'm a vocalist and was practicing but got fatigued quickly, which doesn't usually happen to me. I drink about 90-100 oz of water per day and I've been gargling with salt water. \n\nWhat could cause throat swelling? I was just checked for strep and mono, both negative. I'm seeing an ENT soon but I'm getting so frustrated \ufffd\ufffd"

On Thursday, December 14, 2017, my rheumatologist took my blood pressure and it was 240/160. He sent me to the ER where I was given IV medications to lower the numbers and sent home.\n\nI followed up with my with my GP who worked his way up to a five drug cocktail but could not bring the number down. He sent me to a specialist at Vanderbilt who diagnosed me with refractory hypertension and added a sixth drug to the cocktail. When that didn't work, my GP suspected an absorption problem. He prescribed the clonidine patch which I still use and works most of the time.\n\nMy GP suspected a pheo was causing the spikes so he ordered a 24 hour urine test on June 1, 2018. The 5-H1AA came back slightly elevated \\[Normal under 6, my test result 6.1.\\] Based on that test and my symptoms, he ordered an octreotide scan which was negative. He also ordered an EGD and colonoscopy which were negative as to carcinoid cancer but positive for gastroparesis and motility issues. The NET clinic at Vanderbilt reviewed my file and said that no additional testing or treatment was needed.\n\nA few months later, I had an esophageal spasm I mistook for a heart attack so I went to the ER. My D-dimer was elevated so the hospitalist ordered a cardiopulmonary CT scan. The test did not show any clots or tumors. The ER doctor felt that I had a false positive blood test was a result of inflammation from rheumatoid arthritis. (My high positive RF test is in my medical records at the hospital but not my high positive ANA.)\n\nI continue to have intermittent spikes in my blood pressure -- normal for months then high for a few days then normal again with no changes in medication. My TSH levels continued to vary widely from test to test going from a 0.3 to a 7 without medication and from 0.35 to 5.39 with medication. I also have flushing consistent with carcinoid syndrome. My GP believes my clinical symptoms are consistent with some kind of neuroendocrine tumor (NET) but his efforts to find it, if it does exist, have failed. He referred me to an endocrinologist for further testing. She ordered some blood work just to appease him.\n\nOn June 15, 2019, the blood test results came back. My Chromogranin A level was elevated \\[Normal 25-140, my test result 176\\]. It's a nonspecific tumor marker that accurately predicts the presence of a NETs 80% of the time. False positives result mainly from pregnancy and/or long term proton pump inhibitors use but neither of those apply to me. It's exceptionally rare but autoimmune disorders and other malignancies can also cause false positives. Sometimes my rheumatoid factor and ANA are elevated. Other times, they're normal. My inflammation markers are always elevated. My C-Reactive Protein levels are in the 1-1.25 range (normal below 0.29) and my sed rate ranges from 35-50 (normal is 20 or below).\n\nHow would you proceed in this situation?"

Yes, the left side... not the right side where the gallbladder is located. It sort of felt like there was trapped air there or something. It very rarely was more than just discomfort.\n\nIn January, I finally went to the doctor and he thought I was just sore. I waited until around March before going back and explained that the feeling didn't go away. I had a gallbladder ultrasound which was normal, and a HIDA scan that showed my ejection fraction at 21%. Drinking the Boost shake was one of the few times where the discomfort turned into what I would call pain. Otherwise, it didn't seem to be too related to what food I ate -- it was just constant discomfort in that area. On a few occasions, eating a burger or something would make it more noticeable.\n\nI had an upper endoscopy which showed mild reflux which is being treated with Pantoprazole which ironically sounds like an Italian dish.\n\nI met with the surgeon and he basically left the surgery decision up to me initially. He diagnosed biliary dyskinesia. At this point, the discomfort was going away but started to be replaced with random and mild nausea after eating and a tightness in the throat when eating. I spoke with the gastroenterologist and my PCP who both recommended the surgery and were in agreement that even though my symptoms had gotten better, the condition will only worsen with time. I went back to the surgeon and told him I want to go ahead with the surgery.\n\nI am mainly put off by the fact that I've never had this horrific, stabbing pain that is usually present with cholecystectomy candidates. The cycling of very mild symptoms is puzzling, for example I just realized the throat tightening no longer happens as of this week, and I haven't really gotten nauseous for a few days. I've just been burping and farting a lot.. I also question if I have had this condition for long enough, that I have just gotten used to symptoms and not even noticed it. For example, I realized that I always associate eating fatty meals with having to take my time and feeling a little awful later and I guess that just became normal, whereas most people probably just eat BBQ as easily as they would eat a healthy, low-fat meal. But still, I never get any kind of extreme pain.\n\nThe surgery was scheduled a while ago and is finally early next week. I just finished my last job and starting a new job early next month so it really is the perfect time for the surgery. I'm sure I am overanalyzing things, but removing an organ is... a big deal I guess.\n\nI am mainly writing this just to help organize my thoughts, but I would be extremely grateful for some feedback on this."

        "reddit": "I am a 70 year old male, 5'6\", 260 lbs (down from 270 in the last month). I have suffered from various ailments all my life, including HBP and tachycardia (controlled for the last 15 years with meds), gout, a series of Wallenberg strokes in my 50s (none since 2002 when I started CPAP therapy). In recent years, I developed high blood sugar (147), which I have controlled with a high fat, low carb diet (105). Seven years ago, I was hospitalized for an inflamed lower leg (weeping large blisters), and difficulty breathing. I was diagnosed with pneumonia and cellulitis, and treated with high doses of IV antibiotics that left me with severe tendon damage and pain. The pain is gone after six months, but I still can barely walk. After two weeks in hospital, I was released (insurance ran out), but my sores were unresolved. My Primary (at that time) told me I needed to have the leg amputated. I went to a different hospital, and learned that I never had cellulitis, but rather Deep Venous Insufficiency, for which I only needed compression stockings. So, you can understand why I am less than enthusiastic about medical treatments. Two and a half years ago I was again hospitalized, with a DVT and PE, and have been on Eliquis ever since.  During my years of HBP, I apparently had some kidney damage, with my creatinine drifting on a daily basis from 1.4 to as high as 2.6. My most recent reading was 1.8. I had been seeing a cardiologist for the lat 17 years, primarily because of my HBP. Whereas every doctor I go to always told me that I am in kidney failure, my cardiologist scoffed at this, as all my other numbers, other than creatinine, have been stable for at least 17 years, and even the creatinine jumps up and down. About a year ago, my cardiologist was forced to move his office to a shared facility, where all the doctors look nervous and harried. He became short tempered. About three months ago, I was working out at the gym (felt fine), when I noticed that my resting pulse was 144. I went immediately to my primary. He did an EKG, that was normal. He did a blood test; everything normal. He called my cardiologist,  who added a beta blocker to my meds, and changed my calcium channel blocker to Diltiazem. We made an appointment for the next day. When I came to his office, he found that now I had atrial flutter. He upped the meds, and told me to come back the next day. Now, I had atrial fibrillation. The next day, it was back to flutter, with a little bit of fibrillation. His tone changed from encouraging, to an insistence that I must have a cardioversion the next day. I asked him about what I had read, that cardioversion only helps 20% of people long term, and makes no improvement in longevity. He confirmed these facts. I asked \"if that's the case, and I feel fine, why should I do a cardioversion that is not without risks, and would make no difference\"? He said that this was protocol. I told him I didn't want it. He told me never to return. I called him a few weeks later, and he had not changed his mind. I contacted my acupuncturist, who has been treating me with both acupuncture and herbs. I went back to my primary last week, who always treats me like I'm ready to die. He was angry that I had sought alternative treatment. he did an EKG, that showed no flutter or fibrillation, but still with tachycardia. He looked both grim and angry, and told me I must find another cardiologist immediately. I am torn between having to see another \"protocol freak\" in order to search for the cause of the tachycardia, and just relying on the acupuncture, but never really knowing what the cause of my issue is. This is causing me great anxiety, resulting in severe insomnia. There is a video on YouTube with Dr. Sanjay Gupta, a cardiologist in York, England, who says that there is no evidence that tachycardia is harmful to the heart, or that treating it has any benefits beyond helping with discomfort. I have no discomfort.  I feel fine, other than frazzled nerves. When I think of going to another cardiologist, I freeze."

I've been to doctors before, as in straight in the morning after it happened, who can't seem to find anything. I can't work out if it is anxiety related or a digestive issue.

Race: White Duration of Complaint: 3 months Location: Western Canada Existing Relevant Medical Issues: None Current Medications: None\n\nSo around mid to late April, I had a really bad flu. After this, its hard to say if my cough subsided or just lay dormant for a few weeks, as its hard to remember, but I do know that for the last 3 months or so, I've been having this really persistent cough. It usually doesn't bother me right when I wake up, and usually I don't start coughing until at least a few hours after waking up. It seems to be the worst when I go to bed, and am lying down, but it's not exclusive to that - sometimes in the afternoon, it will just randomly start up, and typically a large coughing fit seems to trigger more coughing fits throughout the day. On some days, I won't cough at all, but I will feel some kind of irritation or irregularity in my chest or throat when I breathe. I didn't notice this before, but recently I've noticed I've been coughing up a clear, viscous fluid, as well. As of today and last night, I've noticed that it feels slightly weird when I swallow, also well. It doesn't feel like its hard to swallow per se, just it feels a little weird on the right side of my throat when I do.\n\nI've seen my doctor about this and so far, she's sent me to a pulmonary function test, which came back normal, with no sign of asthma. I've also had a chest x-ray done, and it came back clear, with no sign of pneumonia, apparently. She also says my lungs sound clear when I breathe or cough. I also haven't had any heartburn or anything like that, so I don't think its GERD. I don't smoke, and I never had. I also don't think this is allergy related, as taking antihistamines has no effect on the symptoms.\n\nLately I've also noticed in the past few months the sound in my right ear has decreased a little, and have been having earaches in both ears for the past week, but its very possible this isn't related; apparently my doctor can't examine my eardrums due to earwax, so this could just be an unrelated case of earwax obstruction I suppose. I'm having my ears flushed on Monday prior to my next appointment with my doctor where I'll be having a full physical done to try to get to the bottom of this. \n\nWhat could be causing this cough?

The rash has been popping up in some form for 2.5 years, occurring on my face, lips, forearms, lower back, and fingers. Diagnosis right now is allergic contact dermatitis. I have asthma and allergies, and take Ventolin as well as Trellegy Elliptica for the asthma and Prednisone and Clobetasol ointment for the skin problems. Skin medicines are off and on.\n______\n\n**Preemptive TL;DR:** Two years ago I started having really bad skin breakouts in a itchy weeping rash that often starts with/includes small blisters. It's been diagnosed as allergic contact dermatitis. Steroids clear it up, but it comes back every time. The rash is on my face, lips, forearms, lower back, and fingers. I'm coming off a long course of steroids and on the lowest dose of my taper, the breakouts are starting back up on my fingers already.\n\n____\n\nDetails (I have a tendency to over-write and over-explain, sorry if this is long):\n\nFor a little over 2 years now my skin has become incredibly sensitive, breaking out in awful rashes of some type. The breakouts happen in a few spots on my fingers, my forearms, my lower back, and my face/lips. \n\nThis post is specifically about my fingers, but the breakout does happen often in conjunction with breakouts in those other problems areas. I've been to my PCP many times, as well as two different dermatologists. I have been tested for autoimmune and lupus. I have had two biopsies taken (from my arm and lower back). Everything has indicated a diagnosis of allergic contact dermatitis. 3 weeks ago I was patch tested for 40 allergens and came back with some level of  reaction to ~15 of them, but none were things I come in regular contact with or could be traced to what is causing the breakouts.\n\nI have been on a cycle of going on steroids (Prednisone) my skin heals like 80-90%, the steroids run out, the problem slowly comes back, gets bad, repeat. Repeat. Repeat. Repeat.\n\nI never had skin issues like this before in my life, then suddenly at age 27 they started seemingly from nowhere. Honestly, the skin issues have affected every part of my life and have driven me into a deep, deep depression. \n\nI'm not necessarily trying to question the allergic contact dermatitis diagnosis, but I am wondering if there is anything else it could be. Or if anyone had any info about what could be causing it, how to go about treating it, how to find out what I'm allergic to.. etc. I don't know, I'm kind of feeling lost and hopeless.\n\nRight now I am almost done with a long course of steroids. I wasn't allowed to take any antihistamines or steroids for three weeks while the patch testing was going on and during that time my skin was awful, the breakouts got really really bad on my arms and face and back. They put me on a 4 week course of Prednisone - 40mg a day for the first week, then 30, 20, 10. I have about three days left on the 10mg dose and already my fingers are starting to break out again.\n\nMy face is also showing signs of breaking out again, but my fingers are bad already. They break out in a few specific areas - one side of my right thumb, the nailbed of my right thumb, both sides of my right index finger, and one spot on my left pinky. The breakouts are characterized by clusters of tiny blisters. Sometimes they can be seen forming under the skin for a couple of days before they swell up. The blisters aren't filled with pus, rather a slightly yellow tinted clear watery/oily fluid. They almost always burst open and leave open wounds that seem to constantly weep. The skin around the area also gets damaged from this process and the area becomes a raw open damaged area on my finger. From there it usually will begin to dry up and heal with time, the steroids help it clear up when I'm on them. If I'm not on them sometimes the blisters will just pop right back up in the middle of the healing area. But the areas will also inevitably come back, as they are now, as the steroids taper off.\n\nI'm linking an album with a few pics of my right thumb. On the lower part of my thumb (covered by bandage in some pictures) is the aftermath of one of these breakouts. This is it in the \"healing\" phase.. You can see the kind of open wound it causes and the drying/healing around the edges. It can often heal in a gross way with flaky/scaly crusts and thin flakes of skin forming and constantly peeling off.\n\nAt the same time toward the tip of my thumb you can see the blisters forming under the skin that I mentioned. The skin is only *barely* raised above the spots right now, but each of the dark spots under the skin will end up forming a tiny blister.\n\nAll these pics were taken today. https://imgur.com/a/YjUdyos\n\n\n**Questions:** Does all this make sense for allergic contact? Are the finger breakout and breakouts on my other body parts the same thing (the fingers blister *much* more, other places are more like a itchy red rash)? What could be causing these allergic reactions? Are there any remedies or treatments I should try? Basically just what's wrong with me and what should I do? :( \n\n**One 'theory' I've wondered about:** Although I'm not sure of an exact match in the timelines, these problems started around the time when I stopped getting weekly allergy shots. I had been getting the shots not for skin allergies (it had never been an issue at that point), but because my allergies triggered my asthma and I was also prone to getting bad itchy red eyes. I will admit that I stopped getting the shots rather abruptly and without warning due to sudden changes in my family life. Could going off the allergy shots have caused this? Is that nuts? Could starting them again be helpful? I don't know how likely this is, seeing as it's now 2.5 years later and I'm still having the problems.\n\n**A couple things that I've noticed seem to produce reactions:** 1) polyester. A couple of times recently I have had bad facial breakouts after taking naps after work. One time I used one of my wife's stuffed animals as a pillow, the other time I had blanket balled up under head on the couch. After checking both the stuffed animal and the blanket were 100% polyester. Polyester was not covered on the allergy patch testing. 2) Durad brand bandaids. I work for an urgent care office and these are the bandaids we stock. For years I was using them on these bad areas and only just a couple months back realized they were making it worse, and it wasn't just the progression of the skin issue. I had been using them on my arms and fingers and after being on for not even a whole day every place was worse off, severely weeping. Bandaid \"skinflex\" bandages have been a blessing and don't give me any issues. I don't know if the problem is caused by the adhesive or the material or what it is about the Durad brand, but I'm definitely having a reaction to them."

Xanax only recently started taking one month ago. \n\nWent camping two weeks ago in the worst area for mosquitos that I have ever seen in north western Colorado. I have pretty bad luck with mosquito diseases (got Zika + every symptom on my honeymoon), wondering if it could be another mosquito related disease. \n\nA about 2 weeks ago, I noticed small colorless pimple type things on the upper back of my neck, below my hairline, and behind my ears. No pus or anything came out if I tried to pop them. I have never had these before. I don\u2019t have acne. \n\nThey cleared up a few days ago. Last night, I was messing with my neck or ears for some reason and found that on the right side, behind my ear, I had a very small bump that hurts if I press hard on it. (I have been messing with it a lot now, which is just making the pain worse). I have pressed really hard on it and messed with it a lot today. Now it\u2019s slightly painful without me touching it, probably due to messing with it so much.\n\nEdit: Now that I have left it alone, the pain is not noticeable. \n\nI googled lymph node locations and it is at the bottom of the 2 posterior auricular area. I don\u2019t think the bump is noticeable by looking. It is behind my right ear. My left ear area is not swollen.\n\nI have no other symptoms of anything. My throat does not hurt, no neck pain, full range of motion, no ear ache, no headache, I can open my mouth all the way, no problems chewing. \n\nMy question is: What could this be and should I begin looking for a specialist for an appointment? \n\nThanks so much in advance.

Im being treated with exposure therapy for anxiety while also seeing a therapist for depression as well.\n\nI am trying to get back on Adderall XR before I start school. I took Adderall XR for 11 years from ages 7 to 18. I am now 25 and going to college soon and I wont be able to be successful in school without it. \n\nMy psychiatrist says he doesnt prescribe stimulants to people that smoke weed, so he would give me my prescription when I pee clean in 2 weeks. I am (or was) a daily smoker sometimes in the morning, and every night (not for sleep, I have no sleeping disturbances or insomnia, its just to zone out and play minecraft at the end of the day) I am being treated for anxiety by going to exposure therapy. I used to smoke weed for anxiety but after starting exposure therapy I didn't feel like I needed weed as much. He says there are hundreds of studies out there now about the terrible side effects and memory issues, and anxiety associated with marijuana mixed with stimulants. I have never experienced anxiety of any sort in the 11 years I took adderall and I've only been smoking weed for about a year and a half now and never had weed induced anxiety in that time as well. \n\nHe says i have a dependency, which I dont. I just like chilling. So he would prefer to have me on either xanax or klonopin because I am taking hydroxazine as needed (which I dont need as much now) but he doesnt want me to smoke weed. But he highly recommends i try a benzodiazepine to see if it helps my anxiety.  But with my progress in therapy i feel like i soon wont need to be taking anything for anxiety. \n\nI dont see an issue with smoking at all besides smoking not being the best method. Edibles are expensive, ha. I dont see an issue as long as I am continuing to progress in therapy which I am consistently every time I go my goals are completed. I wouldnt smoke weed while I need to study because thats counter productive. I dont even mind not being a daily smoker, i would like to do it once a month because I do visit family and smoke with them when I visit. \n\nAre there studies to read about the interaction? Is he blowing smoke up my butt? I met him on august 2nd and he gave me 2 weeks to pee clean but with my weight and being a daily smoker I feel like he's setting me up for failure and he wants me to do weekly drug tests. Out of respect I quit smoking weed that day after I finished my appointment with him and have not needed, wanted, or craved being able to smoke. I just like it to chill.\n\nI dont want to sound whiny, but I feel like he's power tripping and is anti-weed, because my last psychiatrist didnt mind. I didnt get adderall xr from her because my insurance wanted me to have an adult history of concerta and vyvanse (which we also tried on me as a child before we settled on adderall xr) and now that I have that adult history I will be approved for adderall xr. \n\nI dunno, Im sorry for bringing it up but I smoke socially while gaming with friends online at night time and when i visit family for a weekend once a month and I love the social aspect.\n\nAny help or opinipns would be awesome sorry for being a dummy about wanting to smoke weed.

I had seen obstetricians for pregnancy and I had seen a GP for a physical therapy referral for pain but otherwise I just never went to a doctor until I was having neurological issues about a month ago and I went to the ER. Through the testing and whatnot they found these aneurysms which they\u2019ve recommended treatment for. I also had had chronic pain for years and years but I just really dislike going to the doctor so I had tried physical therapy and then I just kept doing the exercises but my joints kept getting worse. \n\nAnyway. I\u2019ve ended up with the current medical issues listed but they\u2019ve only been focusing on the brain stuff so I haven\u2019t had a chance to ask a doctor about anything else. \n\nI just always assumed I was fine, just in pain, but I figured everyone is in pain. But now I\u2019m questioning everything. \n\nSo about a year ago I started having heart palpitations. It just happened one day and I was pregnant at the time but so I googled it and found that heart palpitations during pregnancy are really common so i didn\u2019t worry about it. \n\nBut now they have become increasingly frequent. It feels like my heart goes \u201cfwhump\u201d and all the air leaves me for a second, like when the wind gets knocked out of you. But just for a second, and then my heart flutters and beats faster for a second and then it\u2019s fine. It happens several times a day now, doesn\u2019t matter what I\u2019m doing. It\u2019s not painful, it just feels strange. \n\nI had an ekg (eeg? ECG? Where they put the little things on you and have a handheld device?) at one of the appointments the other day and it was normal but again, we\u2019ve just been focusing on the neurological problems and my understanding was heart palpitations are generally benign so i hadn\u2019t asked about it.\n\nBut now I\u2019m wondering if I should make another appointment to ask about it. The other thing is I recently learned more about my family history, as my dad was adopted but he recently passed away so I\u2019ve been in touch with his bio family who told me that several of them also have cerebrovascular issues and that my aunt, uncle and grandfather all had to have multiple bypass surgery in their 30s even as non smokers without high blood pressure and otherwise healthy people due to some kind of genetic predisposition. \n\nSo, as i said in my title, when do heart palpitations need to be checked out?"

Overall I have a very complex health history, and recently been diagnosed with complex ptsd which is impairing my memory and overall state of well being. \n\nCurrent/previous diagnosis:\nDehydration (disease)\nRathkes cleft cyst \nSyrinx 1.7mm - diameter in C6-C7\nChronic migraines \nChronic abdominal pain\n3cm ovarian complex cyst \nDegenerative disk disease \nScoliosis (started at age 6)\nChronic back pain (started at age 6)\nIron deficiency Anemia (mostly ruled out)\nL arm numbness since 2017 (unknown cause)\nL arm weakness since 2017 (unknown cause) \nAcute gastritis (disease)\nHemangioma L Kidney \nPCOS (no test confirmed it, only symptoms)\nMild Mitral Valve Prolapse\nMild mitral Regurgitation\nL3-L4, L4-L5, L5-S1 herniated disks (no known injury), (diskectomy  performed on L4-L5 and L5-S1 due removing about 80% of my disks due to severe compression on my L and R nerves)\nIrritable Bowel Syndrome\nSinus Tachycardia w/ and w/o Sinus Arrhythmia \nHigh blood pressure (recently started) \nA few concussions (age 5, age 10, and age 15. I do believe I had more but I cannot recall my age)\nChronic Fatigue Syndrome\nComplex PTSD\n....... there\u2019s more which I don\u2019t remember from the top of my head. \n\nSurgery History: \nDiscectomy L4-L5, L5-S1 In 2015 (14 years old at the time) \nColonoscopy and endoscopy in 2015 and 2017 (no acute abnormalities found) \n\nHad dozens of MRI, CT scans, Ultrasounds done.  Echocardiogram was performed due to my consistent shortness of breath, dizziness, fainting spells, palpitations... etc. I got the report but never had a follow up so I\u2019m not sure what\u2019s up. \n\nMany ER visits, with multiple Hospitalizations for variety of reasons. \n\nModerate-severe Pneumonia at age 11/12. Was given some kind of mask to breath with medicine you put inside for home treatment throughout summer. \n\nUmbilical cellulitis at age 13. Didn\u2019t get diagnosed for nearly a month. My mom brought me to ER when I came home from summer school and told her my belly button was now also bleeding and blood in stool. I don\u2019t remember being in pain only how i was disgusted with all the crap coming out of my belly button and being able to see way deep into it. My mom said I was in horrible pain and barely could sleep for more than 1-2 hours a night. \n\nSeizure/pseudo seizure couple months ago which started at work, I seized for 30 mins. Foaming, shaking, etc. EMT gave me something and I stopped seizing but I was non responsive with eyes half open, I started seizing again on my way to the hospital and they injected me another dose. I gained mostly complete consciousness about 5 hours later  and they had no answers. \u201cPossibly stress or anxiety attack\u201d. I saw Mayo Clinic doctors who I\u2019ve been seeing for a month prior before that and they told me that\u2019s mostly crap due to my overall medical history and the fact that I remember I was not anxious and my environment was stable. I did however have back pain and abdominal pain and it started to radiate down my legs and it kept on progressing so I possibly started seizing because I couldn\u2019t handle the pain anymore. So my body was physically stressed and I\u2019ve shut down. I did test positive multiple times at Romberg test and a few other things so they wanted to do an EEG... I overslept (slept for 30 hours) so I never got it done. After a surprise medical bill I\u2019m not interested in any more scans... I also don\u2019t have time since I had to pick up more hours on both of my jobs to pay off my stuff.\n\nSevere infection at age 4. I don\u2019t have medical records but from what I\u2019ve so far understood I was septic and spent a few months in the hospital. Social workers and then some people from the government were investigating my house, kindergarten, church, and etc. since the infection I had was hecka rare and I had to be exposed to some rodents (I\u2019m not sure). Most likely my alcoholic grandfather poisoned me. \n\nI was severely physically abused through my childhood. There were multiple chronic sexual  abuse from at least 4 people. I do believe there\u2019s more but i don\u2019t remember/don\u2019t want to remember how far they went with it... I was emotionally abused up to age 18. I had at least 4 near death experiences. Few of them I was oxygen deprived for some time. Not sure how long but in one scenario I remember I couldn\u2019t fight the person anymore and my chest hurt since I couldn\u2019t breath in or out and I passed out thinking I\u2019m dying. \nSecond one I was found being blue. I was alert but not responsive. Blue lips. Bluish skin. Blue nails.. etc. \n\nDue to my past history of abuse I am not sure anymore if my chronic pain is a symptom or a bunch of flashbacks... \n\nI was given mostly on the daily basis: oxycodone, hydrocodone, Percocet, morphine, hydro morphine, fentanyl, gabapentin from age 12 up to age 17 and then I became to young for such serious meds..? I\u2019m wondering if I\u2019m also just experiencing chronic physical withdrawals? \n\nI have tried every treatment that doesn\u2019t include lain meds. Pain meds that are not narcotics affected me horribly. If they did help one thing (for example migraines) they would make my heart palpitations or mental state off the roof. Blood pressure meds work to a point. The one I found to be relieving my daily headaches and chest pain would make me dizzy or faint every time I\u2019d stand, sit up or just moving any part of my body... it was prescribed to treat nightmares and decrease flashbacks from complex ptsd but they only became more vivid and I\u2019d be triggered 24/7. \n\nI\u2019m currently in so much medical debt, stressed out and my pain is becoming intolerable. Daily tasks, my jobs, socializing, simply brushing my teeth is nearly unbearable for me. Not to mention my pain is also triggering visual/emotional flashbacks and I cannot focus on anything and sometimes I can\u2019t even understand where I am, what year it is, who are the people I\u2019m talking to and my reflection in the mirror... \n\nIm literally disabled to do anything. Falling asleep is horrible. I have to lay straight only with my neck being curved by a pillow to have relief of neck pain but then my low back becomes intense and I can\u2019t feel my legs for crap. Laying in a certain position to relieve my back pain intensifies my neck pain... I\u2019ve been sleep deprived for months and muscle relaxants don\u2019t help. \n\nAll I know is that oxycodone helped me before and I have nearly 0 patience left to keep on tolerating all of this and not even knowing what\u2019s the main causes... I know the risk of addiction. I know it\u2019s not a cure. But I\u2019m currently choosing between a happy functional addict who can enjoy life and brush their freaking teeth, or a sober painful, disabling and depressing life which I do believe  will drive me into committing  suicide.\n\nSo my question is, what specialist do I go to who can evaluate MY CURRENT STATE and LISTEN to my reasons for why I want oxycodone and actually prescribe it and monitor me. \n\nI\u2019m exhausted from all the procedures, tests, hospitals, etc. it just leaves me hopeless because I already know they won\u2019t find crap and send me home with no answers, treatment or relief. All it\u2019s gonna be is another huge bill that I cannot afford, \n\nI need advice on how to explain all this to a doctor without sounding like I\u2019m just looking to get high or \u201cseverely depressed\u201d. I know I am at this point but the cause for my depression is my physical chronic pain :)"

Shortly following this loss of vision, I got a headache that quickly grew stronger over the course of the next two hours until it was nearly unbearable. At that point my mother took me to the hospital, where we waited in the ER for about 4 hours, got a cat scan and blood work done, and nothing out of the ordinary was found. I was put on an IV drip with a mix they use for migraines(?) and it very slightly helped my headache. Going home that day, I found I still had a headache as well as issues with reading and my vision in general.\n\n\nThe next day, when I went in for my follow up with my general doctor, I noted that I still had issues with my vision (reading was noticeably more difficult, and things appeared as if I was viewing them through a lens of television static), and that my headache was still present (albeit to a lesser extent). She didn\u2019t seem to consider this of major concern and told me to follow up with a neurologist. \n\n\nI haven\u2019t had the chance to schedule the neurology appointment yet, but I\u2019m moving away for college in about a week and the fact that I\u2019m still suffering from some issues related to my headache two days ago, I was wondering if anyone could help me figure out what it might be? Currently I\u2019m having some trouble with reading, my vision is a bit touch and go (occasionally some things may fade out of my vision), my eyesight almost has the appearance of when I stand up too quickly and the blood rushes from my head, my energy levels are much lower, and I generally feel somewhat detached from things, almost like how one might feel at the end of an all-nighter.\n\n\nAt the time of the headache\u2019s inception, I had loss of vision followed by intense pain on the upper-left side of my head, as well as some minor issues correctly forming sentences (as this was at the most painful part of the headache, I suspect it has to do with the pain), and some nausea.\n\n\nTLDR: Got a really bad headache accompanied by loss of vision two days ago, now two days later I have low energy levels, a minor persistent headache, difficulty reading, and issues with my vision.\n\n\nAny help would be greatly appreciated."

I have taken numerous urine tests which come back clean. Seen a Gynecologist that ended with a normal ultrasound and a positive Ureaplasma test that I was treated for.  Seen a Urologist who said my urine was perfect and that I was probably dealing with anxiety from the UTI. I also brought up Interstitial Cystitis to him and he said this was not my situation at all.  Feeling defeated and believing I was crazy, decided to try and  fight it on my own. Mind over matter. It took months and was very off and on, but eventually I ended up with four months of bliss. I felt like I was totally back to normal and felt great.

I never met my biological dad since he moved back to Guatemala when I was young.\n\nHere's the skinny--\n\nOne year ago I had a very anxious day. I felt my heart racing and was feeling very jittery and anxious. Nothing helped- not slow breathing or a walk. I'm lucky to not have anxiety issues so this was really out of the ordinary. The next day I was watching tv and eating ramen when all of the sudden I felt... weird. \n\nTunnel vision, light headed, warm limbs, shallow breathing. It was so shocking that my body shot up without thinking. I stood there for a few seconds and then it went away. I figured it was a blood sugar thing because I hadn't eaten well that day (eg- ramen). The next day it happens two more times. The third day it happens 7 times, I fall, and my SO makes me go to the emergency room. \n\nEmergency room hooks me up to the heart monitor and we wait. THANK GOODNESS; it happens again. My heart rate started going up and up very quickly then \\*shot\\* up to over 200. Then immediately went to 0. I felt warm and things had started going dark. I felt weak. Heart then slowly trudged back up to 60's. I was admitted for 5 days in the cardiac unit.   \n\n\nMany, many tests were done during those days but these were the final results--\n\nIncident: Third Degree AV Block. Some up to 15 seconds long.\n\nGiven: Implantable Loop Recorder in chest.   \nThey wanted to see if it would happen again as they didn't want to put a pacemaker in someone this young if it wasn't necessary. It has not happened before or since that week. This thing can be in for up to 3 years.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm wondering what could cause this to happen? My doctor and electrophysiologist have no answers. They are absolutely wonderful, but I'm not really happy with their statement at my last appointment; \"We're not sure what caused it so let's just hope it doesn't happen again!\" Verbatim. \nThey stumped.\n\nI've started working out more regularly and eating more veggies. I have no significant health history. Just a clumsy kid with some broken bones, stitches, and IBS. No murmurs or anything serious. I wasn't even unhealthy before all of this- I biked and ate fine (not green leafies with every meal fantastic, but doing regular rate fine.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSorry this is so long. \n\ntl;dr (but u prolly shuld)  \nWhat can I do to help my heart?

It\u2019s not like a normal throat ache but kind of where the Adam\u2019s apple would be on a male and under that, almost like my throat needs water and is dry, but I\u2019ve drank a whole glass and felt like the feeling isn\u2019t going away and I can\u2019t really swallow as ... Efficiently as I feel I normally can if that makes any sense. I\u2019ve never had any allergic reaction outside of hives caused by panic attacks so I don\u2019t really know what it feels like if there\u2019s an allergy. I have taken Bactrim in the past with no allergic response that I know of. The only family allergy to medication is relatively distant, an uncle allergic to penicillin. \n\nCould this be a side effect of the Bactrim or a mild allergic reaction? As of right now I feel like I can breathe fine and I am going to let the other person at home with me know what\u2019s up and to maybe check on me. And if the symptoms do continue to worsen I do know to seek medical attention (especially if rapidly) and I\u2019ll probably take a Benadryl or something before leaving the house but right now they\u2019re not TOO terribly bad and I have terrible anxiety so I may just be scaring myself.\n\nThanks and sorry for the silly post."

        "reddit": "I have been experiencing a weird phenomenon since I was a child. My first complete memory of it is from the first year of school, so at the age of 6. It has happened on and off. Sometimes daily, sometimes it can be months apart. \n\nSome background info: Female 32, PTSD+anxiety, but otherwise healthy. \n\nI can't actually describe it properly, but it feels like my mind is rushing. Like it goes to fast and my body can not keep up. And my internal thinking gets louder and flooded. It feels like I am shaking and moving too slow, but those that has seen me  during this say that I don't look different. Sometimes my internal thinking seems to overlap. \n\nTo take the most recent event(about 1 hour ago), I was focusing on my knitting. Relaxing and counting stitches, when all of a sudden every thought that is probably in the back of my mind emerge at the same time. And in rapid speed. So while trying to focus on counting and moving my fingers with the stitches my mind is bombarded by thoughts about Stranger Things(just finished season 3 last night), my SO upcoming surgery, work issues, my own personal problems and everything in between. And it is just too much to handle. And it feels like my hands slow down, my whole body is trembling, my pulse goes to fast and it is almost like every sensation is heightened. My fitbit shows a normal pulse. So the physical symptoms seems to be only in my head. \n\nThis time it lasted for about 15 minutes. Sometimes it lingers, sometimes it also does a flip halfway. Like my mind is too slow, and my body moves faster. Most often the \"effect\" is minor. Occasionally it scares the hell out of me, it feels like I am loosing my mind and I just crawl to my SO to be held while it lasts. \n\nI have mentioned this to my psychotherapist. He sent me to a MR and an EEG. He suspected some sort of epilepsy, but it came back clear. I did not experience the phenomenon during the test, so I am not sure if that could affect the result. \nBecause I occasionally \"hear\" my abusers voices during this, they just called it anxiety.  My PTSD is from an event that happened 14 years ago, so why do I remember this phenomenon from the age 6? My therapist claims it is because my parents divorce was at that time, and that apparently I have been suffering from anxiety since that.\n \nWhat bugs me about this is that I do have \"normal\" anxiety-attacks and panick-attacks. I know what triggers them, I know why they come when they do. This thing never happens when I'm stressed, worried or triggered by anything external or internal. Normal coping-methods do not work. I just have to let it pass by itself. \nAnd neither my therapist or his team had ever heared about such symptoms. \n\nIt does not happen so often that it interfers too much with my everyday life, and I have sort of accepted that this probably will be part of my life just like my other issues, but there is a part of me that always wonders what is actually going on? Someone out there must have experienced this? Or know whether it is some sort of anxiety or something else?"

I am NOT a smoker. I was YEARS ago, as in my last cig was over 7 years ago. My doctor stressed that being in steroids and having a kid with CF could be risky, but I was only on it short term, and the only thing she is culturing is Staph A (MSSA, not MRSA) and in the past she has cultured H.

I did not think much of it, however, I began to notice it and 12-18 months later, the shoulder complete froze on me. I had to use my dresser to lift up my arm to put on deodorant in the morning, I couldn\u2019t sleep because I couldn\u2019t put weight on that arm and when I rolled to the other side, it\u2019s own weight made it uncomfortable. \nThe ER gave me a sling and muscle relaxers and sent me to an orthopedic surgeon.

I complied and completed it.\nIn the past month or so, though, I\u2019m feeling deep aches in my shoulder. Like you get after a day of intense exercise.

I live in southern California.\n\nMedical issues: sinus tachycardia, fibromyalgia, lower back/sacroiliac pain, migraines, bilateral monocular polyopia, bad retinas, overactive bladder, abdominal pain. Prescription medications: propranolol, duloxetine, amitriptyline, topamax, aimovig, methocarbamol, oxybutynin, magnesium oxide, generic depo-provera, and about 10 days ago started omeprazole.\n\nFor about 8 weeks I\u2019ve been having pain all over my upper and lower abdomen. Felt like it was pelvic pain and stomach pain. I\u2019ve lost 25 pounds over about 6 months without going on a diet. I get full easily. After I eat, it feels like my stomach below my ribs/above my belly button gets hard and I just feel general pain.\n\nThe doctor decided I should have an abdominal as well as transvaginal ultrasound: [results and images of liver here.](https://imgur.com/a/IRjvRrx) I\u2019ve also had a sore throat for about as long. No fever, no cough or mucus. Throat is just sore, dry, swollen. So I had a throat swab. Here are my 3 problems:\n\n1: the abdominal ultrasound says my liver is heterogeneous in echotexture. The dr didn\u2019t even mention that when I saw him (apparently it\u2019s kind of serious?), he just said my ultrasounds were normal and put me on omeprazole for 2 weeks until I come back to see him again. I\u2019m going to insist he refer me to a gastroenterologist. Any ideas?\n\n2: my transvaginal ultrasound says I have a retroflexed uterus. I have 0 kids and no intention of having any. I had a pap smear like a month ago, no problems. No new sexual partners in the last 7 years. I\u2019ve had severe dysmenorrhea (with no cause) since puberty and I would gladly cut out my uterus. So has my uterus been retroflexed my whole life and they never noticed? Or can this just happen randomly one day?\n\n3: the throat swab came back and said I have \u201cheavy growth\u201d of Group C Strep. The doctor wanted to put me on penicillin but I declined because I already take so many pills, and I figure the yeast infection from the penicillin is going to be worse than the sore throat I\u2019ve had for months. But then I read that most people are able to get rid of Strep in 7-10 days without antibiotics and I wonder why I still have a sore throat after a couple months.\n\nI see the doctor again next Monday. What should I tell him or ask for?"

Sorry.\n\n25; Female; 4\u20199\u201d; 115lbs; White; 2 years; Midwest, USA; Neurological; Atypical migraines\n\nHello, \n\nI have atypical migraines, mostly hemiplegic migraines. Sometimes I\u2019ll have Alice in Wonderland Syndrome with or instead of the muscle weakness, slurred speech, etc. \n\nI\u2019ve had typical migraines with aura for 15 years, but the atypical ones only started two years ago.\n\nI have two to three migraines a week, or about eight to twelve a month. So, not chronic. About half of these are atypical, the other half typical migraine with aura. \n\nThe issue is that the atypical migraines, despite only having 4-6 a month, are still pretty debilitating. It\u2019s become very difficult to hold down a job when I need to leave frequently- also annoying for others I need to call for a ride. It\u2019d be way too unsafe to try driving, you know. It\u2019s very infuriating when it turns out to be a typical migraine and it\u2019s all for naught. I can tell when I\u2019m in predrome, but not how severe the aura will be.\n\nSo, it\u2019s limited me to part-time jobs a short distance from home. Not a lot of options.\n\nDuring the first one, I went to the ER, then a couple different neurologists after. Ruled out everything to determine migraines. \n\nNeither neurologist would prescribe me medication though, because I don\u2019t qualify for chronic migraines (15+ a month.)\n\nI\u2019m wondering if maybe a different doctor would, though, because of the severity. Even just an abortive medication would help a lot, since I\u2019ve nailed down my predrome symptoms pretty well. A preventative I can understand being harder to get.\n\nIs there anyway I could qualify for medication? If so, any recommendations? \n\nI did take topamax as a teenager when I was having daily migraines- but it made me feel crazy, so I just won\u2019t want to take that one again. That\u2019s the only one I\u2019ve ever tried.\n\nMany thanks for any advice or suggestions."

And I kept doing it again weekly, but then I decided the razor burn was not worth it and I\u2019ve stopped shaving since like a month ago. The itching now is different from razor burn though. It is more like itchy than painful. Also it\u2019s worse whenever I move fabric against it, and when I wear tight clothing. And sometimes even my anus itches a little (ik gross to share, but I\u2019m desperate i\u2019m so uncomfortable) and obviously i didn\u2019t shave my anus lol. \n\n2) I moved locations a month ago to a place that\u2019s hotter, so I\u2019ve been sweating more and also I\u2019ve been showering more. So it could be the sweat or overwashing. But I\u2019ve lived in different locations throughout my life, never had a problem with itchy skin there or anywhere really.\n\n3) I\u2019ve been using a new body wash, but I doubt that\u2019s the reason since it\u2019s Aveeno specifically for sensitive skin.\n\n4) Since I moved back from college, my laundry is done by my family, but they said they use the same detergent as me.\n\n5) I\u2019ve used something with nyastatin in it for a few days now, not rlly solving my problem so i don\u2019t think it\u2019s a yeast infection? Also no discharge, and no itching inside my vagina.\n\n6) I took antibiotics for a UTI a few months ago, could\u2019ve messed with the bacteria balance down there? Also I feel like I kinda have a UTI again just needing to pee frequently not sure if relevant or separate problem.

Last time I went to my PCP in March he said I was throwing PVCs and that it was fine, which I\u2019m sure it is. I\u2019m just noticing them more frequently \n\nA lot of them time they come from the usual suspects; too much coffee, stress. I notice it a lot after I eat a fatty or salty meal as well. I have a long history of anxiety which I know contributes, I definitely get them during periods of increased anxiety or panic attacks. Sometimes I\u2019ll get them after I\u2019ve been moving around a lot. Like if I\u2019m doing chores and just running around my apartment cleaning everywhere\n\nThe episodes usually last for a couple of hours. It\u2019s not accompanied by dizziness or anything. If I\u2019m really running around at work or something I sometimes get the slightest bit light headed. Otherwise no fainting or other related symptoms. While I\u2019m doing a vagal maneuver, my HR will slow down, but as soon as i stop, it speeds right back up. It\u2019s a heavy thud, when I\u2019m really worked up I can feet it in my neck. It feels like a premature beat - my heart beats normally and then every 3-5 beats or so there\u2019s this quick, start of a beat that\u2019s followed by a regular lub dub\n\nCurrently I take 1mg Rexulti, 20mg Trintellix, and 50 mg Mydayis (which I\u2019m sure has a ginormous role in them. I switched from adderall to mydayis about 2 months ago, I don\u2019t notice them less since stopping adderall. Frequency is the same) \n\nNo physical health history. Just a history of anxiety, OCD, panic disorder, PTSD, you name it \n\nSo I guess my question is, does this sound like it\u2019s still PVCs? Or do you think I need to get rechecked? Last ECG in March at my PCP was completely normal. Since this lasts so long I\u2019m wondering if it couple possibly by SVT? The chances I\u2019ve to had to measure my pulse when this is going on have a range of 120-145. Which I know isn\u2019t exactly SVT criteria but it just seems so random and prolonged I\u2019m not sure why else I\u2019d be getting such long spells of it"

I never had anxiety before this, so I'm not even sure if it's anxiety, but I've covered a lot of bases and am unsure what else the cause of this pressure and heaviness could be, could something have been triggered chemically all of a sudden during a workout which put me into massive and constant anxiety?

They are very well controlled with Aimovig), my peripheral vision is constantly 'moving' with dark moving color filling in any light spaces (light coloured walls, etc). This is affecting my balance quite a lot and I frequently feel dizzy.\n\nFor the past week I've also been INSANELY thirsty.  I've been drinking A LOT of water. This morning I drank 3 litres of water in two hours, and then drank more water to the point where I vomited it up, but still felt extremely thirsty before vomiting. At work yesterday (office job) I filled my 1 litre bottle of water 6-8 times, and then went to a restaurant after work and had 5 glasses of water in an hour. With this is coming urination every 30-60 minutes. I have been waking up 4-5 times a night to pee or to drink more water. Pain free urination, urine is now colourless.\n\nOn Monday I ate some pasta in the morning, and vomited about an hour later. I also vomited later on Monday after eating something different (don't remember what it was). I also had a horrible headache (the pain felt like it was in my cheekbones) all day long and couldn't get out of bed. No more vomiting other than the water today, but I have felt nauseous quite a lot.\n\nLast night I was feeling especially disoriented and confused, with my depth perception and balance being thrown off a lot, and I think the altered peripheral vision is to blame for a lot of that. I felt like I was tipsy/drunk but I had only had water for liquids all day. I also noticed a difference in sensation, touching my hands felt different (reminded me how it feels when I am drunk, not sure how to explain that.), and my lips were tingling a little bit. I went outside; it wasn't cold and I was wearing a jacket, but I was FREEZING and i was shivering and my teeth were chattering. I got home and felt drunk walking into my bedroom, and then had another incomplete sleep filled with peeing and drinking more water.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI went to the doc today and they did bloodwork/urine work done to test my blood glucose and antibodies for type one diabetes, and the results come back tomorrow.

I'm having a lot of medical issues now that mimic things like MS and Lupus which I so far have tested negative for. It has been over a year of hell trying to figure out a diagnosis, it is to the point where it is causing me health anxiety and severe depression because I'm falling apart with no reason suddenly. I have had a few instances in the past as a young adult where I would get dizzy spells and suddenly find it hard to walk far or upstairs though I was active around the time (walking and biking for miles at least four times a week). Now I have gotten to the point where some days getting out of bed and walking five minutes to work is sometimes too much. Could all of this be some kind of delayed result of the Carbon Monoxide Poisoning I had a child or does that not have lasting effects? I also have wiped memories of my childhood that has been attributed to Ptsd because there is no other reason.  \nAt the time my whole family got the poisoning, my mom went to the hospital and they rescued us. The doctors apparently told my dad that less than one more hour and we all would have died. I was bumping into walls a lot during this time obviously from the carbon monoxide but this is something I do again suddenly.

Week 1 was severe cold/runny nose/tiredness. Week 2 severe coughing. Week 3 coughing and chest pain. Week 4 coughing chest pain and headaches. Week 5 minor cough and minor chest pain.\n\nDuring this period i went to two different urgent cares. The first was around Week 2, i took an X ray, came back negative for pneumonia, bronchitis. Prescribed amoxcillin and some steroid. No results.\n\nWent to the another urgent care to get see by this Doctor this post is about. Explained symptoms, x ray was done, came back good. Blood work was done, it was messed up in lab and no results were available. No flu or strep. Was not prescribed anything. Waited it out.\n\nFast forward to last friday. I start getting the same symptoms except this time I run a fever of 101-104 every day for 5 days. I go back to this doctor. Explain all my symptoms again, severe coughing, night sweats, chest pain and other body pain, fevers, loss of appetite, loss of weight, headaches, sore throat.

        "reddit": "Hello everyone,\n\nI am a 31 years old male, 6'4\", 187 lbs. I currently do not take any medications or supplements and never had any surgeries. I have a right sided inguinal hernia that must be repaired in the near future.\n\nIn late 2017, I felt very sick with widespread symptoms from head to toes (tingling lips, tip of my tongue was burning, painful teeth, feet feeling very cold unless I wore socks, burning pain in some fingers lasting for a few minutes, random pain in different areas of my body, etc...). My doctors couldn't find anything wrong in my blood tests. The symptoms persisted for months. They then suspected I may have had a stroke and stated that it could also be MS or brain cancer based on the clinical presentation. I refused to believe it and realized after spending so many hours analyzing my routine, researching online, etc... that it could be vitamin toxicity.\n\nI demanded a blood test to check my vitamin B6 level. I used to take a multivitamin (with 3mg of B6) for many years (eight years or so). I discontinued taking that on 12/30/17. The doctors and nurses were making fun of me and thought I was crazy for believing in vitamin toxicity instead. I ignored them and stood firm with my request. A few days later the results were in and I was right. B6/B12 were indeed in the toxic range. My fasting B6 level on 12/31/17 was 489.6 nmol/L (Reference range is 20.0 to 125.0). My PCP repeated the test and used a different lab just to make sure and the results were very similar. I've been healthy my entire life prior to my vitamin B6 toxicity diagnosis. B6 toxicity is widely undiagnosed and it is an epidemic globally. Very few doctors out there are aware of the serious life changing neurotoxicity damage that vitamin B6 toxicity can cause to the human body. Often time this damage can be irreversible and or can take many years to improve. 2 to 3 mg per day of pyridoxine can be sufficient to create toxicity in certain individuals. A few doctors admitted to me that they spent very little training on that subject in medical school. I lost my appetite after all this due to the stress, depression and anxiety and lost approximately 50-60 lbs as a result (205lbs to 145lbs). I developed seborrheic dermatitis (badly affecting my face, ears and eyes) at the same time (probably related). I was quite sedentary as well (not my style at all, I am usually very active). I experienced horrible muscles atrophy as a result of this perfect storm.\n\nAt the beginning of May 2018, I noticed a bruise on the side of both of my feet although I never injured myself. The area (side of my feet) was slightly \"sore\" and painful but the pain went away after a few days and would come back randomly. The discoloration never disappeared though. Please take a look at the photos after this sentence to see what I'm talking about.\n\n[https://ibb.co/cMoKsA](https://ibb.co/cMoKsA)\n\n[https://ibb.co/gsDVzq](https://ibb.co/gsDVzq)\n\n[https://ibb.co/k0zEQV](https://ibb.co/k0zEQV)\n\nThe following two pictures show exactly where the pain was located.\n\n[https://ibb.co/kZwHeq](https://ibb.co/kZwHeq)\n\n[https://ibb.co/gACCCA](https://ibb.co/gACCCA)\n\nI didn't pay attention to the discoloration since the pain was gone. A few weeks later, I was on a plane for 24 hours (traveling over 36 hours across the world). When I finally got home, I took off my clothes and noticed a deep indent in the skin of both ankles caused by the socks (severe edema). I was limping slightly from the pain too. I've never had any edema before and this was not my first long flight either. My feet appeared bruised looking on both sides and slightly discolored at the top. They were very red like if they were sunburnt (I didn't have prior any sun exposure). I had calf pain in my right leg and severe pain in both feet. It felt like a sprain. See pictures from that day below:\n\n[https://ibb.co/k1qAzq](https://ibb.co/k1qAzq)\n\n[https://ibb.co/cS8xeq](https://ibb.co/cS8xeq)\n\n[https://ibb.co/hr1Heq](https://ibb.co/hr1Heq)\n\n[https://ibb.co/hM7qzq](https://ibb.co/hM7qzq)\n\n[https://ibb.co/mOKEQV](https://ibb.co/mOKEQV)\n\n[https://ibb.co/hnAokV](https://ibb.co/hnAokV)\n\nEver since my feet and ankles have been feeling like anchors. So painful. It's also burning deep inside my ankles and feet. It feels like my ankles and feet are going to explode especially if I am not moving around. I went to the emergency room in June 2018 to rule out DVT. Blood work (CBC, CMP, thyroid panel, Hb1Ac for diabetes\u0014 came back normal, D-Dimer and doppler ultrasound ruled out DVT). Based on the clinical symptom only, the ER physician told me that I have stasis dermatitis (stage 4 chronic vein disease). He told me to wear compression stockings and move around as much as possible. He told me that I was too young for this and I should be getting back to 100% in a few weeks. He probably just wanted to get rid of me.\n\nWell the pain, swelling and discoloration never went away. It's been fifteen months since I have been dealing with a 9 to 10 out 10 unbearable burning pain in my feet that is constant (24/7). Nothing makes it better. I cannot wear regular socks anymore as they act as a tourniquet. I have to wear diabetic socks (completely loose elastic at the ankle line). I saw a vascular surgeon / vein specialist who performed another doppler ultrasound and told me that while he saw a little bit of reflux it's not enough to say that I have vein disease. He said what he saw on the ultrasound was the norm for someone my age with my work history, etc... I went back to my primary care physician, she did a very thorough blood work and didn't find anything. CBC, CMP, serum uric acid, ANA, CCP AB, RA markers, SED rate, vitamin B1, B6, B12, D, Folate, Magnesium, ruled out syphilis as well. I saw a neurologist who refused to perform a nerve conduction study as the severe edema and burning pain doesn't mean nerve damage according to him. He stated that the edema and discoloration is what's causing the pain. I felt the needles on my feet and legs so he stated that I passed his neurological exam with flying colors. My PCP didn't agree with that statement. I saw two dermatologists as well and they were completely clueless and stated that they never saw anything like this before. I am not taking any pain killers or drugs as they will just mask the symptoms and not fix the root cause. I am also traumatized since vitamins basically poisoned me and ruined my body so I have refused to even take anything OTC for relief.\n\nI would describe the pain as if someone is squeezing my ankles as hard as possible while my feet are marinating in boiling water. It never ever goes away. The discoloration started with my feet and now you can see on some pictures that my ankles are also affected. I've noticed that the pain intensify if I don't move around or sit down. The discoloration and swelling gets worse too.\n\nPictures from September 2018 below:\n\n[https://ibb.co/iLiYkV](https://ibb.co/iLiYkV)\n\n[https://ibb.co/kjkDkV](https://ibb.co/kjkDkV)\n\n[https://ibb.co/iDntkV](https://ibb.co/iDntkV)\n\n[https://ibb.co/gYFeQV](https://ibb.co/gYFeQV)\n\nPictures from November 2018 below:\n\n[https://ibb.co/kRbHeq](https://ibb.co/kRbHeq)\n\n[https://ibb.co/k3Eg5V](https://ibb.co/k3Eg5V)\n\n[https://ibb.co/i8FXCA](https://ibb.co/i8FXCA)\n\n[https://ibb.co/eng5XA](https://ibb.co/eng5XA)\n\nMost recent pictures below:\n\n[https://ibb.co/nDs3Hhb](https://ibb.co/nDs3Hhb)\n\n[https://ibb.co/jrtdcvY](https://ibb.co/jrtdcvY)\n\n[https://ibb.co/hgcH07K](https://ibb.co/hgcH07K)\n\nFor reference, this is how my feet looked like in May 2018 before the pain and discoloration started.\n\n[https://ibb.co/GMsg6T4](https://ibb.co/GMsg6T4)\n\nYou can clearly see the progression and discoloration of my skin indicating that something terribly wrong is happening. The difference is shocking.\n\nI should add is that my fingers are super sore. My hands are burning slightly as well all the time and often change colors (looks like EM and Reynayd's Syndrome). My hands feel broken and it is uncomfortable and painful to use them. I easily get cramps in them. The pain varies in intensity throughout the day (not as painful as my feet though). I live in a tropical climate so I wouldn't say that the \"cold\" is affecting my hands. I would say the warm temperature outside makes them worse actually.\n\nPictures of the discoloration of my hands below (both hands are affected):\n\n[https://ibb.co/P6RNd0S](https://ibb.co/P6RNd0S)\n\n[https://ibb.co/6Dcwqc0](https://ibb.co/6Dcwqc0)\n\n[https://ibb.co/nCMzG55](https://ibb.co/nCMzG55)\n\n[https://ibb.co/7Q2F10B](https://ibb.co/7Q2F10B)\n\n[https://ibb.co/tswnGDs](https://ibb.co/tswnGDs)\n\nI was never tested for lyme disease. Everything else was pretty much ruled out. Do you have any ideas what this could be (CRPS without prior injury? Small fiber neuropathy? Lyme disease?)?. I gave up going to doctors in December 2018. I currently do not have medical insurance. The doctors I've seen don't believe that someone with this kind of pain is able to be independent, work out five times per week and refuse to take medicine to control the horrible symptoms. I told them that I've been using a mind over matter approach and it is working although the pain is inhumane. That's how I was able to get back on track physically and mentally honestly. I don't even drink alcohol. I am no longer anorexic looking (currently weighing 187 lbs.) and my strength is improving daily thanks to the gym. I would love for the pain to go away as it is extremely difficult to be in constant pain like this all the time and go through life normally. Can I ever expect to make a full recovery? Any opinion would be greatly appreciated. Thank you kindly for taking time out of your day to read this and help me. Have a nice weekend!"

        "reddit": " Overview: I had a doctor's appointment and am wondering if his demeanor was normal\n\nSo this past week I had a yearly exam with a male gynecologist whom I have never been to. Once in the room I was made to wait half an hour sitting basically naked on the table wearing a medical gown with holes for the breasts. Once he finally came in I was seen for only 6 minutes. I had brought my own chaperone because I didn't want a nurse in the room, but I was never asked if I was okay with the nurse being there. The two of them walked in and it felt like the room was invaded. He never asked my name or acknowledged if he knew it. I do not think he looked at my chart before he walked in and did not take a single note during the appointment or even log into the computer (normally the doctor records my answers to questions in the computer). I was asked only a fraction of the questions I'm usually asked during a yearly check up and he did not ask about things I felt were important. For example, I was asked nothing of my sexual history or even if I was sexually active. He also untied the medical gown without warning me which made me uncomfortable.\n\nThe majority of the appointment was conducted in silence (aside from the basic questions he asked). I was given no warning before the exam began and was not far down enough on the table for the speculum, so he had it half inside when I was told to slide down, but rather than remove it he left it inside while I slid down the table while everyone watched and I felt humiliated. It was my first pap smear and he did not explain the procedure or even warn me before it was done and it was a very painful process. I was not told what tests or samples were being done, all I saw was the nurse handing him swab after swab and instrument after instrument and I had no idea what they were doing.\n\nHe spoke so quietly I had no idea that the exam was done and he asked me if I had any questions while his body was angled to walk out the door. I think I was the last appointment of the day and he was eager to leave, so it felt as if my appointment and me literally did not matter to him. I was not even given anything to clean myself up with after the appointment was done. After he left the room I literally sat there stunned and asked myself \"what just happened?\" because it all happened so fast and the appointment was conducted in a way that I have ever experienced. I know I should have spoken up about my discomfort, but it all happened so fast it was like I couldn't process what was happening in order to speak up.\n\nWhile logically I know I was not assaulted and he did nothing illegal, emotionally it feels as if I was violated. I've been having panic attacks in the wake of this appointment and haven't been able to sleep because I can't stop thinking about the appointment and the the shame and violation I feel. I went to my gp and was prescribed anxiety medicine and told to go to counseling. \n\nWas the way he acted acceptable? I feel as if I should file a complaint, but I'm not sure if I have the grounds to do so. This doctor has several one star reviews online, so I'm sure my experience is not unique. And personally I find it unacceptable that I need counseling and anxiety medication after an appointment. I have had gynecological exams before and have never felt like this after and want to let someone know so he can be alerted and hopefully begin treating patients with basic compassion."

        "reddit": " I feel trapped. I am going through a psychological crisis and am desperate to get back to my normal self. Some days have been okay but lately it seems that my insomnia is affecting my daily mood and I am once again starting to lose hope I will not recover from this. I have spent countless desperate hours researching if anyone has gone through the same thing as me and to a certain extent I have found some people online experiencing the same symptoms and I've even managed to diagnose myself of having a few disorders. I seem to be experiencing every textbook symptom of \"Marijuana Withdrawal\". It may sound like I'm someone who smoked for years but in fact, I smoked once in a BLUE moon and I mean that moon had to be blue because it was that rare. But exactly 2 weeks ago today I decided to smoke an entire packed bowl of a very high THC strand of marijuana while deep in conversation about the disappointment I felt about my relationship with my mother and how she was never there for me emotionally all of my life and therefore I felt that it has impacted me somehow. The deeper I got into conversation the stronger I puffed all the way past the shriveling eyeballs and then into another realm I have only experienced while doing Psilocybin mushrooms. A realm of elevated consciousness where my mind and body are detached and my thoughts are my voice, I heard voices and mine was one of them. I got up after my smoke session confused. Not knowing that marijuana could even take you to a place like that because as I mentioned before. I had never smoked THAT much. I lost my appetite immediately so I struggled to eat the chicken and rice leftovers I was so excited to eat just hours before. I began to stutter and my heart was racing in panic. My thoughts were racing ,What the hell is happening to me? My girlfriend noticed I was freaking out and she took me for a walk with our dogs to allow me to catch up on some fresh air as I was clearly struggling to catch my breath. As we were walking, I asked her to just keep talking so I could concentrate on her words as I could not focus my eyes or attention on anything. As she spoke, I just felt like my body was on autopilot as I was stuck inside my mind listening from behind my eyes. Detached. This feeling lasted for 2 and a half hours and I was back to normal and telling my girlfriend about my horrible and frightening experience and how I was not fully there for the past 2 hours I felt like I was merely watching. I was relieved this was over I never wanted to experience this again. No more smoking at all ever. I slept like a baby I woke up the next morning refreshed and happy to get back to the job I've disliked for quite some time now. I had no idea what was going to take place and is still taking place was a legitimate fight for my sanity and a struggle to find a natural remedy to bring me back mentally from the prison of my mind and body.\n\nThe very next day feeling happy and refreshed I did my normal routine, kept busy while listening to Joe Rogan's Podcast. Within 4 hours of working, I started to notice I was starting to feel those same detached feelings of consciousness, I immediately began having hot flashes. My heart was pounding and I was starting to panic because I had smoked yesterday and recovered from that experience afterwards, so I couldn't understand what exactly was going on. I rushed to the bathroom to breathe and tell myself I am fine and everything was Okay. My mouth began to feel as dry as a desert and I went through more water then usual. I also could not physically eat anything as my appetite died completely. I forced myself to drink fluids and fruit and even a cup of macaroni and cheese and could barely stomach it. I had to use the bathroom after every meal I attempted to eat. Fast forward to that night\u00a0, I slept for 2 hours, then suddenly I woke up shaking uncontrollably and having intense hot flashes, sweating profusely. My stomach was upset and felt like it was burning up my insides. On top of all of this, my mind was racing like a mad person and my heart was pounding like crazy. I was having a panic attack and did not understand what was going on at all. I normally slept like a baby so I didn't know why I was waking up in this way. I took a Valium that belonged to my girlfriend the following morning so that I wouldn't have to endure a restless and panicky day like yesterday. While I was at work, I actually felt normal. I thought it was over, completely na\u00efve of the valium I had taken and I even managed to sleep like a baby that night. The very next day, the Valium clearly wore off, I went back into my panic mode during the day and tried to calm myself down with breathing and I was feeling overwhelmed. I have never google searched so much in my life trying to figure out what was going on with me and if I can find a cure fast. As the days and nights went by,\n\nMy days were filled with:\n\n-Thoughts of panic\n-Tiredness \n-Low energy\n-Dry mouth\n-Intense headaches\n-Unable to focus my eyes as they go into daydream mode and I have to catch myself \n-Feeling weak  \n-Loss of appetite but loading up on fruits and nuts as that was the only thing my stomach can tolerate. Anything else and I would have a stomach ache and poop it out immediately. \n\n\nMy nights were a repetition of:\n\n-Profuse sweating\n-Dry mouth\n-Stomach feels like it\u2019s a hot burning furnace\n-Waking up immediately after 1-2 hours of just having fell asleep\n-A feeling of heat behind my neck and arms\n-Increased heart rate \n-Being clearly tired but unable to rest my mind and staring at closed eye lids struggling to fall asleep for hours\n\n It is now exactly 14 days later and I still cannot get a decent nights sleep. I have lost over 10 pounds. My sweating nights are over but I am still waking up an hour or so after falling asleep and cannot stay asleep. I am slowly beginning to eat more but still do not feel \"hungry\". My eye sight has gotten pretty bad, things that are not that close to me have become a slight blur I just cant focus on. Things that are in front of me are hard to focus on and things in my peripheral are a challenge to focus on as well. I am thinking negative thoughts about stressful things in my life. Seriously evaluating my stress and my job is an enormous part of it.  Everyday I have incorporated deep breathing techniques and some time for meditation but still deal with restless nights, which decreases my hope. Some days I am positive I will recover but others I lose hope because I simply cant afford to miss a day of work and rest and figure out what's going on with me.\n\nI have tried the following supplements to stay asleep:\n\n-Melatonin 5mg, 10mg\n-Benadryl\n\nI have visited the ER and the test results came back with normal results. They ran an EKG, chest and lung X-RAY, CT Scan of my head and neck and all came back normal. My next follow up appointment will dig deeper into further tests and I will continue to pursue natural recovery to get back to normal.\u00a0I am forced to continue going back to my incredibly stressful job day after day with a lack of sleep and it has been impacting my work performance significantly. My living paycheck to paycheck is slowing me down from making any more necessary appointments with psychiatrists, maybe a sleep specialist, alternative medicine practitioners, etc. It is becoming incredibly difficult to keep steam rolling through life without my mind and body intact and the fact that I cannot solve my issue quicker is because I simply can't afford to be seen by doctors that require payment upfront or natural remedies or supplements that may seem cheap to some but with someone living paycheck to paycheck it seems out of reach.\n\nThis has become a mission to recover without the use of pharmaceutical drugs, with limited time and money. I am determined to get my mind and body back and once I do, I will share any useful tips for anyone experiencing the same symptoms and who are starting to lose hope. It is very easy to lose hope and feel like you are stuck in this situation. Without love or support it makes it ten times harder."

What made me come here is what happened not even an hour ago, I accidentally fell asleep for a few hours and woke up to my parents yelling at me that my friend was outside and they didn\u2019t know why. My house is very easily made stressful, so that never helps.

The pain feels like it\u2019s in two parts, one part like it is on fire or being scrapped on sandpaper, the other a deep ache that only worsens the first.

I was Prescribed Zoloft but my mother and I collectively agreed therapy was the the best solution. \n\nAt age 10 I was prescribed singular after which I had very depressed states. My father also had suicidal thoughts after taking the medication. Once harmful effects were noticed due to the medicationI was taken off. ( I took the Medicine for about a year) \n\n\nFamily history\n\nMother - bi polar\nFather - ASPD tenancies\nOldest bother - schizophrenic (committed suicide in February)\nSecond oldest brother - diagnosed with depression and anger issues, but I believe he has the same problem as me (he sleeps with a loaded gun in his hands, I\u2019m sure that means something) \n\nMothers side \nOnly aunt is bi polar as well as my grandmother.  4/7 of my great aunts have some sort of mood disorder (not sure which) \n\nFathers side \nNo clue but there are 3 convicted murderers in his family. \n\nI don\u2019t want to be one of those people who self diagnose although I\u2019m pretty convinced this is my problem. \n\nI had a very traumatic childhood to say the least. Screaming and fighting were a weekly of not daily occurrence from my birth. I\u2019m not going to go into extreme detail but I was told I was molested by my oldest brother at the age of 2 and abused quite often (I have zero memory of this). My parents were stressed to no end with him and often neglected me to make sure he didn\u2019t do anything stupid (made murder threats often and attempted suicide multiple times from age 12 on) my second oldest brother took care of me a lot a did he best to shield me from the screaming and yelling. This went on until I was\n\nMy dad has always been calm and collected but when mad (he\u2019s only been mad a handful of times) the person on the other end of his anger has legitimately feared for their life. \n\nMy mothers mood is like a clock. She can wake you up with a kiss on the forehead but an hour later she can be crying on the floor screaming and yelling about how her so wants her to  literally die because he forgot to unload the dishwasher. She Screams on a daily basis and has my entire life. I won\u2019t go into great detail because I think you get the picture, but occasionally she would be emotionally abusive. \n\n______________________________________________\n\nI exhibit every symptom on this (list)[https://www.helpguide.org/articles/mental-disorders/borderline-personality-disorder.htm] for BPD \n\nI am going to go through them one by one with as little bias as possible. (I\u2019m well aware a lot of the things I do are absurdly stupid and make me kind of a horrible human being) \n\nFear of abandonment - This is the biggest one for me. Ive had 4 full on break downs within the past 2 weeks over my family dying or girlfriend breaking up with me. Often times this is completely unjustified and I\u2019m fine but I often act out in horrible ways. Most of the time I end up crying and having a full blown panic attack (I have chronic asthma so I often black out from these panic attacks). I can\u2019t think of a single day that the thought of someone i care for deeply dying hasn\u2019t crossed my mind. \n\nUnstable relationships - This is also a big one. My girlfriend and I have been together for a year. We have broken up 20+ times, but never more than a day. We have a great relationship. We talk for a few hours everyday, we  try to see each other at least once a week, our sex life is amazing, we are great together during almost all times. Except for the fights. We get into some very brutal fights often started by me and for an unjustified reason. I have threatened suicide multiple times with her as well as self harmed due to fights. \n\nUnclear shifting self image - for the last couple\nOf years my Hobbies have changed non stop. Everything from rose gardening to computer engineering I\u2019ve never stuck with something (other than soccer) for a few weeks. I\u2019ve been convinced I had ASPD for a long time because some people could die (whom a normal person would definitely care about) and I simply wouldn\u2019t care and that\u2019s true for some people but after my brother who treated me terribly killed himself I would have breakdowns and even blame myself for his death. Then after a diagnosis of anxiety and depression I was convinced I had that. But after really analyzing everything I\u2019m not even depressed I  just can\u2019t  control my sadness or anger and it comes on very very hard and fast, but it\u2019s always brought on by something (even if it\u2019s very minuscule) never just a chemical imbalance.  As of lately I\u2019ve just thought I have emotional issues until my girlfriend brought BPD to my attention. \n\nImpulsive behaviors - although I use cannabis occasionally i take T breaks for several or weeks out of fear of being like my drug addicted brother and ultimately killing myself. The issue for me isn\u2019t drugs it\u2019s food and social reward. I have an addiction to soda. I\u2019ve been drinking it my entire life (my parents weren\u2019t really around to tell me no when I was little). I\u2019ve attempted to quit more than 30 times since I was 10 never to be able to make it past day 3. I crave it intensely although.  I\u2019m well aware of how horrible it can be for your body. This is also and issue with all other foods. I basically eat just junk food. Chips, fried food, meats, candy etc. I play soccer and run often so I\u2019m really not that fat so it\u2019s never been an issue but I know I\u2019m extremely unhealthy because it\u2019s been two days since I\u2019ve consumed anything that came straight from the ground. I also have issues socially. I will often make completely horrifying jokes, make fun of others, lie, cheat, or embellish just to make myself laugh or feel good. \n\nSelf harm - I\u2019ve cut myself on and off for 2 years (haven\u2019t done that in a month :)) I often run till I pass out or gave myself muscle cramps to distract myself from whatever upsetting thought is bothering me. Although it\u2019s usually just giving myself a muscle cramp i do it at least once a week. I\u2019ve thought about suicide in the past but never seriously considered it or attempted it.  \n\nExtreme emotional mood swings - this is another big one. I\u2019d someone yells at me it can cause me to go into a state of complete panic. Crying, unable to breath right, muscle jerking, etc. I will without a doubt always uncontrollably cry if someone gets mad at me (probably due to my mom often saying I\u2019m a horrible child and getting mad at me on a daily basis for minuscule things.) something as small as a friend putting someone else before me can Warrant me saying that I should end the friendship. Everything bad just feels intense to me. \n\nA feeling of emptiness - I\u2019ve been desperately  searching for the meaning of life even know there really isn\u2019t one. I feel like I should have a clearly defined purpose and it bothers me a lot that I do not. \n\nExplosive anger - I do my best to never yell, but I do get very angry very fast. If someone wrongs me or upsets me I will say and think horrible things. I love my family but not a week can go buy without me thinking to myself \u201cI wish they were dead\u201d or\nsomthing along those lines. \n\nSuspicion or feeling out of touch with reality - this is yet again another big one. I Often over analyze everything and everyone. I\u2019ve been constantly looking for the sociopath who\u2019s not genuine to me and just using me. Sometimes I go as far as questioning the motives of my closest friends \u201cmaybe they really just hate me and only want to me friends with me because of a status symbol, or money, or looks,\u201d etc. sometimes I even get uncomfortable thinking that maybe even my brother would kill me, even know we are just going to Walmart. Or that constant feeling that someone around me might be about to\nKill me. I could go on. \n\nIn conclusion I\u2019m messed up and looking for an answer. I know that some states can\u2019t legally diagnose a child with certain mental illnesses. I\u2019m just looking for a \u201cyou probably have BPD\u201d or \u201cyou probably have *blank* not BPD\u201d \n\nTo anyone who read this thank you so much. Feel free to ask any questions that may help you make an accurate hypothesis."

Awaiting MRI. **Drugs**: Don't smoke, rarely drink. Only hard drug I've taken is shrooms I took a year and a half ago. **Doctors I've seen**: Primary Physician, retina specialist and neurologist.\n\nSymptoms (4 categories):\n\n1) **Positive bilateral enhanced entoptic phenomena:**\n\nIn other words: my vision is acting very strange and might be getting worse. My glasses prescription hasn't changed in the last year and a half (before symptoms).\n\nI see 7 things: **(1)** blue field entoptic phenomena very prominently (white blood cells moving in the capillaries in front of the retina of the eye), I never seen it in my life but now I see it almost everywhere. **(2)** Negative afterimages, the room literally burns into my vision, especially bright rooms. **(3)** poor night vision. **(4)** crazy amounts of floaters, **(5)** visual snow, **(6)** fluttering wisps of shadows in peripherals, **(7)** purkinje tree (I can see the blood vessels in my vision).\n\nRuled out retina detachment, a retina specialist said I have healthy retinas. This is perhaps neurological. Can it be an early sign of macular degeneration? When I jump on the trampoline I can see the shadow of my blind spot and the blood vessels sprouting out from it, and lately I feel as if I can see my macula: as if I'm looking at the afterimage after having looked into a bright light in my central vision (it's not always there).\n\nI thought maybe this was Hallucinogen Persisting Perception Disorder (HPPD) as some of these visual symptoms (not all) fit the bill. I read lamotrigine has helped visual snow disorder and HPPD sufferers and my doctor has been willing to try while I wait for my MRI. However it doesn't explain the below symptoms that also began around the same time:\n\n2) **Progressively decreased stamina/endurance -- weakness and shakiness, fatigue**\n\nTwo sub-symptoms: Occasionally I feel weakness and shakiness, sometimes after a meal. It feels like low blood sugar and passes after an hour or so, sometimes longer. The other symptoms is explained below:\n\nI used to be able to go on the elliptical with the resistance level set to 7, sometimes higher, and exercise on it for about 40 minutes. I've noticed that I'm progressively unable to meet this standard for myself anymore. Recently the level was set to 1 and I was still shaky and weak after 15 minutes and felt horrible and weak afterwards -- I ended up sleeping right afterwards. I feel this weakness especially in my upper torso and head, like in the muscles.\n\nDoctor did a bunch of blood tests (thyroid, diabetes, hypoglycemia, STIs) and they came back fine. I even had a ultrasound done on my stomach region, all unremarkable. These tests were early into my symptoms (like two months from initially noticing) is it possible that I got certain tests too early to detect something? Should I ask to get certain tests redone now that 9 months have passed from initial symptoms?\n\n**3) Louder/harder heart beats, occasional skipped beats**\n\nI got a ECG done. This is one of those situations where I know my body best: I've never heard or felt my heart this loudly before in my head and neck and feet. It started 6 months ago and my diastolic blood pressure has been rising steadily these past months (I think my diastolic is at 140-ish as of this month, it was normal a couple months ago and my doctor said it could be stress -- I'm not dying of stress though, I am concerned and taking this all seriously but I'm not a wreck).\n\n**4) Migraines**\n\nCrown of head, temples, behind eye to back of head. Sometimes it feels like a cold burn from the nape of my head to the top of my head.  Otherwise I'd describe the pain as pressure and an ache.\n\n**Ending Notes**\n\nI have no diagnoses. The last thing appears to be an MRI which will be in November. It feels like my life has changed. I want to lose weight but I can't without the weakness, so I've been changing my diet to something healthier. My vision worries me. I see these changes in my body and have no idea what's going on.\n\nI'll mention some of the questions I had throughout this post: Can some of my vision issues be an early indicator for macular degeneration? Or if the retina specialist says they're healthy, they're healthy? Should I ask for certain tests to be redone now that so many months have passed?"

I have been suffering from frequent migraines/headaches since i was about 14 years old. My mother had really bad migraines so i guess i do too. I began drinking coffee daily, and noticed if i didn\u2019t drink it, my head would hurt so bad later. \n\nEven when i made sure to drink coffee my head still hurt. Which was then caused by not enough water, not enough sleep, or not eating. But now i have noticed that whenever i drink alcohol, my head begins to hurt a short while after. I don\u2019t drink often due to this but i used to drink a good amount on weekends since i turned 21 this year (not to excessive). \n\nIts not even a specific type of alcohol that causes this. It seems to be all. I have tried drinking beer, even ones with less %, ciders, even wine. It feels like any type of alcohol even a few sips in, makes my head hurt. I\u2019m not sure why or what to do about this. I also drink gallons and gallons of water a day, especially when i plan on drinking. So at this point i\u2019m not too sure what\u2019s going on in my body. Even if i don\u2019t drink my head hurts from minor things. I feel like i can\u2019t enjoy my life due to little things triggering my head to hurt. BUT i have noticed that alcohol definitely is a more recent trigger and it makes me kind of sad because i want to be able to enjoy drinking sometimes, without my head throbbing for the rest of the day.\n\n\nIf y\u2019all have any advice or how i should proceed, i\u2019d appreciate it.\n\nTl;dr My head always hurts as soon as i take a few sips of alcohol, idk what to do"

Coming from an Asian country, I naturally used to eat a lot of carb but since I was a teenager, I noticed that I felt very lightheaded, slightly dizzy, with racing heartbeat after every lunch. I felt bad after dinner, too but I got to relax at home so I don't mind as much. Other things are although I never ate a lot, I would experience weight gain, acne, inflammations, and anxiety.\n\nWhen I started college and moved to Seattle, I started off this low carb diet (unintentionally at first because I was lazy), I noticed I don't feel anything wrong after eating at all. But I do get back to carb every now and then because it's a cheaper diet but my symptoms are getting worse every I eat. I cut down on ice cream, junk food, and replace them with fruits. Everything I eat during the day is stuffs I cook. \n\n I had a seafood pasta night with my boyfriend last week and I could feel that my stomach was not digesting the pasta at all. I didn't have more than a plate but I also had some sugary alcohol drinks. After a while, I still felt uncomfortably full and decided to throw up. \n\nIve been eating my low carb diet and feel fine even after a big meal of veggies and beef. I eat more healthy fat like avocado, coconut oil, etc. But Then we wanted some Taco Bell (nacho, taco, burrito, and black coffee, they're $1 items so they're tiny but I couldn't finish half of them before started feeling sick) last night and we took walks to run errands, after a few hours, I started to feel headache, dizzy, lightheaded, and weak in my hands and feet. Anxiety is sparkling up as well. I had to lie down and get sleep. I Just woke up and it's been over 12 hours and I still feel kind of sick and anxious with faster heart beat. I even still feel like throwing up.\n\nWhat could be the causes of my worsening symptoms after eating carbs? Thanks very much, Docs!\n\n\nEdit: I wanted to specify what kind of carb would make feel worse. Rice, pasta, bread are instant regrets. Desserts, sugary drinks, etc. Weight gain, acne, cravings."

        "reddit": "I posted this in r/pcos but someone suggested posting here. Using a throwaway account, this is a bit embarrassing (I previously used this throwaway to talk about my garbage father, hence the username). I\u2019m currently in Colombia teaching English. A few weekends ago, I traveled to another city. Where I am, in the mountains, it\u2019s quite cool on a daily basis whereas the city I traveled to was hot. On the last day of being in said city, I noticed two red bumps at the top of where my bottom starts (essentially the top of my crack, for lack of a better, more scientific term). They were itchy but I figured it was just from the heat and my clothes rubbing my skin. They essentially looked like mosquito bites.\n\nFast forward to a week or so later and I\u2019ve got an itchy bump on my vagina and I also notice a pimple-ish looking sore on my inner labia. It pretty much looked like a pimple with the white head in there pretty deep. No big deal, I\u2019ve had bumps before and they\u2019ve gone away on their own, though I was a bit concerned about the sore on my inner labia. Next day I am a little more irritated and very itchy. I had at least 5 bumps now. The next day, I am literally covered in these bumps and sores in the folds of my vagina, anus, and butt (essentially looks like someone burned me with a cigarette several times). My perineum looked and felt like someone took a knife to it, covered in painful open tears and I also had discharge: White and watery at first but then had the cottage cheese look and when I cleaned, there was a bit of green \u201cooze\u201d that looked like tiny, tiny snot dots. The sores spread to my anus (more like on the side) and top of my crack. \n\nAt first, I thought it might just be a really bad yeast infection but this was all incredibly painful. I did go to the doctor but it was difficult to communicate since I have limited Spanish and I am not in an area where anyone speaks English. But I translated everything I could think of before I left and wrote it on a piece of paper. My throat had also been hurting and I had some pain on my lower sides, nausea, as well as a lot of gas. The doctor said I had a throat infection, I asked if it was strep and he basically said maybe. Then he said I had an infection of the ovaries; he did look at my vagina, though admittedly not very thoroughly, and felt around on my abdomen. I asked if my throat and ovaries were related and he said no. He prescribed me some anti-fungal tablets I inserted vaginally as well as cream I inserted vaginally with an applicator at night. He was pretty vague about everything, maybe because of the language barrier. I have one more dose of each and these sores are still there, though significantly better. The tears on my perineum are still pretty painful, though. They\u2019ve gotten better but still making life difficult. At first, I literally couldn\u2019t even walk or sit down without being in pain. And going to the bathroom, I almost vomited from the pain and was very pale. I\u2019m making sure to wash and keep everything clean, going to the bathroom to dab and get rid of the oozey stuff as often as I can and using pads to catch any icky stuff.\n\nWhen I looked it up, it said infection of the ovaries = pelvic inflammatory disease which is usually caused by gonorrea or chlamydia but that\u2019s...literally impossible. I did read normal bacteria could cause PID as well, though. \n\nHowever I\u2019m afraid it\u2019s something more. My symptoms seem to be anything from herpes to a bad yeast infection to PID to pinworms. Just wondering if anyone else has experienced anything like this? I am getting better but it has been an incredibly slow process and I\u2019m worried it might be something more. I am returning home in less than a week, though I won\u2019t have insurance for a while but I\u2019m planning on going to planned parenthood or something just to get it checked out again. \n\nI do have PCOS as well as fibromyalgia if that matters.\n\nLe sigh.

I had to hold myself up with different things like the nightstand, door, railing in hallway because my legs were weak and unable to hold me up on their own. I woke up this morning and I feel okay again. Should I just brush it off as another wacky ME symptom or is this something I should see a doctor about?

Constant. It started out as being diagnosed as hemorrhoids. I initially used topical creams to try to rid them, which only provided temporary relied. I then went to a specialist who performed laser therapy inside my rectum to try to shrink some internal hemorrhoids I may have had causing the itching and irritation. I went through 3 laser treatments and still the itching persisted. This doctor then sent me to an anorectal specialist who did an exam and told me that I had a condition called Pruritus Ani and that it\u2019s chronic and I\u2019d have to watch my diet and soaps I use and types of underwear I wear..etc. This was in early 2013- since then I have stayed away from washing the area with soap. Tried different creams such as Pranicura and calmoseptine. Stopped using textured toilet paper. It goes on and off and has basically been a 7-8 year period of suffering, itching, bleeding after bowel movements due to irritated anal tissue, painful bowel movements. \n\nAround 2014, I stared having similar itching issues on the tissue around my clitoral hood and Vulva as well as the skin between my buttocks. It resulted in redness, itching, peeling, flaking, and bleeding due to irritation. I have been to several gynecologist\u2019s regarding the vulval itching and every time have been diagnosed with yeast infections and given nitrate creams and diflucan to clear it up. It seems to work but again only temporarily. I also went to my primary care doctor about the irritated skin between my buttocks and was given an anti fungal cream, which again worked but only temporarily. All of these issues have continually come back on and off since they started and have lead me to have more anxiety and depression due to being very frustrated-trying so many things and nothing working, and being overall extremely uncomfortable for years on end. \n\nI just went for my annual exam with my gyno 2 Friday\u2019s ago. She took a swab of some discharge and looked at it under a scope and diagnosed me with yet again another yeast infection. I told her about the vulvar itching/irritation and extreme uncomfortableness of it. She prescribed me 2 doses of diflucan to take over a week period and monistat 7 day to clear it up. Last Friday, I took my final dose of diflucan and finished my 7th day of monistat and have continued to apply the nitrate cream to the external irritated vulva areas as recommended by the gynecologist. The internal itching has stopped but external itching, redness, and irritation has continued and actually re-manifested on the opposite side of where it was originally was bothering me. I haven\u2019t had the irritation in this area in about a year until now. \n\nAround the time I was 12, I developed a circular shaped rash on the back of my neck that scaled and itched. I had it biopsied by a dermatologist who told me it was psoriasis. Since then I have had several areas of skin irritation, flaking, itching including my entire scalp, inner ears, and random patches here and there. I have gone back to several dermatologists who have told that they don\u2019t think these areas are Psoriasis but rather a mixture  seborrheic dermatitis  and eczema. I honestly don\u2019t know what to believe but this has been another extremely frustrating and what seems to be chronic issue that I can\u2019t get a solid diagnosis on. \n\nI\u2019m starting to wonder, could one of these skin conditions been what\u2019s causing the nonstop irritation and itching on my genitals? I tried to ask my gyno this question when I was at my appointment and she said most likely not and that after all her years of being in the field she\u2019s ever seen these conditions come about in the genital areas. I emailed her yesterday in concern of the issue not being resolved and she told me to try monistat 7 day again in a weeks time and if it does not clear up by then, to come back in and have the area biopsied. Again I\u2019m left totally frustrated and uncomfortable. I\u2019m newly married and needless to say this has pretty much ruined my sex life and libido on and off for years but especially now. \n\nAt this point, I\u2019m desperate for some help. I\u2019m tired of going through uncomfortable treatments and procedures, having to go to multiple doctors for uncomfortable and awkward appointments, being told the same things over and over again, trying treatment after treatment and getting my hopes up to no avail. Any ideas or thoughts from a doctor would be greatly appreciated. If any other details are needed that I left out, please let me know. Please help."

The cough has been phlegmy and I have had to hack up mucus all the time. For the first month of two I also had a stuffed nose with it but at this point that has faded. As well, for about a month during this period my ears would be plugged and I couldn't hear anything until my ear would pop. I would be able to hear for a bit then it would go back to being plugged. Also, for a while the cough was very rattly and wheezy in my chest. The wheezing symptom also only last around a month. \n\nAt first I thought it was allergies so I have been using my nasacort every morning but it didn't go away. I went to the doctor and she thought it was a chest cold so she gave me an inhaler (advair). I used the inhaler once a day for 2 weeks and that didn't help at all so I went back to the doctor. The second time I went she thought it was a sinus infection since I had this horrible cough for 3 weeks. She put me on Amoxicillin and I took the prescribed dosage of taking 1 pill 3 time a day  (30 tablets) until it was finished and nothing changed. Then I went back and she thinks I have a viral infection so at this point she told me there's not much she can do so she prescribed me more advair. I now have been inhaling the advair in the morning and at night as well as using my nasacort in the morning and at night as well. Using the advair more often seemed to help my cough subside. I used the entire inhaler (50 uses) and now that it is done my cough is fully back. I have been having coughing fits in the middle in the night so I have been unable to sleep. I still get many coughing attacks during the day, typically while at work but for some reason not as much outside of work. I'm getting very concerned because this so called viral infection has not gone away at all. From what I have looked up it seems like a viral infection should not last this long. I want to go get a physical done as my family has a history of heart disease and I have heard stories like mine where someone ends up having a heart attack. I'm young so I feel like I'm being paranoid thinking it's heart related but many close family members of mine have had many blood related issues in the past. For example, my cousin had leukaemia and my father had a huge blood clot and was a day away from a massive heart attack.\n\nAlso before all of this started happening some doctors thought I had rheumatoid arthritis. I was having extreme joint pain for a month and a half. I went and got a full body x-ray done and nothing was found other than low bone density in my hands. They found I had low iron but I have also had this in the past as well. The low iron was only a little below what it should be. I eventually went to a rheumatologist and they concluded that I do not have any kind of arthtrits and they believe that was also a viral infection. Around the time my joints stopped hurting this cough started so I am adding this because I am not sure if these things could be related at all.\n\nI currently take bupropion every morning for my depression. Other than low iron and depression I do not have any other medical conditions. I used to smoke a lot but for the past 3 months I have not smoked at all.\n\nI am not sure if immediate action needs to be taken or if it is just a viral infection that has lingered. Does any of this sound heart disease related and should I be concerned about that?\n\nThank you so much in advance for helping me out!"

Also I am prescribed vyvanse and adderall and although I know those can cause nervousness these symptoms have been present long before I have been taking this. Sleeping problems also run in my family. Every time I have a symptom I try to write it down so here is what they are. During the day I almost always have a underlying feeling of off edgeness  and the feeling that something is going wrong that I need to pay attention to. I get extreme social anxiety, to the point that in class I will never raise my hand and during seminars I choose to not talk and get a zero even though I really care about my grades and have only made 3 non A grades out of 16 classes. I am not diagnosed for this but I also know that I suffer from depression. But these are the best negative symptoms because at night the anxiety turns to panics. When trying to sleep I get this feeling that I\u2019m not breathing enough to the point that I have a fan within a feet of my face constantly blowing to the point I wake up in the morning with a cold. I absolutely cannot sleep without a fan despite the most ideal conditions for this reason. This typically puts me into a sort of panic where I am extremely chlosterphobic and get hot, get sweats and a fast heart beat which all ends up leading to insomnia where I either get very little sleep or none at all. None of these symptoms are due to my other prescriptions except maybe the depression from the come off so I don\u2019t want my doctor to think that\u2019s the problem and take me off it. Both my parents can also vouch for this as there has been countless nights where I have went in there room crying from exhaustion at 4 am."

The cut isn\u2019t exactly huge but it\u2019s definitely big enough that i would\u2019ve felt it if i just randomly got scratched out of nowhere so Im pretty damn sure i scraped myself while helping my family move in, but i\u2019m obsessed with the what if. Ive started to feel some tingling in my leg now which is a symptom of rabies and it\u2019s sort of around my whole leg below my knee, toes, and right arm as well, like a nerve pain. i\u2019ve had that kind of shooting nerve pain feeling before now and have been told it\u2019s most likely anxiety. i\u2019m almost certain it\u2019s anxiety but i just want to be sure. i posted the pic to the batty sub and one person responded saying north american bats don\u2019t have big enough claws for that kind of wound, which makes sense as the bat was quite small, not to mention the fact that their wing claws are only a couple inches away from their body and are used for grappling \n\nCould this be rabies?? Like I know it\u2019s a huge stretch (is it?) but i\u2019m feeling it on the same side and I don\u2019t know what else it could be except maybe anxiety?"

        "reddit": "33yo female, 5'10\", 195 lb, non-smoker, consume maybe 1 drink a month, no recreational drug use ever\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have now had 3 major episodes of sudden headache/dizzines. Once in April, and twice in the last 2 weeks.\n\nFIRST EPISODE: In April, I had a sudden attack of (what I was told was) vertigo that lasted over an hour. I went to the ER at the recommendation of a family friend who is an LPN when I told her that I was also experiencing tingling in my hands and a horizontal nystagmus. When the symptoms started, I had just eaten lunch (nothing I am allergic to - I had comprehensive allergy testing done last year while working to treat anxiety), and as I walked back to my desk, I was hit with severe dizziness out of nowhere. No headache this time - just room spinning (even when my eyes were closed, I still physically felt like I was spinning). I barely made it down the stairs and back to my desk. (side note: we were trying to sell a property, and I was generally stressed the entire month of April)\n\nI was originally diagnosed with BPPV by the ER doc, and prescribe Valium and Meclizine for use PRN. But when I was referred to an ENT, he did a bunch of tilt-table tests and said that I definitely do NOT have BPPV. He suggested cutting out caffeine and reducing stress. I did both the best I could, and symptoms improved. I had a couple more unremarkable episodes of dizziness/headaches in May, but nothing like what sent me to the ER.\n\nIn June, my PCP  and I started working to find an anti-anxiety medication. I tried Lexapro (10mg) for a couple of weeks (discontinued because it made me feel numb and I also experienced sexual disfunction). Then we tried Buspar (I forget the dosage, sorry), which made me a little dizzy (not vertigo, just a little unsteady and unsafe to drive). We discontinued it after a week (first week of July). We tried Hydroxyzine next (50mg). I took it one time on Sunday July 21st @ 9pm. It made me absurdly \"drunk,\" and I felt gross the next morning, like I had a hangover.\n\nSECOND EPISODE: On Monday, July 22nd at 2pm, again after lunch (different meal; again - no allergens), I felt a sudden headache like a tight \"band\" around the back of my head. I laid down in the floor in a conference room, and had my husband check on me 10 minutes later (we work together). When he checked on me, I couldn't have told you if it had been 10 minutes or an hour since I laid down. I had no sense of time. My vision was swimming a bit, but I did not feel like I was spinning this time. I felt like nothing was real. Like, logically I knew that my husband was sitting on the floor talking to me, but spatially, I felt like he (and I) didn't exist. He had me call my PCP's office to ask if I could take either valium or meclizine after having taken the hydroxyzine the night before. I felt like I was making no sense when I talked to the nurse, but my husband says that I had a perfectly coherent conversation. I went home, took valium, and went to bed. (side note: I found out that my little brother-in-law might go to prison that morning)\n\nTHIRD EPISODE: On Saturday, July 27th, while out shopping with my family, I had another sudden round of a \"band\" headache and dizziness. I had only taken my CBD oil that morning (probably 3 hrs before) and nothing else. I was walking down an aisle, and in the time it took me to walk 30 feet from one end of the aisle to the other, I had to grab a rack to keep myself steady. MY husband walked me to the car, and within a few minutes, I felt like I was spinning. I took meclizine (it happened to be in my purse), and the spinning stopped, but I had pins and needles in the left side of my face and a headache until I got home and went to bed. (side note: I had an argument with my husband that morning)\n\nMy PCP has said she does not think these are migraines, given how fast they come on and the fact that I do **not** have these classic migraine symptoms: aura, light/sound sensitivity, nausea/vomiting, throbbing/pulsing pain\n\nI have not hit my head.\n\nWhen these symptoms start, I am not overly stressed/anxious in the moment.\n\nI do not have a family history of migraines, neurological disorders, or MS (doc asked that question)\n\nMy PCP is referring me to a neurologist, but I don't have anything scheduled yet.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Current meds:**\n\nOrtho Molecular Products \"Cerenity\" (multivitamin targeted for anxiety) - 3 capsules SID\n\nReacted Magnesium - 235 mg SID\n\nReacted Iron - 30 mg SID\n\nCBD oil - 60mg SID, PRN\n\nPepcid PRN\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Unrelated (?) diagnoses/surgeries/misc**:\n\nAnxiety (deep family history)\n\nOccasional tension headaches (manifest as neck muscle pain - have seen chiropractor for neck adjustments \\[PCP approved\\], which helps alleviate symptoms)\n\nGERD\n\nVertical Sleeve Gastrectomy in 2013\n\nCholecystectomy in 2014\n\nI have a Paraguard copper IUD - since 2016\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSelf-diagnosis: I'm beginning to wonder if these are panic attacks...

If you get through this, thank you! \n\nI have a few different medical conditions (listed below) but the issue I am seeking advice for is my gastrointestinal one (which I suspect is IBS). For the past couple of years, it's seemed like I've been constantly struggling using the bathroom; I'm either suffering from prolonged constipated or having the random, occasional bout of diarrhea. The only time my stool seems to look normal (according to the Bristol stool chart?) is when I've been taking my probiotic supplement, but even then, sometimes I just end up passing the same pebbles/lumpy log just...with more color?\n\nFrom my research online and the check-ins I've had with various doctors, I know laxatives are not the healthiest things. I know that they can cause more constipation long term and that I should just increase my fibre and water intake, but even when I started eating exclusively fruits and vegetables (to regain control of my diet after more recently developing binge-eating disorder), the bathroom is still a struggle! Just yesterday, I felt like I needed to go number 2 all day but couldn't. This might be strange but I also think my body isn't really retaining the extra water I am drinking. If I drink a glass of water I will seriously need to pee like 30 minutes later. I must need to pee around 10 times a day but am embarrassed to say I can and have often gone multiple days without pooping. \n\nAt this point, I am just frustrated. I want to clear myself out and fast, so I'm asking what would be the best type and strength of laxative as well as how frequently I should take it as someone who wants to minimize the damage it could cause? \n\nOh, and I was prescribed Docusate sodium in the past and can't remember much about it, just that its effects (if they even happened) didn't seem immediate? \n\n**Info:**\n\n- Age: early 20s\n- Sex: female\n- Height: 5'2\"\n- Healthy baseline weight (pre-BED): 100 lbs\n- Current weight: 170 lbs \n- Race: arab\n- Duration of complaint: not sure, 3+ years at least\n- Location: Canada\n- Existing medical issues: anxiety and depression (have struggled for 10 years), binge-eating disorder (developed 2 years ago)\n- Medications: Sertraline (over a year), Wellbutrin XL (over a year), Risperdal (over a month)\n\nAny input would be appreciated."

I googled twitching and instantly feared I had als and the twitching went body wide. About a month into the twitching I started getting random muscle pain and joint pain in multiple locations. I would also get heart palpitations and some light cramping in various locations. I wouldn't really even consider them cramps. Also I'd get what felt like internal tremors in both of my feet. \n\nNow 4 months in things are more calm as I've calmed my stress/anxiety. I still get twitching but seems much less and I also get some of those other symptoms too but very infrequently. I just started getting what seems like hot flashes now. Every morning after I'm out of bed moving around I'll lose my breath, my face gets real hot and itchy like, and my legs feel real heavy. This lasts only about 10 seconds then doesn't occur again until the next morning. Also I have gotten slight constipation within the last month. \n\nI've had multiple blood tests checking loads of stuff and everything has came back clean. Only thing slightly elevated was my creatinine levels but I take creatine as a supplement so that could be the reason. I've also had a brain MRI and lumbar MRI which were both fine. \n\nStress definitely plays a factor with my twitching as I've noticed when I get real stressed the twitching increases. Lifting weights also increases my twitches. I'd chalk all this up to stress but I've felt pretty calm the past month and I'm still getting new symptoms so I'm very confused.\n\nI have an appointment with a neurologist at the end of this month so hopefully that gives me some answers. I feel like this might be a hormonal problem because that's the only thing I haven't had checked. My whole body seems to be affected so that would make sense. \n\nHopefully one of you might know what could be going on or give me some insight as what I should do next. Thanks."

I run out a week early every morning and put myself through the worst withdrawals ever because I'm so depressed it's the only thing I can do to keep going. If I had a job I'd buy them, I was my best on Roxys or op80s. But it's been 10 years, and I don't know how to stop.

I'm scared I'm not going to be around much longer, I think of death daily and takes hours to go to sleep from it. I've been to the er three times in the past year.

I won't say the job because I shouldn't have taken them on it, but I never got \"high\". Until I got home and would take up to 10 of them, 5mg worth and just lay down and pass in and out, because I didn't want to be in control of my thoughts.\n\nSorry for the tangent. I know I need rehab, but I also really need to find out what's causing my weight loss and sickness. I tried to stop smoking mj for 2 weeks to see if I was dependent on it, and I wasn't. Going back just allowed me to eat again. My doctor said that if I'm getting it safe and it helps me, by all means continue to do so until he can figure out what is wrong.

So I feel terrible and am freaking out right now because this situation is giving me extreme anxiety.\n\nSo my nephew was drinking water out of a sippy cup(purchased water) and then the sippy cup fell on the floor. When I picked it up for him, I noticed that the tip of the sippy cup had all sorts of dirt/food on it so I decided to give it a quick rinse. I rinsed it under the sink for less than like four seconds and I did not dry the tip off. I gave the sippy cup back to my nephew and he took a small sip or two. HOWEVER, it had totally slipped my mind that my sister-in-law had mentioned the water in the town had been tested positive for E. Coli (I don't live in their town). So when I heard them talking about it, I freaked out and told her and my brother. My brother said he should be fine because it's not like the baby drank the water, since it was only droplets on the tip (inside of his sippy cup was bottled water) and my sister-in-law wasn't necessarily mad at me but she had a bit of mom anxiety and I saw her searching it up on her phone. Please tell me your thoughts and opinions and please be nice as I am only 16 years-old. Will my nephew be okay??"

He is a non-smoker and non-drinker. \n\nFor the past 3 days my father's urine has had an Amber color. We went to the emergency room today and the urinalysis came back normal. There were no traces of blood and the bilirubin count was 0. The PA said she had no idea what could be causing it. She recommended to set an appointment with his PCP. \n\nMEDICAL HISTORY: \n My father has had hypertension for up to 5 years now. He was prescribed METOPROLOL and Amlodipine. \n\nFive months ago he had has gallbladder removed. During removal they performed a biopsy on his liver. The biopsy showed stage 3 liver disease likely caused from fatty liver since he does not drink. \n\nA month and a half ago he had a CT scan that showed a mass on his kidney. A follow-up CT scan was scheduled as the mass could not be identified. My father has yet to have the second scan. \n\nI'm concerned that the urine test was botched. \nHowever if that is not the case, what could be causing the discoloration? \n\nLastly, he has no pain when urinating, but does have an enlarged prostate. When he urinates it trickles out. He hasn't been prescribed any medication for his prostate because he had an allergic reaction to flomax -- it caused his heart rate to sky rocket when resting. \n\nThank you very much for reading this all of this. I appreciate any and all help. \n\nIf there's any other information I can provide please let me know.\n\nEDIT: I forgot to mention that he has not had anything in his diet recently that would explain the color change. He also drinks plenty of water."

I have asked my doctor about it and she gives me a blank stare every time I ask, as it\u2019s unrelated to GERD and eating. I am a nurse and I realized that there may be something underlying and more major than just simple nausea and vomiting. Typically when this happens to me I\u2019m sleeping, but it also happens to me at work, in the car, and just in random scenarios. There is nothing that is a precursor to the vomiting such as eating. \n\nWhat happens: If asleep, I wake up and I get a very strange feeling. I began having odd thoughts, and flashbacks to different times in my life and my whole body freezes and I\u2019m unable to speak. I then begin vomiting and when I stop, I am finally able to move and speak. I don\u2019t know how to explain it more than that. When people have been around me when it happens, they tell me they are unable to get my attention and I stare off and give no reaction at all. \n\nThis worries me because I am starting to wonder if it is seizure activity. Not epilepsy, obviously, but partial seizures. If anyone has seen this or knows of anything it could be/what could help please let me know!

        "reddit": "Hi. I _think_ this is the best sub to post this, but if it isn\u2019t and anybody knows a sub where I could be directed, that would be terrific.\n\nSo I am on vacation in LA with a friend. Today we hiked a trail that leads to the Hollywood sign and it was incredibly vigorous and steep and super hot out. I didn\u2019t have any trouble with it, but my friend dropped out rather quickly and the person I had met and continued on with gave up after we reached what is like the first milestone point of the hike. Anyways, i ran out of water pretty quickly. But I was fine. I wasn't dehydrated, but I was thirsty. But it was fine. After I got to the top and looked at the Hollywood sign, I didn\u2019t want to hike all the way down the path I came, so I basically walked down these windy residential streets. So I had an empty plastic water bottle with me bc I had finished the water a long time ago. And so I'm walking down these residential streets (though it's pretty secluded and private and quiet cuz it's in the hills and stuff) and I notice at one house there's like this weird concrete thing on the side of the wall and it has like 3 holes and like metal valves and stuff that water is coming out of. So there's like these three very small (but constant, it wasn\u2019t like the water was just dripping) streams of water and then all the water like built up in this dirty puddle in some concrete thing underneath. I'm pretty sure it wasn't a waterfall kind of design thing. In fact, there's no way it could've been cuz it was a bougie area. But I was dumb, and I knew I was being dumb AS I DECIDED TO DO THIS (lol), but I like,,, consciously did it anyways (sigh, I\u2019m a moron ik) I stick my waterbottle underneath one of the valves that waters coming out of and fill it up a tiny bit and it's yellow in my bottle but I drink it anyways. This was only a gulp. It was warmish. It didn\u2019t taste like drinking water obviously, but it didn\u2019t taste super dissimilar from like lake water I guess? And then I fill it up some more in the middle valve, and I take a rather large few gulps. Then I continue walking down and it just strikes me how yellow this water is... so I dump what you see in the picture (see below) on the ground and like a bit on my body but idrc ab that. \n\nSo I\u2019m SUUUPER paranoid and literally hate myself for doing this cuz I knew it was stupid and I did it anyways... I literally don\u2019t know ANYTHING about houses or plumbing or sewers or pipes or anything like that so idk if this was some sewer water or what else it was or might\u2019ve been. Idk if there were toxins or like some poisonous or bacterial or unhealthy stuff in it. I feel like it must've been unhealthy. Like maybe it was from their toilet (idk if that's a thing, idk anything ab pluming), I'm just suuuper scared now. Should I go to the hospital and have what I drank like taken out of me or my stomach pumped before it hypothetically destroys me body? This happened at 3:58PM California time and it\u2019s now 8: PM California time. It might be because I\u2019m paranoid and bc I\u2019m human that I like started to maybe feel a little stomach ache or a little headache. My stomach now hurts but it\u2019s the same feeling I have when I\u2019m hungry so that\u2019s probably what it is because I haven\u2019t eaten since breakfast. \n\nAlso, what if the pipes that the water was coming out of were rusty or something??? Aren't rust and cancer related?? I'm freaking out. Idk if there was lead in the water or even worse stuff. I know this sounds so stupid and this entire thing was obviously self inflicted, but I\u2019m suuuper paranoid. \n\n[the water was lukewarm and yellow](https://imgur.com/gallery/nGfUYFE) \nI\u2019d already had two gulps when this picture was taken and at this point I was freaked out and just dumped what was in the picture out onto the sidewalk and a little on my body just cuz I was hot and sweaty (I doubt that\u2019s an issue).\n\nBasic info on me is that I\u2019m 19, female, 4\u201910\u201d, ~112 lbs, I don\u2019t think location on body is relevant..., incident happened at around 3:58PM California time. It is currently around 8PM California time. \n\nMedical issues... most aren\u2019t anything major or probably even relevant but I want to be as cautious as possible. Clinical debilitating anxiety, clinical depression, very minor scoliosis, some very run of the mill allergies (penicillin, amoxicillin, pollen, a bunch of fruits that relate to that pollen allergy), it\u2019s not really a condition, but I had a kidney stone when I was 17. All the women in my family have had lots of them. I have at least 3 more stones harvesting in there, but nothing has happened with those. \n\n__Also, there was a bat in my house (which I never saw, but we don\u2019t know how long it was there) exactly two weeks ago, and my family and I are being overcautious and getting the rabies vaccination. So far I\u2019ve had 3 out of the 4 rounds of shots.\n\nMeds I take daily: Vyvance (40mg), Fluoxetine (40mg), Bupropion (300mg)\n\nTLDR; I drank some dirty water out of some small metal pipes sticking out of a house I walked past. I\u2019m petrified"

I have been using fiber supplements for my entire life pretty much , and my parents and I refer to it as \u201cmedicine\u201d.\n\nI remember 2 times when I had mega-poo, where I held it in for over 6 months,those were the scariest moment of my life, I don\u2019t even wanna think about it.\n\nFast forward to maybe a year or to ago and I entered a time period  where I would poo every time I shower and it would be so damn hard that one time I believe the doctor said that I popped the veins in my face or something so it looked like chicken pox that even my friends pointed it out. I don\u2019t know how long ago it was, but my family and I went on a vacation, and I held in my poo because I was afraid.. since then I have been pooping every week or two, using a special, probably unhealthy tactic. I would wait for around a week after I pooped, and then start using fiber supplements like there\u2019s no tomorrow, sometimes I would also eat nuts as well. If this fiber supplement I\u2019m talking about said that 1-2 doses between 12 hours is good then I would take 3-4 doses in the span of 4-6 hours to induce diarrhea. It would explode relatively easily but would be quite painful.\n\nIn my country you have to enlist in the army at age 18, and I can\u2019t handle it anymore, I\u2019ve been seriously considering suicide, using a gun I might get in the army.\n\nSorry that this is so long but not even my parents know the extent of my problem , they just think I hold it in sometimes. This is basically my life story.\n\nFacts about myself that might be useful:\n\nI am a picky eater, the only fruits and vegetables I eat are bananas (every 2-3 months) and corn (once in a blue moon) respectively. I mostly eat pasta,pizza,salmon,chicken,rice, bread, other unhealthy stuff as well.\n\nI love candy, like seriously love candy. If there is a bar of chocolate in the fridge, there isn\u2019t one.\nMy parents barely get any though, so I don\u2019t have diabetes. I don\u2019t drink anything other than water, milk and maybe apple juice occasionally.\n\nIf you have any questions, please ask!! Nobody else knows about this and I\u2019m genuinely scared by this lifestyle but I\u2019m a lazy PoS..\n\nThank you for reading.\n\nEdit: Might be worth mentioning I sit on my ass all day cause I never go out with friends."

I\u2019m posting this to reddit on my boyfriend\u2019s account in the hope that people will listen to and respond directly to my concerns and tell me if I am overthinking everything or if I should perhaps push for imaging or other investigative procedures.     \n\nFor the last six months I have been suffering recurrent upper respiratory infections, almost constantly. I don\u2019t really know if they were \u201cinfections,\u201d but each time I went to urgent care they would prescribe me steroids and occasionally antibiotics. Symptoms (particularly in the most recent infection at the end of July 2019) included many mouth ulcers that seemed like canker sores, and spitting up blood from what seemed like the back of my throat just below the mouth area. I would also occasionally get extremely lightheaded to the point of having to immediately sit on the ground (and once entirely fainted) after standing up too quickly, in a way that is way worse than the usual headrush. I went to a primary care physician and tested negative for mono, so she ordered a blood panel.    \n\nThe next day my doctor called me back and said that a repeat test was needed due to an extremely high platelet count of 757000 per microliter. My total lymphocyte count was somewhat high at 4000 per microliter. The blood test taken the next day confirmed these results. Additional information uncovered by the blood panels includes a high titer (1:160) detection of Nucleolar Pattern Antinuclear Antibodies and a mildly high Blood Urea Nitrogen count of 23 mg/dL. Total cholesterol was also very slightly high at 244 mg/dL. Check out the imgur link at the top if you want to look through everything for yourself so you can pick out the important bits in case I have left out anything.    \n\nSo here is where my concerns really start coming to a head. The doctor told me that my bloodwork strongly indicated scleroderma, with lupus as a potential differential diagnosis. My family history of lupus makes this seem pretty reasonable, but I have never had a skin rash that is indicative of scleroderma, so I\u2019m pretty reluctant to agree with the doctors opinion on that point. Additionally, not everything in the bloodwork is traditionally indicative of either of those autoimmune disorders. Internet research and a story about a friend\u2019s roommate (the last thing that you want to hear a patient say, I know) has led me to fear that I might actually be suffering from a undetected malignancy like a type of slow growing lymphoma, as my lymph nodes in my neck, arm pits, and groin have been swollen and occasionally painful for almost as long as I can remember. Additionally, the high platelet and white blood cell counts have pushed me in this direction while researching. I\u2019ve even read that lupus can mimic lymphoma and may be associated with a higher risk of developing the disease, but I also don\u2019t feel like I suffer from many of the more traditional lupus symptoms.     \n\nI know that the last paragraph really makes a lot of logical jumps, but I\u2019ve found it impossible to kick these thoughts from my head and have come here to see what you all think. I really greatly appreciate any advice and am looking forward to reading your responses."

        "reddit": "Hi everyone. I was referred here from r/medical, and have been trying every appropriate subreddit I can because internet searches haven't addressed my particular condition. \n\nSo earlier this past week I got results from an ultrasound I unfortunately had to take because of a bulge I've seen during some excersizes that go beyond my fat gut (currently overweight, at around 235 pounds at 5'7\"-5'8\"),which prompted me to schedule the ultrasound last Friday.\n\nI got the results of it earlier this week, and I was told that I have Rectus abdominis diastases, aka \"abdominal separation\", and the ultrasound report said it was a 1.7cm separation.\n\nI am a 33 year old male, and as I mentioned I'm around 235 pounds and between 5'7\"-5'8\". I have heard that this condition can be hereditary, which I'm worried about because my dad had this condition once before his multiple hernias, and that it can be caused in men by too many fluctuations in size due to \"yo-yo\" dieting, which I have done a lot of the past few years (have mostly been on the AIP diet which has helped my overall health and my weight, but have broken it for periods of time and gorged on junk due to depression from things like deaths in the family).\n\nI'm most concerned about the risk of that separation getting bigger and me getting a hernia as a result.\n\nMost of the info I know, from not lifting heavy to not doing certain exercises, I've had to look up online, and I still have some crucial questions because I saw a nurse practitioner, rather than my PCP, about this issue and to get the order for the ultrasound, but she, in a message relayed by the nurse receptionists, has said I need to wait for the doctor appointment to ask my questions because for some reason they can't.\n\nSo here are some key questions based on current plans for the Fall that could be affected by this diagnosis:\n\n1. What types of excersizes should I avoid at all costs? And what exercises can I do to repair the separation? That is my primary concern in the long term\n\n2. Is it safe to travel by flight with my condition? I have been planning a trip to Japan for almost a year now, which I had set for mid-October, and while I didn't get everything officially booked, I was going to book everything last week before the diagnosis arrived. And I'm too afraid to do anything yet in that regard because I'm afraid either air pressure and altitude would affect me or that if I'm abroad and I'd need medical care it would obviously cost me an arm and a leg.\n\n3. What's roughly the max amount of weight I can lift before it becomes dangerous to my abdominals and risks hernia? \n\nAny insights and answers would be appreciated. I hope I can get a clear direction on what to do to fix my condition or whether I can continue my travel plans before it's too late to decide anything for the fall. My doctor's office's only notes to me were \"keep on exercise and weight loss regimen\" but I've been given no details at all on exactly what to do.\n\nEDIT: forgot to mention that the reason this has become an urgent need for answers is because despite me being refused answers until my appointment with the doctor, the appointment is on September 11th, quite late for any types of planning in regards to recovery or any travel plans."

I had a burrito I tried to eat, got halfway threw and decided I didnt want it. About an hour later, I'm throwing up the half a burrito then just stomach acid.

I\u2019ve done all of this besides the Benadryl and it hasn\u2019t been helping.

But, going back to school and all of that happening, I\u2019m just concerned about how long this \u201cquitting\u201d process will take before I feel happy and healthy. I\u2019ve certainly felt better than I did the first week trying to quit cold turkey, but it\u2019s still been very tough. \nHere are some of my symptoms:\n\n1. Loss of appetite; I\u2019m not hungry by any means like I used to be. I never used to be one to eat a lot, I actually have a small appetite for my size, but for the past month it\u2019s been very tough to eat any substantial amount of food, and I\u2019m rarely ever hungry. I mostly just try to eat when I feel like I\u2019m supposed to. I\u2019m also fairly certain I\u2019ve lost weight, perhaps due to the medication and my loss of appetite. According to my doc I lost 8 lbs in 2 weeks and I look much thinner. \n\n2. Trouble with sleep; since I\u2019ve been on this medication / treatment plan, I struggle to stay up past 9:30pm and struggle to sleep in past 6am. My sleep has gotten better as time has gone on, but the mornings have been very tough for me. I don\u2019t wear the patch at night, #1 because it can cause vivid dreams and #2 because I\u2019m under the impression of, if I didn\u2019t used to consume nicotine while asleep, why should I now? But either way, I wake up in the morning feeling like crap, in fact the mornings are the toughest part for me. Generally, if I can push myself to make it through the morning I know I can make it through the day. \n\n3. Not really sure how to describe it, it feels like there\u2019s a rain cloud over my head at all time. Perhaps that\u2019s what they call depression. I don\u2019t suffer from depression or anxiety normally. I have a medical phobia, I\u2019m scared of everything regarding health problems and the doctor and stuff like that, and I\u2019m sure that isn\u2019t helping my case, causing more stress and anxiety. It\u2019s like I know I\u2019m helping myself each and every day but I still feel very down in the dumps and, especially when I\u2019m alone and with nothing to do, I get very stressed out and upset about my current situation, it\u2019s beyond my control. Generally I\u2019m a pretty relaxed guy, but not lately at all. \n\nSo I just started step 2 of the patch (14mg) and it\u2019ll be about another month, if all goes well, before I can stop with the patch and go on with my life. Two more weeks and then I go to the 7mg and then 2 more weeks and no patch. I\u2019m scared that it will be a tough time for me at the end but at this point I feel like I\u2019ve felt everything that I could possibly feel. Doc recommends I continue with the bupropion for a period after I\u2019m done with the patch to avoid any sort of relapse or trouble, because I\u2019ll eventually have to ween myself off of that as well. \n\nIs everything I\u2019m experiencing normal? Like I said I\u2019m so determined to quit, I\u2019m never letting myself vape again. Poor decision I made and I\u2019m suffering the consequences now I suppose. I just want to know if my current situation is normal and when I should expect to feel happy and healthy again, because it feels like it\u2019s been forever. Just want to feel like myself again! Can\u2019t wait for the day where I feel good and don\u2019t need any of this shit. \nThanks for the help."

I contacted my family physician and went to see her about two weeks ago, but she didn't even examine me. I've been worrying a lot about Peyronie's or dorsal thrombosis. In an attempt to manage the pain and to stimulate some blood flow to the area, I've been massaging the soft tissue on the sides of my shaft as well as the dorsum with some coconut oil. I've done this 5-6 times in the past two weeks. I have really bad health-related OCD, and I've been having some intrusive thoughts today after I did it. Essentially, I'm worried about \"wearing out\" the corpus cavernosum or damaging the tissue by massaging it, and in doing so, shortening the penis or causing some other deformity to the erectile tissue. One of the main reasons I've been massaging it, is because I've noticed slight changes in the tilt/curvature of the shaft, and I'm trying to combat it (if it is Peyronie's) by massaging the tissue to break up any potential plaques of scar tissue at the site of the convex curvature on the right side of the shaft (relative to the medial line)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know it's probably just an irrational fear, but I can't shake it.\n\nIs this something that can happen from massaging/rubbing the tissue with oil? Should I stop doing it?\n\nI'm going to schedule an appointment with a urologist tomorrow, but I'm probably going to have to wait 3-4 weeks before they can fit me in. Is it a bad idea to massage it?"

I smoke both cigarette and weed, but since my flu started i haven't touched a cigarette, but i have smoked weed to help me get through it.  Basically, since yesterday, every time i blow my nose, my mucus is very bloody. However, only from my left nostril (I've had a deviated septum which sort of restricts the breathing from my left nostril, which is probably why it's only that single one that is infected). I imagine it's due to the bad flu on top of living with 2 animals, which i am allergic to... (100 pound husky/lab that sheds like crazy and my girlfriend's cat, who is very fluffy and also loses a lot of hair). This isn't my first time having a sinus/throat infection following a bad flu either...\n\nSo ya, I'm fairly certain my flu is over, but now i have this sinus infection which I'm hoping doesn't pose any long term risks. Should I just ride it out and let it get better on its own? Should i go see a doctor for antibiotics? Are there any over the counter medications that i could take?\n\nThanks"

I order an at home arm cuff bp monitor and check it for the next 2 weeks, the entire time it tests at or below 128/75. I go in for the recheckup and again it test 150/80, the doctor come in, I brought the at home monitor to show them and the bp log, he says he doesn't think I have hypertension, i suggest white coat hypertension, we test my bp and it fluctuates between 150/80 and 120/70 over the course of a few minutes. We test the at home arm cuff against their cuff and stethoscope and the arm cuff shows slightly higher. Mind you the entire thing is very when bam thank you ma'am, very fast pace, doctor probably wants to go home as I'm his last patient and also I think it's just his personality.\n\n After we're done i get a print out of my blood and urine tests and doctors notes, all the tests were within normal ranges, sodium was about 4 points below the max and I've taken measures to reduce my intake but listed in diagnosis is benign hypertension, not white coat hypertension. Looking it up online it says I still have a risk of renal failure, etc. My question is how serious is this, does this qualify as a preexisting condition and do I need to worry about it when it comes to coverage?"

If anyone can work out a way of TL:DRing this I\u2019d be incredibly grateful!\n\nThrowaway as a couple of my friends know my normal username.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n33, Female, 5'8\", 13st 10lb, white, first hypo caught April/May and fainting since the 10th of July.  No smoking or non-prescription drugs, very rarely drink (like a glass or two of wine a month except around Christmas).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMedication: Amitriptyline 75mg/day, levothyroxine 50 microg/day, propranolol 10mg 2-3x/day but until recently 40mg 2x/day, diclofenac gel 1.16% (volterol) 4x/day, occasional cocodamol use (30/500)), naproxen 250mg but am not currently using it due to diclofenac gel. Mirena fitted Tuesday.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIntolerances: cyclazine, tramadol, ondensetron, citric acid.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDiagnoses: tietze's syndrome, non functioning inner ear right hand side, adenomyosis (&amp; possible endometriosis?). Have seen counsellors (including an NHS counsellor) who believe I have CPTSD from childhood/2016 assault but am functioning well enough not to have needed a psych referral.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSurgeries: tonsils 2013, large ovarian cyst right side 2014, top 2 wisdom teeth 2017\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNotable injuries: foot run over by father in estate car when I was 14 (occasional numbness and pain, regularly twist that ankle), fall down the stairs in 2009 with suspected broken coccyx but GP decided it was pointless sending me for an xray, injured wrist in fall down stairs in 2015, 3rd xray 4 months later saw line on scaphoid but different specialists/OTs have differing opinions on whether it may or may not have broken and healed before that xray.\n\n\\----------------------------\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the not immediately relevant background:\n\nI first fainted age 9 or 10, and by my teens was fainting quite regularly. I got very good at knowing when to set my arse on the floor and head between my legs so I\u2019ve not actually lost consciousness more than a handful of times as an adult. Low blood pressure resolved itself sometime around 2013-14 when I was back and forth for tests all of the time which eventually found the large ovarian cyst that was messing my shit up.   \n \n\nI have tietze's syndrome, diagnosed at 18. My inner ear doesn't work on the right hand side, first dizzy spell at 18 for about a month, then every 2 or 3 years I'd have it for a couple of weeks but stematil would normally help. In 2011 I got a dizzy spell that did not go with stematil, betahistine dihydrochloride, or cyclazine (which I had a reaction to), in 2013 it was discovered my inner ear doesn't work on the right hand side. They told me that physio could help my brain adjust but for the rest of my life the dizziness would flare up when stressed or very tired. I was weaned off the betahistine, stematil, naproxen (for my chest) and cocodamol (again, chest) and put on Amitriptyline and started physio for the dizziness. Between then and April this year I'd have to use walking sticks for maybe a week at most every couple of years, and had very infrequent dizzy spells as long as I didn't do anything stupid like run or dance too energetically. Since physio for my chest around the same time I very rarely had to take painkillers for the tietze's syndrome.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAssaulted in 2016 so was put back on naproxen (250mg 3-4x/day) and cocodamol (30/500s but generally get away with one plus a paracetamol as 2 makes me sleepy and unable to focus, I only take 2 when the pain is preventing me from breathing properly), the headaches became awful in 2017 (was diagnosed with migraines by a neurologist while being tested for everything that could possibly be causing the dizziness back in 2012/13), so was upped to 75mg/day Amitriptyline and put on 40mg 2x/day propranolol. I came off the regular cocodamol by the end of 2016 and since have only taken it maybe 3x/month when my chest is making it hard to breathe. I started weaning myself off the naproxen last summer but have had to go up and down a lot on it, only came off it as a day to day thing in June and have taken a dose here and there when struggling since.  \n \n\nStruggled with suicidal ideation winter 2017, thyroid function was low so was put on thyroxine 50microg/day and referred to an NHS counsellor. Saw a staff counsellor after my max 10ish NHS sessions, got my max 6 sessions with the staff counsellor, was referred to a rape and sexual abuse charity and started seeing a counsellor there just before Easter. My first session she told me she believed my father was raping my mother and the stress of being abused is why she died (I did not ask for this opinion, it was volunteered). The second session she asked me to commit to 5 months of counselling so she could invoice the charity, and pressured me by saying she wasn\u2019t sure if I was a suitable candidate for counselling, I told her in this session I wanted to work on my hypervigilance as I think I\u2019m now living somewhere where I can potentially feel safe and it would be a good time to do this. The third and fourth sessions she worked on convincing me that my landlord wants me to move out (I\u2019m a live-in lodger), jumping from reason to reason as I refuted her logic, until she landed on wanting to sell up and move in with his girlfriend when she finally finds a buyer for her house that had been on the market for 18 months. \n\n\\---------------------------------\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*Sugar background\\*: had a high hba1c in 2014, retested 3 weeks later and was normal. A different test around this time showed a low liver function but that was again normal one test later.  Large ovarian cyst was found about a month later so it was taken that it was temporary insulin resistance due to that, cyst was removed December 2014. Had another two high hba1c last year around Easter and summer, adenomyosis was discovered in a scan between the two, was put on metformin taking 500mg 2x/day for 3 months.  Hba1c at Christmas was normal so was reduced to 1/day, then normal again at Easter so taken off completely. First hypo was discovered between the hba1c and getting the results.  \n \n\n\\*Dizziness flare-up\\*: so in March I got eustachian tube dysfunction from a virus. This took a good couple of months to clear-up completely in my right ear. Doctor asked if it might be stress related. As I was made redundant from my main job in January and this was 3 sessions in with the rape and sexual abuse counsellor so I was freaking out about potentially being made homeless I agreed it was a strong possibility. Then in April my landlord\u2019s girlfriend had amazing news that she had sold her house! I woke up the next morning unable to lift my head off the pillow without god-awful motion sickness. After a couple of days it was easing off a bit. This went on for a couple of months where every time she had news surrounding her house hunt or told me she was hoping he\u2019d move in with her I\u2019d wake up the next day with my dizziness symptoms worsened. Have been using walking sticks since April. Around the end of April/beginning of may I had an awful night where after 2 hours of sitting down my wooziness was not improving, so I decided to check my sugars, and I was at around 3.5 mmol/l. After this I started testing myself whenever I wasn\u2019t sure what was causing me to feel dizzy/nauseated and I was between 3.3 to 3.7 mmol/l 3 times a week, and never over 6 mmol/l.   \n\\------------------------------   \n \n\nNow for the main course: \n\n27th of June I saw the osteo who decided to try the injection to see if it would help the wrist pain I\u2019ve been struggling with since 2015. In case anyone\u2019s interested, I\u2019ve seen 2 physios, two OTs, and two osteos since the fall, had 5 or 6 xrays, an MRI, a radiographic isotope scan, and a CT scan. There are cysts in my lunar and scaphoid, the current osteo doesn\u2019t think the scaphoid broke but that a tendon snapped taking a bit of bone with it causing the cyst to grow, as it\u2019s bigger in the xrays from the past two years than it was in the xrays in the first year. He doesn\u2019t think surgery will help. I had a steroid injection in my carpal tunnel in 2016 but it didn\u2019t help. He gave me a local anaesthetic before he did it as I needed to use my sticks to walk to the taxi and into my flat. The pain was god-awful and if anything got worse over the next couple of weeks. Wednesday the 10th of July I was really unwell, started fainting if I stood up for 5-10 minutes, struggled not to start speaking Italian at people (not a language I\u2019ve spoken regularly since about 2009), and my nausea was worse than it usually is for the level of dizziness I had. On the Thursday I went to the GP and she sent me to A&amp;E to be tested for sepsis. They did blood tests and sent me home with an appointment to see the osteo the following Monday. The Saturday I woke up unable to keep water down and struggled not to speak German (not spoken on a regular basis since about 2006). I had a hairdresser\u2019s appointment as I hadn\u2019t been able to wash my own hair since the injection so had been going once a week for a wash and to have it plaited so I didn\u2019t have to even brush it, and I fainted in the hairdresser\u2019s chair. Once home I started feeling cold, was unable to sit up without my vision going black, so I called NHS Direct and spoke with a nurse who asked me to check my blood, which was 4.2 mmol/l. As I was having abdominal pains when I drank water and was alone she decided to call an ambulance which came 1.5 hours later, by which point my sugars were 3.7, blood pressure was low, pulse was high, and my temp was 39\u00b0C. Half an hour later at a&amp;e my blood sugars were 3.2, I was given half a normal dose of glucagon which got me up to 7.1. When they sat my bed up to a 90\u00b0 angle for an xray I fainted. It took them about 2 hours to manage to get a drip in me, during which time a fan got my temp down to 37.8 before it started going up again. Once they got a cannula in I was put on an antibiotic drip. My blood pressure remained low and pulse high throughout (I didn\u2019t take any of the numbers in). About 7 hours after I arrived I was able to sit up, was keeping water down, and ate 3 biscuits, so they sent me home.   \n \n\nThe pain in my wrist was loads better for a couple of days but then slowly began worsening again. The whole time though I\u2019ve not been able to stand for more than maybe 30 minutes on my best day before my vision starts going black, on my worst day after about 2 or 3 hours of sitting my vision starts going black. During my appointment with the osteo on the Monday I started fainting while he was examining my wrist and some poor medical student ended up holding my feet up while I lay down. Two weeks later my GP starts weaning me off the propranolol because of the low blood pressure, and says there were some signs of infection in my blood tests on both visits, she said a low white blood cell count but also mumbled something I didn\u2019t catch, so I had tests again 3 weeks ago but there were no signs of infection, however my hba1c was a bit low. I didn\u2019t go below 4.2 for 3 weeks after leaving the hospital, since then I\u2019ve set a new low score once a week, getting to 2.7 mmol/l last Friday. I was given diclofenac gel for my wrist 2.5 weeks ago, and last week managed to wash my hair myself while wearing a splint (I am perhaps irrationally happy about being able to take care of my hair again!) I\u2019m still having days where I can\u2019t leave the flat though as I can\u2019t stand up long enough to even put on make-up, brush my teeth, or make breakfast beyond grabbing a cereal bar.   \n \n\nDiet wise: Last night decided I got off the bus two stops early to get chips (fries but like big and chunky ones) then walk the extra two stops home (almost passed out a couple of times). After a bag of chips, a cheese &amp; onion fry-it (like cheesy potato mash in breadcrumbs and fried), and a large bread roll, my sugar levels were 12.5 mmol/l. A few weeks ago a friend bought a box of Krispy Kreme and I had one on the Sunday, which put my sugar levels at 4.6, and one on the Monday which put my sugar levels at 8.5, the only other time I\u2019ve gone over 7 since leaving the hospital. Generally no matter what I eat, whether a salad or a veggie burger, my sugars are between 4.2 and 6 mmol/l. I can\u2019t spot a pattern; if the hypos were always after a day I\u2019ve indulged and eaten more carbs than usual I\u2019d assume it was a reactive hypo, or if it were always on days where I\u2019d been really goodwith very little carbs I\u2019d think I wasn\u2019t having enough, but there\u2019s no rhyme nor reason. I\u2019ve been trying to keep my carbs to 100-200 cals per meal, not going over 600 cal of carbs a day, and keeping my treats to 100-200 cals a day with fun size chocolate or biscuit (cookie) packs. However since the steroid injection I\u2019ve not been able to hold a knife, so I\u2019ve been relying on ready meals. I have generally kept my meals to 500 cal max by only eating half of the ready meal and topping it up with a bag of pre-washed salad or a bag of frozen veg, so the chips blow-out was a one-off treat. Maybe once a fortnight I\u2019ve had a veggie Burger King kids meal or a pizza, both a 700cal treat, but my sugars haven\u2019t topped 6.5 mmol/l on those days. I try to keep my overall daily cals to 1500 per day but occasionally hit around 2000. Despite this my weight has been fluctuating between 13st 7lb and 14st 2lb for months. I lost 5lb the week following the injection, but put 2lb back on the following week, but that\u2019s been a general pattern. I started weighing myself again last summer and I\u2019ll lose maybe 7lb the fortnight of my period (10m days), then put it back on the next fortnight no matter how well I eat. Last year I got back into swimming and was doing 20-30mins 3x/week, plus walking around work and town. When I got the ear infection I think I missed a week but then got back to 2-3 times a week with ear plugs and going at times children weren\u2019t allowed. When the dizziness flared up I started going for hour long walks 2-3 times a week as part of my physio (only managing about 2km in that hour). Since the steroid injection I\u2019ve not managed to swim. I\u2019ve tried going for walks on good days but have to sit down maybe every 300 yards, whether that\u2019s a low wall or the floor, like 0.7km total on my best day. Before getting the Tietze\u2019s syndrome at 18 I used to run, usually an hour, about 3x/week. After a year or so of struggling to get into a new normal I started dancing, and won a national competition a year before the dizziness became a long-term issue. I then started octopush (underwater hockey), but then the pain from the ovarian cyst made me unable to bend and twist properly and there were concerns about me taking a kick to the stomach from one of the bigger guys (mixed sex sport), so between 2016 and 2018 my attendance at the pool for swimming or aqua aerobics was sporadic. I am getting really frustrated at getting into a routine then having something knock me back.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI need to stop my vision going black and going light-headed when I stand up so that I can get back to work, the pool, and going for walks to help with my energy, mood, getting some sort of social life back. I need my dizziness and wrist pain gone so I can get back to normal at work and get off my crutches so I can hatch more eggs in pokemon go. I\u2019d like to know what I need to do diet or exercise wise to stop having either high or low blood sugars. The 600 cal max carbs/day and 3 swims a week was working great until these hypos started. Unfortunately occasionally when I get these hypos I end up bingeing, hence the 700 cal sittings once a fortnight (usually I\u2019d eat a pizza that size in three sittings on different days with the leftovers boxed in the fridge)."

        "reddit": "Hi, female, 24 years old, 5\u20197, 115 pounds? (51 kg)\n\nFor the last 2 months my weigh went from around 52,5 kg (115 pounds) to 105 pounds (47.8 kg). I was having some anxiety and that probably contributed to the weight loss but as soon as I realized that, I started eating more, I started having breakfast, eating in the middle of the morning and middle of afternoon, 3 new meals that I usually don\u2019t have. Instead of gaining the weight, I lost it. Right now I\u2019m less stressed out but still not gaining weight. For example this week I was gradually gaining weight and got to 112 pounds until yesterday. Today it went to 107 pounds. No bowel movement during these measurements and no exercise. Now I\u2019ll have another week of this and suddenly for an unknown reason, I lose it all again. All I know is that I\u2019ve been eating more than before. Before I was able to keep my weight and now I\u2019m losing and eating more. Bowel movements used to be once every 3 days. They\u2019re pretty much the same. Sometimes it changes to once every day for a couple of days. Consistency and color look normal. I\u2019ve been to a lot of doctors already all they found was iron and folic acid deficiency. They keep telling me it\u2019s anxiety but I\u2019ve been anxious for years and it never changed my weight. I had blood tests for hormones and sugar to rule out hyperthyroidism and diabetes and tbh I don\u2019t know what else to do. With all this diet changes all I could get was gaining 0.8kg (1 pound). I\u2019ve read online it can be a tumor using the calories and I\u2019m freaking out. I\u2019m an anxious person so doctors look at me and immediately think that it\u2019s all anxiety. Should I rush to the hospital? I\u2019m freaking out"

I am certainly hungover today but mostly that\u2019s dehydration and fatigue. \n\nWhen I woke up this morning, my back pain was much worse, and is now also radiating as an ache in my chest. My chest feels constricted and tight, as if someone were squeezing me. I can breathe well enough, but it feels like I don\u2019t get quite enough air unless I breathe very deeply. Expanding my lungs relieves some pressure in my back but does not increase any pain. I have no pain in my neck, jaw, or limbs.\n\nI lost my insurance, have no savings, and my credit is currently maxed out, so seeing a regular doctor isn\u2019t an option for me. When I google my symptoms I mostly see \u201cheart attack\u201d, but I don\u2019t feel like that\u2019s right so I\u2019m not going to the ER. Am I being foolish? Is this something I should rush in for, or can I just lay on an icepack?"

        "reddit": "I've always snored, but until recently, it only ever affected the sleep of those around me. In fact, on a few occasions,  while still half awake, I was told I was snoring - but I couldn't hear anything!\n\nAbout three weeks ago, as I was trying unsuccessfully to fall asleep, I heard myself snore. It happened once or twice after that, and elevating my head and changing sleeping positions helped. \n\nBut about five days ago, I very loudly snorted myself awake. Two or three times. Since then, every night, I've heard myself snore at least once. Usually, it happens after I wake up in the middle of the night. My anxiety prevents me from going back to sleep and I end up hearing myself snore in a half-awake state, which just makes it harder to fall back asleep. Last night, I slept for 7 hours uninterrupted, but snorted myself awake twice after I tried to sleep in.\n\nI should note - I'm a male. 5'11 and 300 pounds. I am also a very heavy drinker. I imagine if I stopped doing drinking as much at night, I would have the same problems I do when I wake up in the middle of the night (anxiety, half sleep, hearing my own snores).\n\nI have not been tested for sleep apnea, but after discussing it with my doctor at my last physical, I didn't present any of the symptoms. I don't wake up with a sore throat. I don't feel restless or exhausted in the morning (at least I didn't before these problems started). I don't get morning headaches. I don't feel fatigued or fall asleep during the day. Snoring runs in my family, but sleep apnea does not. \n\nI just want one night where I don't hear my own snores. I'm currently elevating my head, sleeping on my side, and using nasal strips, but nothing seems to work. I also take daily allergy medications and use nasal decongestion spray.

        "reddit": "I am 19 years old, south Asian, I weigh 191 pounds, I\u2019m male and the issue has been going on for 4 days now. I started taking bactrim on 8/21 and soon after noticed my throat was sore I had a cough and I was having a runny nose as well as discomfort in my left eye. I also started waking up at 2 am every night and lost my appetite and began having pain in my feet. \n\nI contacted my doctor on 8/23 after I vomited one hour following my first dose of bactrim. He said to stop taking it and said that my eye discomfort, sore throat and runny nose was due to a unrelated viral upper respiratory infection and said to wait until my viral symptoms went away. He said the other symptoms were most likely a physical manifestation of anxiety and that I should not be concerned. Furthermore he said that if my prostate symptoms  (I was given bactrim for possible prostatitis) go away then I should all together discontinue bactrim.\n\nI stopped taking it that day (8/23) and at this point (8/25) my sore throat, runny nose and cough are mostly gone. However I\u2019ve noticed I still have some slight burning and pain in my eyes  (almost entirely in my left eye) and I have a slight headache. My foot pain and sleeping problems are also resolved (although I did have a lot of trouble sleeping due to severe anxiety about these issues at night on 8/23). Today (8/25)  I found that I have a spot on my right arm that has turned yellowish/purplish \u2014 like a bruise but I don\u2019t remember hitting my arm. The spot doesn\u2019t hurt or burn or anything, and it hurts very slightly when I touch it. I also have been having random itchiness on different areas of my body randomly through out the day. \n\nShould I be concerned or are these unrelated to the bactrim and are just viral cold symptoms/anxiety symptoms? And what should I do next?"

I do not feel tired, but I will physically sleep for 15 hours without waking, sometimes I'll sleep through a whole weekend(Like i just did) With short periods to eat. I have noticed that at points I have purpelish discoloration on the inside of my eyes on both side, specifically the area on the bridge of my nose. This discoloration peaks right after I wake. I had a feeling it might be vitamins or something, but I've been drinking omega and vits for about a month with no relief. Does anyone know what could cause this?\n\nThanks for any help. I'm looking at getting to a Doc as soon as I have some cash."

        "reddit": "Hello! 29M, 5\u201911, 170 LBS, non-cigarette smoker/non-vaper, recently abstaining cannabis user here! \n\nI recently began taking the supplement St. John\u2019s Wort. (900mg a day for 7 days) to help me with some of my mild depression. I had realized that the supplement wasn\u2019t really helping me and I decided to stop taking it. Fast forward a couple weeks later and I\u2019m feeling somewhat blue, so I take a St. John\u2019s Wort, try it again and about two hours later I\u2019m in absolute terror.\n\nI suppose I would consider this my first panic attack. Shallow and quick breathing, fear of death, \u2018dark\u2019 thoughts, cold sweats elevated heart rate- text book panic attack. This happened on the NYC subway for the first one. The second one happened at breakfast with friends while on vacation. Immediately lost my appetite, felt out of control and had to excuse myself. I didn\u2019t really regain my appetite for another 30 hours. \n\nI also recently have been somewhat terrified of all the news reports about vaping and collapsing lungs, so this weighed heavily on my mind throughout my panics. (For the record, I was smoking a single 3% Mango Juul Pod a day. I was also using THC carts purchased on the black market. I have since stopped using both and never intend using ether again.)\n\nI didn\u2019t make the connection that it could be St. John\u2019s wort, so I took it again the second day and, again, another panic attack. \n\nI did a lot of research and was able to find a handful of anecdotal stories from people with similar stories and experiences. Mostly around the supplement triggering panic attacks. Something about how it may function similar to an SSRI causing problems in people with already working serotonin levels. \n\nTo be honest, it\u2019s really weird for me to have a panic attack. While I will suffer from depression and maybe even a little rage from time to time. Panic attacks are not really in my medical history. They are, however, in my family history. My mother has quite intense claustrophobia when flying, and takes Xanax to manage her anxiety.  \n\nDisclosures: i drink occasionally, I recently quit vaping (5 weeks strong), I do smoke marijuana joints [.25 grams per day] as I mentioned previously, I recently quit using concentrates. I use no other drugs or am I on any prescriptions. I exercise regularly. I Keep hydrated and keep a strictly vegetarian diet.\n\nCurious what everyone thinks here. What\u2019s going on! Is this supplement really this dangerous or is there something else going on I should pay attention to? I\u2019ve made an appointment with a doctor for a couple weeks down the line, hopefully I can get guidance then. I was hoping this sub could advise me on the next steps."

As the title states I have just quit smoking cold turkey and I\u2019m just under a week clean.

Sometimes I\u2019ll get random stabbing pains throughout my upper body as well which is very frightening when your anxiety is naturally already high. The chest pressure has subsided some, but I feel like when I breathe my lungs have a slight irritation (some pain) as well as my throat being irritated and dry which will sometimes cause my neck to get tight (only on right side). I was wondering if these are normal symptoms and if I should see a doctor. I\u2019m currently using vapor rub, cough drops, saline spray, and a decongestant to help some.

I returned home from a spring break trip with friends and realized my penis felt a little weird. I narrowed down the symptoms (mainly random discharges throughout the day but also a little twitching) to assume I had chlamydia. I went to Planned Parenthood and they confirmed this, but gave me a pill to take so it would go away in a few days. I thought I would be fine after that.\n\nHowever, since then, I have noticed that my penis will randomly vibrate or have weird muscle spasms throughout the day. Some days are worse than others, but it's been pretty consistent since the chlamydia. I have not had sex with anyone since this whole ordeal, so I don't believe it's a new STD I would've picked up.\n\nLately, I have also had days where I feel a similar vibration or spasm in my eyelids. Seems to be pretty random. No pain whatsoever but it's a very weird feeling, and the fact that it's gone on this long has me a bit concerned.\n\nI masturbate regularly and I've taken Finasteride daily since April. In addition, I regularly smoke Juul which I have been cutting back on lately to quit soon. I don't know if any of these things contribute to this issue but I haven't ruled them out. Any ideas? Or would it be best to finally visit the doctor?"

It was treated as allergies for a long time, but recently I got to see an ENT because it didn't get better. My main symptom is that I feel like my ears constantly need to pop. Even if I pop them, I feel pressure and can \"make\" a clicking noise, especially by popping my jaw. I also am constantly sniffing, having post nasal drainage, and have almost no sense of smell. Sometimes my nose gets dry and I've had nose bleeds.\n\nMy ENT insisted it was just my prozac causing issues based on the dryness.

I just got the results online and it's a LOT to take in. I don't hardly understand a single word of it.

He doesn\u2019t drink or smoke.  \n\nA couple hours ago we were watching TV when he started having some weird vision issues, which resulted in a headache. He lay down to close his eyes, and after about ten minutes noticed that his left arm felt numb and tingly, but didn\u2019t think he had slept on it or had it in a weird position. His headache felt more like a tension headache than intense pain, and he seemed a little disoriented or slow to form thoughts. He described the vision issues as a sort of fog, where he could see things but was having trouble processing what he was seeing. I don\u2019t think he was seeing flashes of light or anything like that, and it sounded to me like the difficulty was with understanding visual information, rather than simply not being able to see things. It\u2019s been about two hours since this started, and while it seems to have lessened he still feels very \u201coff,\u201d with a headache, slight nausea and sensitivity to stimuli, and mental fog.\n\nHe doesn\u2019t have a history of migraines but thinks his mom might get them from time to time. I think he\u2019s unsure if that\u2019s the issue since migraines always seem to involve excruciating pain, and while his headache is bad it doesn\u2019t seem earth-shatteringly severe.

        "reddit": "34 - Male - 6'0\" - 235 lbs - Hispanic - Paraplegic (from the chest down) - Over 2 months\n\nHi, I kind of feel like a hypochondriac with this. I'll try to make it short and detail the most current state of things. About 3 months ago I saw my doctor because I was feeling constipated. I've never been regular, and going 4 or 5 days without a bowel movement isn't uncommon. I was getting to the point though where it was going over 5 days and I just felt it wasn't healthy for obvious reasons. The doctor did an x-ray to show me the backed-up feces. He suggested I try some Miralax and see how it goes. That really did nothing for me. The next step was suppositories. Those worked and got me going, but I still felt like they weren't fully doing the job. Over the last 2.5/3 months I've had maybe one week where I had average bowel movements every 2 days. The rest of the time it's been 4 or 5 days. And some of those times I just got concerned that it had been too long and I end up using suppositories. I've probably used about a dozen suppositories in the last 3 months to get a bowel movement going. This continues to be the situation. A more recent development that has me concerned is a change in the smell of my flatulence. Not to be gross, but I'm sure most of us know the normal smell of our own gas. Or at least I do. Over the last 4-6 weeks mine has not smelled normal. It has a smell of what I can best describe as rotten dairy. It's not overly strong, but I can definitely notice the difference. Also, after it's been about 3 or 4 days since I bowel movement, I have excessive gas. \n\nI'm a paraplegic and have never been regular since being paralyzed 20 years ago, but this is a little excessive. Based on what I've said, do any immediate concerns come to mind?  I went to the doctor today because of a UTI. I tried to see my regular doctor but he was out for the day. I saw a different physician. I mentioned to her the ongoing constipation and the change in odor. She immediately asked me if there was blood in my stool or if I was having thin, pencil-like bowel movements. I am not. I know those are indicators of colon cancer, which is something I'm concerned about, but I'm not having those particular symptoms. She said to bring it up to my regular doctor since he knows more about my history, and she also suggested trying probiotics for a few weeks to alter my gut flora and see if that makes any difference.\n\nIf you've made it this far, a little more history.  2 things: About 3 years ago I had a 4 month period where I was constantly passing mucus. On most days, multiple times a day I would have the sensation that I need to either have a bowel movement or pass gas, and when I'd try to go I would just pass mucus. Globs of mucus that were mostly colorless and resembled raw chicken in the toilet, or almost had a jelly-like consistency when not in water. After a few months of this my doctor ordered a colonoscopy. Everything with that came back normal and looked fine. The next step was to see a specialist. I have a terrible habit of loosing all symptoms right when I'm about to see someone about them. The day before seeing the specialist all the symptoms stopped and I no longer passed mucus. I met with the specialist who was going to have me provide samples, but nothing ever came from it because I was no longer passing it. He said without being able to get samples, there wasn't much else they could do. So after 4 months of constantly experiencing this it went nowhere and the doctors could provide no answers.\n\nThe second thing, possibly related, possibly not is that after a decent sized meal, or a regular meal if I haven't had a bowel movement in a few days, I get an achy feeling on my left side just below my ribs. One doctor I saw thought it could be a kidney stone. They did some imaging tests and found nothing aside from the fact that I don't have a functioning kidney on my left side, so it wasn't a stone. I found out years ago that I only have one kidney, but I couldn't remember which one I had, my right or left, and for some reason my chart did not specify. The scan did reveal that I actually do have both kidneys, but the left one is small and non-functioning. From there the doctors didn't have much for answers. They said maybe my stomach is just sensitive to certain foods and pretty much left it at that. \n\nKnowing all this, what would your next coarse of action be, if anything? Like I said, I feel like a hypochondriac sometimes because the plumbing doesn't ever seem to be working correctly, but we never get any answers as to why that is. It's kind of a vicious cycle because I keep having symptoms, don't get answers, which causes anxiety and makes me feel like there is something that we're missing and I'm afraid it might be something major. So in a way I am a bit of a hypochondriac regarding this.  I'm paralyzed from the chest down and while I do have some feeling, it is also dulled compared to what a normal person feels.  So maybe there's something I'm not feeling, or maybe what I am feeling is being misinterpreted by myself since I can't fully feel the sensation. If you have any thoughts, please throw them my way.  I'm just sick of never feeling quite right and not getting any answers.\n\nThank you for reading all this and any input you may have."

It was very tender, felt like I could feel my entire colon. There was also pain there as well. I also experiences a gnawing like burning pain in the colon or stomach area and I thought it was an ulcer. Anyway, my doctor says it's all IBS due to my family history of IBS. Blood work all came out clean and perfectly normal, healthy 19 year old blood. My stool would range from normal with some black dots and blackness (It wasn't enough to warrant a bleeding scare) down to the softest stool ever. Anyway, three doctor's thought that it was IBS and that it wasn't an ulcer and e eventually everything went away on its own.\n\nIs this actually IBS? Now my symptoms pop randomly. One week I'm perfectly normal pooping and everything, the next I'm having infrequent stool, stool that is literally half smooth and half clumped balls in the same specimen, spasming a lot in the colon and pressure (probably a lot of gas) and just small pains there. Pressing down on it, I can feel things move around, so I'm guessing gas and stool. Anyway, everything feels crazy down there and I'm a perfectly healthy 19 year old that even works out, etc. She believes it could be related to heart anxiety that I had and stress (my holter monitor cleared it as no issues) so I'm really not sure if maybe I just have gas issues.\n\nI think dairy could be the culprit too, can you become lactose intolerant all of a sudden?\n\nWhat's your thoughts? Many doctors cleared me as IBS by blood, stool, psychical examination, etc. I messaged my doctor my concerns but I really can't afford to go get more testing done as I'm a college student. Am I freaking out over nothing? Could someone provide me with relief that I'm okay? Should I be having colon cancer scares? I haven't had a colonoscopy yet and I'm not sure my doctor suggests it yet. It gets so weird because I can feel my heart beat there too sometimes in the colon. Pressure? I drink water all the time, rarely drink sodas. I'm really not sure if I'm just feeling normal everyday experiences or this is just IBS.\n\nI usually wake up every day feeling like I need to go (stomach pains) but like it goes away a bit after waking. It's odd. \n\nAge:19\nSex:Male\nHeight: ~~5'12\"~~ 6'0\"\nWeight: 144lbs\nRace: White\nLocation: Left abdomen\nDuration: off and on several months."

She's saturating 85%. We take her to the hospital again and take newer exams. The medic concludes that the pneumonia was totally healed, with no signs of infecction nor inflamation in the blood count. He then concludes that this sleepyness can be caused by excess medication in her blood, probably the Quetiapine, because her body was dealing with an infection so her  capacity to  excrete  the meds was  diminished. The medic prescribes 3 days without Quetiapine and on the 4th day, cut quetiapine dose in half and look for her  psychiatrist  to determine the dose.\n\n08/03 She's still in the same way.

As a teen it was pretty severe. I had 1 round of accutane about 13 years ago. The accutane had extreme side effects but my skin started to get better on day 1 of being on it. My skin was good for a few years after stopping Accutane and then the acne came back. I have thought that my acne gets alot worse when i am under stress (daily) and gets better when i am on holidays, weird i know. I also stopped all dairy for 3 months to see if helped and i think it did however it was the same time i started my antibiotics. I just started to eat cheese again  and now i am breaking out this week.\n\nOver the last few years i have had extremely oily yet dry skin. This week is really bad. I am a picker, if i see a whitehead i will pop it as i feel it heals quicker once popped and a cream or blister bandaid put on. I understand that picking can be bad but its either whiteheads or red skin at this point.\n\nI have been to many doctors and 1 dermatologist. I have been given every cream/ointment in the book. I am currently on a antibiotic for this from the recommendation from my doc and derm together as they did not want to give me Accutane yet which i can understand why, its not severe in a medical sense right now.\n\nI feel like i have tried everything to clean my skin but the oil production is the problem here. I went from having a regime i followed daily to switching to nothing but water to wash my face now to try and simplify things. It seems like doing less was better for my skin (caveman idea). My skin can be OK for a week or 2 then a breakout happens with no change of lifestyle.\n\nThis acne is really destroying my life. The loss of self esteem when you look into the mirror is really hard. The amount of oil that comes off when you wipe it with a napkin is alarming. Low self esteem, anxiety, depression, are all bigger things that come along with just a little acne. Many plans have been cut short because of this. The last time i spoke to my doc about the other issues that come with acne, he suggested a psychologist which is all good but i still have acne.\n\nIs there anything you fine people can suggest? Any tests i can ask my doctor for? Any diet changes that may help? Any medication/vitamins that may help? I really want to go on Accutane just to get this solved but Accutane is for severe acne, not oily skin. The side effects from Accutane can be brutal also but i think 1 year of dry skin and nosebleeds beats a lifetime of this. I am worried also that if i take Accutane the problem will come back like it did many years ago.\n\nThank you all for your time!"

The first day was fine, the second day is when the anxiety started, third day it was worse, 4th day it started to get better and by today i\u2019m feeling more like myself, still a little anxious, but I haven\u2019t had any panic attacks or anything like that. I checked my blood pressure 3 times and twice i was a little high (i\u2019m almost always a little high, something like 130/80, docs never seemed concerned by it) and once it came back a little low for me but also nothing crazy (something like 120/70 which i guess is normal but it\u2019s never been like that doe me.)  i can\u2019t really tell you if my heartrate was elevated because the first time i checked it was after just leaving the gym so obviously it would be slightly up , and every time after that it was mid anxiety attack so like.... yeah it was elevated close to 130pbm.  Is that a normal side effect? Or could it have been something else? I also take kratom fairly frequently (have been on and off for years) and i drink 3 or 4 cups of espresso a day, but neither of those things have ever had this effect on me until I introduced tadalafil into the equation, which makes me think that\u2019s the culprit. Any ideas on what\u2019s going on? Do i just have permanent random anxiety attacks forever now? I\u2019ve since cut out kratom entirely and have only been drinking one cup of coffee in the morning. I would have expected to be at 100% right now being that tadalafil\u2019s halflife is something like 17.5 hours, i figured i\u2019d just ride out the storm but it sucks pretty bad.\nEdit: just checked my heart rate right now, it\u2019s kicking at about 75bpm, which is average for me."

        "reddit": "Hi all, I done something to my back earlier around the start of this year which has gradually resulted in incredible difficulty with walking and being completely unable to sleep on my back straight or sides without being in absolute agony and needing someone to pull me up straight (I should also mention that the longer I lay flat on my back, the harder and more painful it is get back up).\n\nOn Wednesday I was having a ct scan and naively thought it would be mostly pain free, uncomfortable at most, especially after seeing others walk in and out of the scanning room without pain. I also forgot that I hadn't lay flat on my back for a while and when expected to was told that there would be plenty of staff to help get me up and back onto the ward bed. The ct scan lasted approx 5 - 8mins with anxiety of how I was going to get back up. Once the scan had finished, the pain of them pulling me up had resulted in me screaming and cringe instantly in what felt like something being ripped out of my lower back which also felt like one of the worse pains I've endured or at least the worse back pain I've ever experienced. Once on the ward bed and waiting for someone to take me back to the ward, I could feel odd/out-of-sync deep heart palpations which lasted for at least 10mins.\n\nLater on that day I was unexpectedly told to go for an mri and also told that it could last for up to 30mins, with 10ml of oral morphine for pain relief (I'm currently being prescribed 60mg of codeine 4x per day) and had unfortunately cancel it due to the pain and not finding much pain relief from 10ml of morphine after realising that there was still a lot of strong pain slowing my ability to walk and still resulting in having to grip onto things to help with walking a bit straighter.\n\nThe next morning, doctors on the ward had informed me that they had spotted fractures at my lower spine and some shape/tissue abnormalities. They also wanted to still have an mri scan of my spine and had told me that they would be testing pain relief whilst laying me flat on my back on the ward bed to find the right dose which would allow for the scan to be endured. Unfortunately no tests were made yesterday and today they suggested the same and someone suggested using midazolam to help sedate whilst another doctor suggested a low dose of lorazepam for anxiety. They also told me that the mri won't be ready till next week and that it can sometimes last for 40+ mins.\n\nI'm generally unsure of what to do or ask of the doctors next week, and feel quite terrified of whether the pain could be insanely worse than the ct scan... :/\n\nI should also mention that I'm approx 5'9 in height and currently weigh around 20st in weight which is mostly from fluid build up of water.  I'm currently prescribed thiamine, spironolactone, omaprozol, vitamin C supplements and codeine with paracetamol.  I'm also 28 and female (transgender).  I've not had any significant previous medical problems and currently being treated for an infection, swelling and back problems.  Oh, I also don't smoke but was a heavy drinker until approx 3 weeks ago.  I also reside in the UK."

The pain is only on the left side, I'll attach a photo so I can give you a better idea (circled in blue) but when you put your tongue behind your last molar on the side, and you can feel a part of you jaw (I think that's your jaw?) through the soft palette, that's what hurts !! It hurts really bad to touch and it feels as if somehow it got pushed back or to the side? Like I feel like I can feel more of it than typical through my soft palette. This all started on Saturday night I think last weekend, I heard a cracking noise like my jaw cracked, went to sleep, and woke up in a lot of pain... at first I thought it was a sore throat, but later figured out it was my jaw I think. It was bothering me all week and I know it was a bad idea, but I kept touching the area with my tongue too to check for any changes because it gave me anxiety, yesterday I poked the area with my tongue and felt a pop and now it feels like it's pushed back, like out of place because I can feel more of the bone than I could before? And very painful... I see my family doctor on Tuesday, but I'm not sure if I should wait any longer with this pain? Does it sound like something I should go to the emergency room for, or should I wait it out?\n\n[https://imgur.com/qw1lRnX](https://imgur.com/qw1lRnX)"

In June, I went on vacation and on one of the days had an extremely enormous meal for lunch.. it was probably the biggest portion of food I have ever eaten in the span of one hour. My abdomen/stomach felt extremely distended and even breathing became a little more difficult (not by much but that says how much I ate). Following this meal, I began feeling symptoms of acid reflux and my voice became a bit hoarse - a telltale sign of reflux for me, as I had experienced acid reflux for about a month because of my late eating habits a year ago (that was treated successfully with 300mg Zantac at bedtime and raising the head of my bed). Fast forward now to today (\\~2.5 months later) and I completed a 2.5 month course of Prilosec 20mg 2x/day 30-60 min before meals, Zantac 150mg 2-3x/day, Tums, and Gaviscon more recently, yet I still feel significant reflux. I will say that since taking lifestyle measures more seriously for the last month, my symptoms are not AS bad (smaller portions spread out throughout the day, lower fat meals, still raising head of bed, not eating late, etc), although they are still very bothersome to me and impact my quality of life, as I have to avoid many foods and avoid things I used to enjoy, and it also impacts my weightlifting significantly. **My acid reflux also causes vocal cord scarring and throat irritation often**, which is a shame because I enjoy singing.\n\nOne more thing to note; I am currently on my 6th month of Myorisan (isotretinoin) 40mg 2x/day and I believe it may be drying out my vocal cords and making singing difficult. I am also aware that isotretinoin dries out your organs and may adversely affect the GI tract. **Could it be possible that isotretinoin is exacerbating my GERD and delaying the healing process?** Last year when I had acid reflux, it was resolved relatively quickly and I was not on isotretinoin.\n\nI attached GIFs of my fluoroscopic esophagoscopy/barium swallow study. I have yet to hear about my final results but the **radiologist had mentioned that I** ***looked*** **anatomically normal and that all he noticed was a slight delay in the time it took for the barium to empty from the esophagus into the stomach** (visualized in one of the GIFs).\n\n**Is it possible that my one instance of extreme overeating on vacation may have stretched out the layer of smooth muscle around my stomach too much to the point of affecting the Angle of His and therefore weakening one of the mechanisms in which the GEJ is sealed off to prevent reflux? And if so, how likely is it that these muscles may recover and that my Angle of His may be returned to normal?** I could be totally off about all this, I'm just guessing. Please let me know if you think it's something else... the fluoroscopies I looked at showed a silhouette of a stomach wall that didn't show much of an obtuse Angle of His by any means, but maybe I am wrong. Perhaps it is an issue with the LES itself, or maybe neither... I'm not sure. I've only had a barium swallow study done so far.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you for your time."

I am healthy even with the disorder, but my quality of life will increase with surgery. Will these surgeries potentially disqualify me as a good match for my mother? I do not have a disease and my overall health is not affected at all. \n\n*Would it be safe for me to donate a kidney to my mother this year (as soon as possible if I'm a match) and still have surgery in Nov and Jan? \n\n*Is it true that my mother could die at any time? Does she need emergency dialasis? \n\n*What are the criteria for being a good donation match for a person with my mother's blood type? I'm thinking that if myself and two of my siblings all have A negative blood as well, and are healthy and willing/able, there shouldn't be a reason that each of us are a match. Am I wrong? \n\n*Would donating a kidney make having future children unsafe for my sister?\n\n*Is there anything else that I should consider but haven't asked?"

        "reddit": "Sex: female\nAge: 24\n\nHello Everyone,\n\nBackground: if I do not pee after sex I almost always get a UTI. This has been going on since I started being sexually active a few years ago. So I have been very careful to always pee. Occasionally however I will forget(about once a year). \n\nTwo weeks ago I got a UTI, was put on antibiotics for it for 5 days (Nitrofurantoin). Nothing severe - blood in urine, a little smelly, needing to pee but only a little coming out and a burning sensation when peeing. After three days the symptoms cleared up. I finished the full 5 days. \n\nThree days after that however, the symptoms came back. I woke up with burning when peeing,  blood and flakes in pee. I wouldn\u2019t be able to see a doctor for a few days so I decided to wait it out. Starting that day I drank a ton of water and went to the bathroom as much as possible and as the day progressed my symptoms would slowly get better. Then I would wake up and would get the same symptoms and would do it again - drink a ton of water and symptoms would faze out. This lasted three days. On the forth day (today) I woke up and it seemed as though my symptoms were no longer there - the only thing I kind of felt was a slight full feeling in the bladder. This was also the day I went to see my doctor. I explained my symptoms and he prescribed the same antibiotics but for 7 days instead of 5. \n\nHere is my question: I have read a ton online that said UTIs can sometimes clear on their own . Could it be possible that this happened? My symptoms defiantly came back after that 5 day antibiotics treatment but I\u2019m thinking me drinking all that water when it happened may have just diluted the pee making me not feel any discomfort? I\u2019m scared that taking another round of antibiotics will cause more harm than good. But then again even if it\u2019s just a small bit of bacteria left it would be better to kill it off?\nI\u2019m staying away from sexual intercourse for at least a month to be extra safe.\n\nTl;dr:\nhad a UTI \u2014&gt; it cleared up after 5 days of antibiotics\u2014&gt; it came back after 3 days \u2014&gt; I drank a ton of water and seemed to have flushed it out in 3 days w/o antibiotics\u2014&gt; Saw a doctor again now I\u2019m on 7 days of antibiotics \nScared this will cause more hard then good ie Bacteria will become more resistant in the future"

I am a nurse and work inpatient so I am on my feet for 12 hour shifts. I have great shoes; try to take care of my feet but thought maybe I just had a rough few shifts. It happened in one isolated incident at work and then got better so I forgot about it. \n\nThen at the beginning of this week, the pain came back and didn\u2019t go away. It is mainly in my lower back (starts at about L4 or L5) and then radiates down into my hips and legs, knees and feet. Occasionally I\u2019ll get a shooting pain in my arms but mainly in my lower half of my body. It feels like shin splints, a throbbing persistent pain but definitely in my bones and not in muscles. No OTC pain meds have relieved it. Nothing makes it go away but it does go away sometimes. Activity makes it better but once I am at rest it is way worse. \n\nI went to the doctor the other day because I missed work all week and since my PCP had no availability until 8/30 I went to the same clinic\u2019s walk in clinic. He had no clue; said it might be fibromyalgia. I asked if it could be low vitamin D because I read with PCOS that it\u2019s common to have low Vit D levels. Results came back at 28. \n\nI thought I was feeling better today but now that I\u2019m done running errands and home resting it\u2019s happening again.  \n\nI have not been taking the best care of my self recently. I rotate between day and night shift and have been on nights for the last 3 weeks and my self care is depleted when I\u2019m on nights. I bought a Vit D3 supplement just to see if it helps. I also had some tingling in my hands and feet so I thought low Vit D was more likely. I also kind of stopped my citalopram cold turkey (not on purpose but my schedule got messed up from night shift) and was wondering if it\u2019s a weird withdrawal side effect? I also have had large cysts on my ovaries that have caused back pain in the past and I do have some ovary pain right now so I thought maybe there\u2019s a relation but don\u2019t think so if it\u2019s bone related. The MD I saw didn\u2019t even mention anything remotely worrisome but I can\u2019t stop thinking that it could be bone cancer or something. \n\nAny thoughts on what could be going on? I\u2019m miserable and just want to feel better plus I\u2019m worried about the possibility of it being something serious. \n\nThanks in advance!"

No asthma.\n\n\n*Here\u2019s some reasons I am concerned something might be wrong with my thyroid. I just would like some different opinions, as I\u2019m not really sure what to think about any of this anymore.*\n\n\n**TLDR;  Symptoms come and go. (Thyroid swelling, eyesight fluctuations, hunger.) If this is normal I\u2019d just like to know because I feel like I\u2019m crazy. I\u2019m not sure what\u2019s been causing my thyroid to swell, then return back to normal.**\n\n1. Saturday morning (7/27) called Tricare nurses hotline - the lower front/left side of my throat was sore and swollen and could be felt. \nThey said go to the ER. Saturday night (when I could finally get there) the swelling was gone, they said call my PCM.\n\n*I used to have what I thought was severe allergies, because my throat (right where my thyroid is) would be swollen. Always on the left side, always would feel like I have a sandspur in my throat. Nurses would tell me I had the flu, but I would often feel better the next day.*\n\n2. Muscle stiffness and pain in the morning (or anytime I\u2019m still for long periods)\nProgressively worsened. Started in feet (that I noticed) in 2017. \nNow it\u2019s in my feet, ankles, fingers and wrists. I will sometimes lose my balance in the morning because it\u2019s hard to stand. It goes away within an hour of waking up and moving.\nSome mornings are worse than others.\nI don\u2019t often wake up naturally anymore, I wake up because my muscles hurt.\n\nSaw PCM yesterday, 7/30 said I had plantar fasciitis, but couldn\u2019t explain the pain in my hands. Gave me some exercise and stretching sheets and sent me home.\n\n3. My optometrist  has voiced concern over my eyesight fluctuating paired with eye pain and is concerned I\u2019m either diabetic (I\u2019m not) or something is wrong with my thyroid. (I don\u2019t know.)\n\nAnd regarding diabetes, my blood sugar this weekend was 166 after eating an apple (2 hours after) and but 121 after stuffing my face full of donuts (2 hours after). It got down to 69 at one point this week. I\u2019ve taken a glucose test back in 2014 and I wasn\u2019t diabetic.\n\n4. I am often excessively hungry and thirsty. Sometimes I can\u2019t eat enough despite being full, and I will often wake up with dry mouth because I\u2019m so thirsty. I don\u2019t drink soda, (rarely drink) caffeine or a lot of juices. I typically always have a water bottle with me. Thirsty = all the time, hungry = sometimes.\n\n5.  I\u2019ve had ongoing stomach problems I\u2019ve seen my PCM for but not gotten any answers. Constipation mostly, things like broccoli, cucumbers and bell peppers were making me sick and was thought to be some side effects that stayed behind from some birth control I was on back in 2014. \n\n6. I\u2019ve upped my cardio recently and have been eating better/less but I\u2019ve been either gaining weight or maintaining.\n\n7. My periods are heavy. I used to have them on crazy cycles (either every 14 days or 35+ days) Since my pap has always been fine I\u2019ve been told it\u2019s normal. Right now my cycle for this particular month has been 20 days apart.\n\n8. My skin and hair have become so incredibly dry, I could sew my hair into a rain jacket it practically repels water.

I didnt. \nNow its been a few years, still dont know what ever happened to my knee just that it never healed properly and hurt for years after the incident. \n\n6 months ago it just started going back to extreme pain whenever i did anything. That progressed to now constant daily pain no matter what i do. Its stiff and burning, sharp and just really uncomfortable.

So im thinking of going to the ER to get an MRI and officially see whats wrong with my knee before I go into PT on the 14th of August.\n\nBecause honestly i dont know what this knee pain is. It sounds like meniscus tear or some cartilage thing. It pops and cracks everytime I bend it at all, its burning hot sometimes and always hurts at least at a 5 or more. But right now im pushing 9. I dont want to waste their time with a non emergency and i dont want to be in the ER for hours just to be given some meds. At least a brace would be nice.

He has never been the same since. He screams in pain constantly. It would hit him in attacks he would shake all over his feet sweating a lot. It would either be when he was getting a feed or having a bowel movement. We started seeing all of his specialist and none of them could pinpoint what it could be that was hurting him. We finally narrowed it down to something gastro related. At this time he had a g button. We had to start slowing his feeds or sometimes stop them. Gastro did an EGD and found a very large hiatal hernia. We started with nexium that seemed to help some. Then he started hurting again they tried bethanacol. That has never seemed to help. \n\nJune 10th we went in for a Nissen Fundoplication because we thought the problems were from the hiatal hernia. He was unable to have the procedure because of his severe scoliosis. Instead they moved the stoma and put a gastrojejunal tube. \n\nA couple of days later he developed pneumonia he coughed very violently and his incision split open. He had to have emergency surgery 5 days after original surgery. They put retention sutures in. A couple of days later he developed ARDS. Over that time his blood pressure would get extremely high and heart rate like he was having the attacks even sedated.\n\nHe was on ventilator for 21 days. When he woke up he was extremely fussy as they were weaning him from drugs. When they sent him home July 15 he never stopped screaming. He got himself so worked up he would have a seizure. We thought it was from Ativan withdrawals.\n\nOn the 26th he had a bad seizure from being so upset. I had them take him to ER by ambulance. We found out when his feeds were stopped he was back to his happy self before all this started. Then started up when feeds were started back. We then tried Pedialyte at half the rate and he still screamed. \n\nI've noticed when he gets his meds in g tube. He has a lot of reflux from it. He had an upper GI with small bowel follow through. It showed a lot of gas and reflux. The j tube is in correct position. Abdominal ultrasound everything was fine except a small polyp on gallbladder. They said that would not cause the pain. \n\nTommorow he goes for a PICC line to start TPN. He will then go for abdominal CT. Doctors have no idea why this is happening. Please if anyone has any ideas they would be greatly appreciated.\n\nUpdate: CT results came back normal. So far nothing out of normal on Labs also."

        "reddit": "Long story short, I work a lot, and don't sleep well due to someone snoring. I also workout just a little bit every other day. I generally have zero anxiety, only the few times I've accidentally overdosed on my prescription stimulant, and weed, sometimes together (the weed was supposed to mellow it out, apparently weed doesn't work the same on me).\n\nSo this was going on for a week. I thought I had just pulled a bunch of muscles, from lifting some heavy in one arm a few times, and just in general working out and doing reps that always push against the edge of my range of motion. So maybe I was already over stretched a bit, and probably kept not warming up and stretching properly. I'm only 30, good shape, don't do anything heavy really, just all moderate weights.\n\nAnyway, I thought I was having a bad week. For a few seconds, randomly, I'd be walking around at work and feel short bursts of very sharp pains, like sharp stones somewhere in my guts. It also felt like I pulled almost every muscle on one side of my body. I specifically felt, and still feel, something that goes from one spot behind my shoulder blade, through my insides, touching my chest, going up one side of my lungs and throat, and makes some nerves tingle in my lower jaw near my teeth.\n\nI also can't lean forward, lean my weight on my arms too long (causing my chest, abs, obliques, etc to flex), can't look down for too long, or I start to get pain and tightness and stuff in a portion of my torso, inside, inches from my heart.\n\nYes, it does cause me to have mild anxiety when it happens, but I usually drink water and talk myself out of it. Even without the sharp pains, I still feel it all there all the time. \n\nI have not taken my prescription stimulants in almost half a year, I only ever smoked weed and drank alcohol a few times this whole year, and rarely did it ever all the other years. I am a clean and active dude, I study, I do things. I am aware of the real world, and have come to know how things like panic attacks can affect what I think and feel for nearly 30 years now. I am no stranger to anxiety, panic attacks, breaking bones, or straining muscles. I used to lift heavy and be a home and office mover, I just toned it down these days just to maintain a decent level of strength and overall fitness.\n\nSo anyway, I went to see the doctor through work, and before the dude even touches me, he just listens to me describing all my pain and stiffness and stuff. I told him how the pain and tension, especially the tension that seems to make a thick 3D line going from my back to my guts, and chest, up my lungs and throat, etc. I told him how I did feel a little scared because even after I waited a WEEK and let my muscles heal, and felt them heal, that I could not even do a one minute workout with my 10lb dumbbells (I can curl and shoulder press 40-45lbs in each hand for half a minute, and walk around with them for endurance training for another half a minute, per set), without all that pain coming back minutes later. I told him how I also felt a weird pain and pressure in my throat or lungs, the same burnt feeling you get after inhaling a lot of weed or cigarette smoke. \n\nI *DESCRIBED* that it felt like I had a growth in there, as it gave me this constant pressure on my lungs, making me breathe similarly how it feels when I am submerged in water up to my neck (the pressure it puts on your lungs), and my throat, and gave me the constant urge to try to burp it out, like a gas that never went away. \n\nJust overall, it felt like something was in there, along with the strained line of nerves/muscles going through that area.\n\nI was merely describing what I felt, so they'd know where to look and what to look for in the scans. Without even touching me, even acknowledging what I possibly did to strain things, no scans at all, he tells me it's mostly all psychosomatic. He also said that there is nothing that connects from my back to my neck.... Uhhh... Everything from my neck to my back literally is connected, and it's obvious the more weight you try to carry on one side. Try to pick up the heaviest dumbbell you can lift with one hand and tell me that you don't feel nearly every muscle in your body flex to support it.... So he dismissed it.\n\nThen he X-rayed my back and said my back is fine, mostly for my employer to know that I have no spine issues. **He slightly acknowledged that I might have a little strain, but kept pushing the point that 99% of my sensations and pain were all psychosomatic**. Even after the X-ray showed my intestines totally full of shit (might have explained the moving sharp pains, besides my strained muscles and tendons, also I have been eating more at work lately, for my weight, but not much honestly), he just kept repeating that it's my anxiety, and I should see a therapist and get some anti anxiety medication....\n\nI am still going back for some work compensation approved PT, and hopefully a damn MRI or some kind of scan to actually see my muscles and stuff....\n\nI just want to know, Docs... How the hell common is it that most pain people feel is just from the fear and anxiety from being hurt in the first place? Can I seriously cause myself to feel that much pain and pressure just by thinking about it? Seriously? In the same exact locations, without even thinking about it most of the time as well?\n\nSeriously, I'm as sober as a Mormon, and as healthy as a college athlete still. I study. I don't have PTSD or generalized anxiety disorder. I feel perfectly physically and mentally fine 99% of the time, except in cases where I really fucking hurt myself and think I actually need to see a doctor. \n\nWhat class in medical school teaches people that most pain, even from putting daily strain and further damage on long term injuries, is just psychosomatic and just caused by anxiety?"

And to round my pretty list off, agoraphobia. \n\nWhy I\u2019m here: \n\nTwo years ago, I got sick. To make a long story short, I basically have been living in a constant state of panic for two years. I learned to adapt and in the meantime I was diagnosed with POTS and put on a very, very high dosage of anti-depressant to try to combat my fear of being alone. \n\nDuring these two years, I\u2019ve been questioning the validity of the POTS/Anxiety diagnoses. In the two years, I saw three different doctors - all with the same results showing up in my blood work, and only one pursuing it. The latest doctor saw the trend (Low Cortisol, Low ACTH; Low T4/T3, Normal TSH) and sent me for a pituitary MRI &amp; there it was, a functioning 4 mm pituitary tumor in my brain.\n\nI\u2019m on hormone replacements now and have been for a month. Things are getting better but they\u2019re gonna take time. \n\nMy question, however, is what now? My doctor seems to be satisfied with me just being on steroids and hormone replacement while we (literally) wait for the tumor to grow enough to cause me to lose my vision. At that point, we will begin to pursue surgery. \n\nI am just supposed to live knowing that I have a brain tumor (albeit small and likely benign) in my head? We\u2019re monitoring it every six months for growth because it\u2019s pushing my pituitary over to the side. \n\nI just guess I don\u2019t really understand why the first plan of action isn\u2019t to remove the source of all my problems, but to instead medicate me in order to quiet the tumor? \n\nI don\u2019t know. I got diagnosed a month ago and it\u2019s finally starting to sink in and I just don\u2019t really understand. Everyone thinks the doctor is a godsend because she found it (even though she didn\u2019t think it was there in the first place) and so I don\u2019t want to admit I want someone else to look at my tumor and my case. I don\u2019t even know if this is the right forum. \n\nI\u2019m sorry, I just have a tumor in my brain and it\u2019s so hard to deal with when I\u2019m alone and able to think solely about it"

I only take albuterol for asthma when needed, and allergy medicine sometimes\n\nEvery once in a while, maybe once every 2 weeks, when I turn my head (usually to the right), I experience piercing pain in the back of my head. It always occurs in the exact same spot. I will attempt to describe it as best I can:\n\nIt feels distinctly in the shape of a line, extending about 4 inches down the back-left of my head. It happens in varying degrees of severity. At the lowest severity, it is a dull and sudden pain that fades quickly. At the highest severity, it is a violent, stabbing pain; at first, it feels extremely hot, then suddenly cold, then it almost feels as if water is being dripped on my head. In these cases, the pain takes minutes to wear off- it feels like I was burned. It\u2019s usually severe enough that I yell involuntarily, or am nearly knocked over. \n\nIn every case, however, my head is jerked back to a neutral position. Sometimes it feels more like a push, but when it hurts the most, it\u2019s a snapping motion. Feels like my neck is forcibly reset. \n\nThis has actually been occurring as long as I can remember. I recall bringing it up to my mom one time, when she told me a similar thing has happened to her before. However, over the last couple years, it has increased slowly in frequency. I\u2019m making this post because it happened days ago, and again today- and today, it was the worst it\u2019s ever been. Searing, intense pain. \n\nI\u2019ve always thought of it as \u201ca nerve being pinched,\u201d because that\u2019s what it *kind of feels like,* but I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m talking about. \n\nI\u2019d really appreciate any input- and yes, I\u2019m bringing this up to my physician next time I see him.

My thought was that I was hit in the testicles by a golf club and that's what caused it, but I'm not so sure after some research though I'm not that well versed on the topic. An incision was made on the top right portion of my genital region. They explained that if the surgery was not completed my testicles would swell to potentially enormous size (they had pictures and let me tell you, that scared little ole me back then.)\n\nSo at this point it's 11 years later and roughly 3 years after the surgery I've noticed a lump forming on my left testicle which was the one that was operated on. It's a very soft kind of tissue. I feel like if I squeeze hard enough I'll rip it. It seems to be forming on my testicle, or possibly where my testicle and the tube connect? It's hard to tell. It also periodically hurts and it's at random, and I never touch it to the point to cause any pain. I'll just be walking and it'll hurt, and then go away and it feels like nothing happen.\n\nAs I'm writing this I'm noticing that the lumps have grown up the left testicle and into my genital region, about half an inch in is the deepest. It's along almost the entire length of my left testicle's tube, but it's very thinned out. 95% of it is just the large flap of it stuck to the testicle itself. It's a very small region of the testicle that's effected too. The flab itself takes up a good amount of space but it's connected to roughly 10% of my entire left testicle. The rest of the testicle is free of any bumps and reacts to interaction in the same way as the right one. I don't have any issues ejaculating and it never hurts too and neither does urination. It has also grown a half a centimeter in length at max.\n\nOne possible cause is roughly 3 years after the surgery I had become interested in bondage play with my testicles and although I never did it anywhere near close to cause pain, it is still something to consider. I also haven't encountered any further testicular trauma or the like.\n\nI'm sorry if this is poorly worded. A 22 hour bus trip is exhausting when 14 of those hours is spent in a single bus station. If I need to be more detailed tell me and I'll provide anything needed to help."

I desperately need some help in figuring out what has been happening to me over the past two months, as it has completed upended my life and left me afraid for the future.\n\nThough the acute stage of what I have been dealing with began on May 30th, I do think there was something of a prodrome after trying my best to recall the weeks leading up to it. In the 1-2 weeks leading up to that day, I noticed myself getting WAY more (physically) anxious at things than I normally do. This was strange to me, as I do not have a history of crippling anxiety at all, just some mild social anxiety and mild transient depression that I have always been able to deal with on my own. One example of this was when I was buying a gift for my girlfriend's birthday and I began to hyperventilate in the store. This was an odd feeling as buying gifts for anyone has never caused me anxiety - and moreover, I was only feeling physical effects of anxiety and was not psychologically distressed. It only manifested as sweating, fast breath, and slightly elevated heart rate. Unfortunately, I did not think much of it and kept on. I also developed a cold/allergies and had been taking a number of antihistamines and nasal sprays - I think on the 29th I had taken loratadine and flonase in the morning, afrin, benadryl, and nyquil in the evening (maybe combining all those medicines contributed to this? I don't know).\n\nOn the night of **May 29th**, I was lying in my room reading before  sleep when my dad made a comment wondering why I hadn't planned an internship or job for the summer and how I was going to be behind my peers who had those lined up already. This has been a sore spot for me as of late, as I had not secured anything for the summer and instead had just been relaxing and lounging. I had been feeling some anxiety around this, to the point that I avoided talking about it with anyone. After my dad made that comment, suddenly self-loathing and fears that my future was going to bleak and embarrassing began to consume me. Instead of feeling anxious, however, I felt horribly depressed for the rest of that night - maybe the worst acute depression I have ever felt. This too was strange to me, as I had never ever felt depression that intensely - it didn't feel like \"me\" if that makes sense. I have intimate experience with my own type of depression and this felt like such a departure from that, like it was induced by something and not psychogenic. I did manage to cry myself to sleep, my final thoughts before sleep being that I would feel better tomorrow.\n\nThen comes **May 30th**, the day when the worst of this all started. I woke up feeling normal enough, thankful that those strange feelings of the evening prior had passed. A couple hours later, out of the blue while I was watching TV, I felt a wave of horrible anxious energy course through my body. It even felt like the come-up of a big dose of LSD - so much so that I started wondering if I had somehow been dosed, even though that was impossible. The panic set in and all I could do was pace through my house. I had consumed a liter of tea that morning, so I rationalized this as having a bad reaction to the caffeine. This helped me not completely breakdown, but I was very much suffering from a constant sense of panic. I figured it would pass and I soldiered on. \n\nI only slept for a few hours the next night, but when I rose on the morning of **May 31st** I would say I felt roughly normal again. I had a dental appointment that day so I began my drive to his office and immediately noticed the world and my body felt \"off\" during my drive over there. I figured it was just a lingering effect of my caffeine/antihistamine panic from the day before and thought I could continue to push through it. The dentist has never caused me anxiety, I actually find it quite relaxing normally so I was looking forward to getting in the chair. However, as soon as I sat down in the chair to get worked on my heart started pounding and I began to feel horrible. I told the hygienist I needed to stand up and she helped me out of the chair and back into the waiting room. I was in the midst of a panic attack (which I have never experienced before), I realized. I sipped cool water and sat with some of the employees for about 20 minutes and I was slowly able to calm myself a little bit. However, a horrible anxiety lingered like I have never felt before - it completely gripped me. I had to call my dad to come pick me up. When I got home I was still feeling that horrible anxiety, seemingly directed at nothing. All I could do again, was pace around my house and hope the feelings would subside. That continued into the next day - sitting down felt impossible, as I was completely agitated and restless. I couldn't focus on anything, including TV or simple reddit posts. My appetite was non-existent, and I was nearly convinced that I was going to die or I was going insane.\n\nOn **June 2**, I visited an urgent care after waking up and still feeling horrible anxiety, restlessness, inability to concentrate or think, and strange sensations in my body. They ran some simple tests on me, including blood tests (thyroid, Lyme, electrolytes) and a chest x-ray. I was given a prescription of Xanax and told to follow up with my family doc (PCP). I only took a few doses of the Xanax over the next few days as I was very afraid of developing a dependence. It helped with the restlessness, but I still did not feel like myself at all.\n\nOn **June 4th**, because my symptoms had not abated even with Xanax administration, I went to the ER. They performed some more blood tests on me and discharged me with \"palpitations\" and told me to go see a cardiologist (which I did, completely fruitless appointment). My blood tests showed nothing remarkable outside a past Epstein-Barr virus infection (for which i was not symptomatic, apparently).\n\nOver the next few days, the horrible anxiety slowly became more manageable, but I still could not concentrate for more than a couple seconds (this made it very hard to communicate with doctors), had terrible dizziness, severe short term memory impairment, barely any appetite, horrible brain fog, trouble falling and staying asleep, nausea, crying spells, uncontrollable shaking, transient body pains, muscle twitches, diarrhea, and frequent urination.\n\nAlso, around that time a sense of detachment from reality (which I found to be the most distressing symptom) began to set in. I realize now that this is probably derealization/depersonalization (dp/dr)  brought on as a result of my incredibly anxious state. I focused on this symptom for a while (still suffering from the others, however). \n\nI suffered through the anxiety/dp/dr state for a week or so, holed up in my house or in the care of my girlfriend. On **June 11th** I went to visit my primary care doc. Within five minutes of explaining the situation, he told me this was simple anxiety and wrote me a prescription for Lexapro. I was wary to take the Lexapro, and decided to hold off on it for a while to see if my symptoms would improve over time. \n\nIn the next couple weeks I was happy to see my appetite return to 80% or so, and the horrible brain fog improved maybe 2% each day. I eventually gained enough confidence to drive again, even making some 2 hour drives to visit my girlfriend while she took a summer class at our university. The transient panic became more infrequent, the baseline anxiety was reduced and I was finally able to sit down more than a few minutes again. The shaking, nausea, and muscle twitches mostly subsided, and I felt a bit better. Maybe from being 10% of myself to 35%. This was encouraging to me. \n\nHowever, the DP/DR was still strong and pervasive, and my focus shifted to that. I felt it was slowly subsiding, however, a weekend trip to an amusement park caused it to flare up again. Sick of this sensation, I made an appointment with a psychiatrist and resolved to begin the course of Lexapro my primary care doctor gave me.\n\nOn **July 2nd**, I took 5 mg of Lexapro. Within 2 hours, I had an even worse panic attack than the one that started all of this. It truly felt like I had taken LSD again (even down to the heightened sense of taste), which was horrifying. The next few days I felt a an extreme dysphoria and lost all the progress I had made recovering from the first panic attack. My appetite was gone again, I lost sensation in my body, I had horrible diarrhea and nausea and couldn't stop sweating. When the worst of that subsided, I was left feeling like a zombie with no emotions and barely any bodily sensation.\n\nOn **July 13th**, I saw a psychiatrist. I explained to him my whole ordeal, including the horrific reaction to Lexapro. He thought this was panic disorder (which I am unsure about since I have never been a panicky person), and seemed incredulous towards the idea that Lexapro could have caused any lingering issues. His only idea was to give me another SSRI (Zoloft) at a very small dose. I told him that I was incredibly wary of taking an SSRI again and that I might come back in some months if I do not improve with therapy and time.\n\nIn the next few weeks I felt some of my emotions return and have been feeling generally better, though some body numbness continues. Focusing on the DP/DR, I read online that the only way out of it is to give it as little attention as possible, which I did. Slowly, I felt the fog lifting and more of myself appearing again. I still have horrible brain fog, but much more connected to reality instead of feeling like I was so detached. \n\nEventually the dp/dr lifted near completely, but as that happened I realized what it was covering up - the horrible anxiety that started this all. I was excited to feel more normal but I also noticed that I felt this baseline anxiety and panic so much more intensely. It lasted about a day (July 30th) before the anxiety caused the dp/dr to come back. It was strange in that the anxiety I felt did not feel focused on anything external but rather again was just this constant unshakable feeling.\n\nI have been in therapy for a few weeks and will continue my new healthy lifestyle changes (cleaner diet, frequent exercise, and more socializing). However, I am afraid this might not be enough. I go back to my university in a few weeks and I fear that I might not be able to perform well due to the trouble concentrating, bad memory, and intermittent panic. This whole ordeal has also put something of a strain on my relationships, and I can't help but fear what many more months of this might entail.\n\nSo, I turn to everyone here for some guidance and potentially answers. **Given the symptoms and progression, do you all think this is just a sudden-onset anxiety disorder, despite no family or personal history? Or is there something physically causing this, like something autoimmune, endocrine, dysautonomia, or perhaps an infection? Are there any tests I should get, specialists I should see? Or medications that can be recommended for my anxiety given my horrible reaction to Lexapro? Does anyone have any recommendations for coping with these symptoms and their effects on my life?** I am desperate and really would like some with these questions.\n\nFor the sake of greater clarity, I will list the symptoms I have been dealing with, both currently and earlier, as well as what has helped me.\n\n**Symptoms that have mostly subsided**\n\n* Restlessness\n\n* 24/7 anxiety\n\n* weird sensation of energy in the body \n\n* uncontrollable body shaking\n\n* muscle twitches, especially in face\n\n* muscle pains\n\n* diarrhea\n\n* nausea\n\n* loss of appetite\n\n* frequent urination\n\n* heightened sense of smell\n\n* insomnia\n\n* crying spells\n\n* dry mouth\n\n* sensory oversensitivity (sound and touch)\n\n* trouble hearing\n\n* sensation that I'm falling\n\n* constant tachycardia\n\n**Symptoms that remain:**    \n\n* feeling as if I'm in a dream (derealization?)\n\n* feeling less connected with, or settled into my body (lingering lexapro effect or depersonalization?)\n\n* horrible anxiety when the dp/dr lifts\n\n* transient mild panic attacks, even when i'm in a dp/dr episode\n\n* trouble concentrating\n\n* severe forgetfulness\n\n* dizziness\n\n* head pressure\n\n* eyes can't adjust to darkness at all\n\n* highly altered sense of time (it flies by)\n\n* severe brain fog\n\n* early awakening (usually between 4 and 6 am)\n\n* occasional tachycardia\n\n**Things that have helped me:**\n\n* playing tennis\n\n* socializing\n\n* weightlifting\n\n* aerobic exercise\n\n* distractions, keeping busy\n\n* reading about how this is temporary and will pass\n\nPlease help me, I am sick of this and really just want to get back to living.

Should I see my general practitioner, as that wait time is shorter?  Should I go to the hospital?  Was this all because I was really high?

It occurs maybe once every two weeks, sometimes a little more, sometimes a little less. The episode has a pretty familiar pattern, where I'll go to bed and start to drift off within half an hour, only to suddenly feel like I'm jolted awake. After this I find it very difficult to return to my drowsy state, and feel completely alert and awake. Normally when this happens I try to return to sleep but nothing happens for a few hours, so it gets to about 2AM or 3AM and I take a sleeping aid (nytol), which typically gets me off to sleep within an hour or so.\n\nI've looked into some of the most common causes of insomnia. I know arthritis is a common cause and I think I have that (I've had pretty constant back and neck pain ever since my mid-teens), but it doesn't strike me as being that. I manage the symptoms quite well, and I normally don't feel any more discomfort on my nights of insomnia compared to other nights. I know stress and anxiety can also be a cause, but again I don't think it's that because my stress/anxiety hasn't really increased in the past year. \n\nGiven that it seems to follow a particular pattern (i.e. drifting off before jolting awake), would that suggest a particular cause? I'm wondering if it might be something physiological."

        "reddit": "Hey, I have a problem. I have a higher normal blood pressure but my problem is my phobia of taking them. Just feeling my pulse gives me anxiety and I don't really know why. When I do a test, I usually get around 140/90 but with a BPM of 100+ while having a minor panic attack. I think my blood pressure is higher than the average but I don't feel that I get an accurate number when I panic every time I'm about to do it. I'm 24 years old, male, weigh 83-84 kg at 185 cm. I don't smoke and seldom drink. I walk at least 70 km every week and I exercise 2-3 times per week with free weights or body weight (I'll go to the gym soon again). My diet is healthy too but I guess I could eat even better. Being a Swedish-Italian, my diet is mainly mediterranean consisting of pasta, fish, meat, seafood, nuts, fruit, vegetables, olive oil, garlic, fresh herbs and so on. When I need something quick to eat, I usually do a spaghetti with olive oil, garlic, peperoncino and parsley. I don't usually eat something unhealthy do get it into me quickly, if you get what I mean.\n\nOk, so my problem is that I can't handle the blood pressure monitor. I've really tried to calm myself down and listen to music and stuff but it's awful. It'll probably keep on showing 140/90 and I suppose my blood pressure is at the higher end of the spectrum naturally, despite a healthy lifestyle. My father has hypertension which he's medicated for so it runs in the family (my mother and sister both have 100/70 or so though). That's the reason why I realized my pressure is above average too, because of my dad's monitor here at home.\n\nIf I only could overcome this irrational fear of feeling my pulse so tremendously hard in my arm, I could get an accurate result. Does anyone else share my fear of this shit? It's probably my worst fear of everything I've experienced and I'm usually not an anxious person and panic attacks are completely foreign to me besides that one time you wrap my arm around a blood pressure monitor. Jesus...\n\nI read something about a 24 hour monitor, how does that work? Is it less \"harsh\"? Are there any ways to measure blood pressure without squeezing my arm? I mean everything is digitalized nowadays. Could I take something that'd make me calm and then do the test at a hospital? \n\nSince my lifestyle is decent and I don't have any issues - should I just keep on living my life, not giving a damn about this until I'm older? I could try to exercise even more, eat even better and so on, but besides that?\n\nTL;DR: I have phobia of measuring blood pressure because of the sensation of feeling my pulse so concentrated at one place and it's like my breathing stops to function. Thus, my results don't feel 100% accurate when I measure at home. Are the 24 hour monitors more relaxed in the way they function? Because I can't handle the normal tests well at all, it gives me something close to a panic attack.\n\nThanks!"

For the last 10 months or so, I've been having an issue where sometimes I will feel like I consistently need to use the toilet to pee - even after going. If I give in it'll often be in small amounts, sometimes clear small amounts. There is no pain, no issues with stream, and no discoloration. However, while not gone, it has gotten exponentially better in the last 1.5 months or so, roughly at the same time as when I went to my last urologist appointment. I've seen two urologists in different cities, I have had several urine tests, several bladder ultrasounds with Post-void residuals, as well as having my prostate checked. All are clear and indicate there's nothing wrong. The only thing I haven't gotten 'tested' for is interstitial cystitis, but the urologist said as a young male with no pain, that is highly unlikely. There's also nothing that seems to make it better or worse. Sometimes, ejaculation may cause it to be worse (for example I pee, often a decent amount, maybe 2-3 times in 2-3 hours after), but this is not every time. I also do *not* wake up in the middle of the night to use the bathroom. It's very erratic lately. The only thing I can think of as being a pattern is that I have recently graduated, and I am looking for work. When I am home all day and not busy, searching for jobs, I often feel as though it is worse. When I have busy days and I am out of my house a lot, it seems to be better. Could this indicate that my urinary symptoms are completely psychological -- anxiety induced if you will? Could it be that I am literally so hyper-focused on bladder sensations that a normal person wouldn't even notice what I am complaining about? Thank you to anyone who can help!\n\nEDIT: To add, while some days I may use the toilet more often, it is almost never more than 7 or so times. So it is still within a normal range, I'm simply uncomfortable all the time."

Unfortunately my last doctors visit was just a few hours before this started to happen so I wasn't able to ask my doctor."

A few days ago, my mother seemingly experienced a minor stroke and/or TIA. Her speech suddenly became severely slurred. Half her face was slightly (but not majorly) droopy. She was having a panic attack, talking extremely slurred/incomprehensibly, and tried to walk but ended up walking into a wall. She was taken into accident &amp; emergency. She was told that they suspected she had a TIA. As well as this, she was told the stroke team would contact her to see her the next day. She was given aspirin + blood pressure medication (her blood pressure was over 200). She also had a CT/brain scan which apparently showed nothing abnormal.\n\nIt has been several days since. Unfortunately, after lots and lots of chasing them up, the stroke team she was meant to see said they are short-staffed so they can't see her for another week or two (which is terrible, in my opinion). Minor strokes/TIA symptoms are supposed to stop after 24hrs from everything I've read online. However, every day my mother is still suffering. One moment she can talk normally - the next, her speech will be suddenly and abruptly extremely slurred, which happens several times a day. Her balance/coordination are still poor - she keeps walking into walls &amp; has to suddenly sit down often which is not normal for her. She's been extremely tired and lethargic. In the days leading up to her TIA, she was notably abnormally tired sleeping as soon as she got home from work - which, again, is not normal for her. She's also repeatedly complaining of headaches. She's struggling to live life at the moment, basically, and her reoccurring slurred speech every day is really worrying me. We are going to take her to the doctors tomorrow morning. I'm concerned this is only going to exacerbate and culminate with major strokes, but it's bad enough already.\n\nWhat's going on? Why is she still having symptoms days later? Is she constantly having minor strokes/TIAs? She's really not herself, not well, and I'm so sad &amp; worried. At the moment I'm basically babysitting her. This is all so sudden and out of the blue. She's 55. She is diabetic (type 2). She once had heart surgery (ablation therapy for SVT).\n\nI apologise profusely if I have failed to follow rules or omitted details yet again - here's hoping this is finally sufficient.  \n\n\nEDIT: I forgot to mention that her handwriting has also notably deteriorated.\n\nThanks."

At this time, I began to want to start eating much healthier. In a matter of a few days, I increased my consumption of fruits by a lot. I went from one piece of fruit to as many as four to six apples, one to two bananas, and whatever else I wanted per day.  I began to eat a **LOT** of fruit.\n\nI'm no doctor, so I'm not sure if this caused it, but this is also when I started dealing with constipation. I wasn't able to defecate, just like that. In a matter of a few weeks, my ability to defecate comfortably and easily disappeared. I continued to consume a diet heavy in fruits - specifically, apples. My fruit diet continued till about February when I read a thread on Reddit about this man who had stopped eating fruits high in fructose and his acne went away. You see, I had been dealing with cystic acne as well right between my eyebrows. I cut out apples and other fruits, and my cystic acne went away within a week. **(I'd offer up pictures displaying the cystic acne or the welts I describe later, but I took no pictures of them and am now on an elimination diet that makes the skin issues more manageable.)**\n\nI also had been dealing with other skin issues. I'd have red welts that looked similar to big pimples springing up across my forehead. I began an elimination diet, and I discovered that I was breaking out due to three things: dairy, gluten, and eggs. However, before I was eating an incredible amount of fruit, I had no acne, and I had none of the food sensitivities I do now. I could casually eat whatever I wanted without the repercussions I sadly face today. Being my age and not being able to eat these foods can really get disheartening sometimes. Baking my family a cake and not being able to eat it with them or not being able to eat pizza with my buds really bums me out\n\nWe visited a gastroenterologist who basically said what I knew he'd say. He instructed me to take fiber gummies that would give me 12 grams of fiber per day, as well as to drink milk of magnesia, and increase the dose as needed to have soft and regular stools. Except, it doesn't really work. If I drink the magnesia the night before and take gummies in the morning, I can go the whole day without defecating. Coffee tends to help - but when I drink it every day, the effects wear off. This predicament is strange because the doctor predicted the opposite would occur - that I'd soon be regular.\n\nI got tested for celiac disease and thyroid levels, both came back negative - nothing wrong there. Though I'm pretty sure I read somewhere you have to eat gluten for a while up to the test date or you might get a false negative? I had also gotten tested for celiac as a younger child and it came back negative.\n\nI have a few hypotheses. I'm a naturally curious person, and though it really sucks sometimes, viewing myself as a sort of science experiment where I have to figure out the problem and solve it takes a pretty big load off my psyche, especially when I blame myself for my situation. Here are my hypotheses:\n\n**Fructose malabsorption**\n\n**Gut Inflammation**\n\n**Altered Gut Microbiome**\n\n**Increased Gut Permeability**\n\n**SIBO**\n\nI'm not really sure - these are just some ideas I've thought of regarding my condition. I hope anyone who is knowledgeable on this topic can help me, as I feel like my quality of life has really gone down over the past months. Anything helps! I truly appreciate anyone who can offer me some advice. If you have any other questions that may help you in narrowing it down, feel free to ask. I can write up detailed answers for you. Thanks!!!\n\nEdit: Some things I didn't talk about: I'm active, working out about 4 times a week, I drink adequate amounts of water, and I meditate regularly so stress doesn't tend to be an issue. The gastroenterologist diagnosed me with chronic idiopathic constipation. After every meal, I deal with heavy bloating. \\*\\*\\*added SIBO to my hypothesises\\*\\*\\*"

Full disclosure, I'm an MS4, but no prior hx of attempted self-dx. I'm very active and usually have a lot of energy, especially on rotations where I'm getting enough sleep and nutrition. Thanks to the blessed land of M4 I have been hiking a lot this summer, and have pulled a number of ticks off myself (deer ticks and Lone Star). None that I have found have been on &gt;8hr, but I am not the most diligent about checking.\n\nSeveral weeks ago I had onset of fever to 101.2, headache, nausea and severe diffuse myalgia. Pertinent negatives: no rashes, no rhinorrhea, no sore throat, no vomiting, no abdominal pain, no lower GI symptoms, no cough, no sick contacts, no joint pain at that time. \n\nAfter a few days I was feeling better to the point where I was back to work, and didn't think much of it until a couple days later when the low-grade fever returned (T 100.6) and I started having aches in my muscles again and in my joints - including weird ones, like my left elbow. No swelling or erythema in any joint, just aches. Ibuprofen helps a little bit, mostly in keeping the temp down. I'm used to post-workout type aches-so-good, but these feel more like when I've had the flu. \n\nAt this point my preceptors mantra of \"summer flu is tick-borne illness\" is in my head and I made an appointment at my gen med clinic (timeline: 8 days from symptom onset). I saw a brand-new NP, who I unfortunately did not have an awesome experience with. She said a number of things that didn't give me a lot of confidence in her - told me that if I didn't have a rash there's \"less than 1 percent chance it's lyme\" , \"treatment is 8 weeks of doxy\" (what?), didn't know what test to order, didn't know when the results will be back and refused to find out, etc. Despite this she insisted I get tested for lyme that day as well as retested in 3 weeks - I clarified the timeline several times because I will be leaving for an away rotation between 3-4 weeks from my original test, but &gt;4 weeks from symptom onset.\n\nSince then, I've had chills and sweats intermittently but no true fevers, but I've been feeling generally... crappy? Malaise, headaches, weird joint and muscle aches despite not being able to work out as much, low appetite which is very unusual for me. I've been trying to ignore it and I'm still able to do most of my normal life things, just a little bit slower and more miserable I guess? I take tylenol or ibuprofen when I feel super achey, and thankfully I've been on chill rotations so my sleep and diet are good. I was planning to suck it up until I get retested before I head out to my away sub-I.\n\nTwo things have sparked my post today: the NP messaged me yesterday telling me that she won't retest until 6 weeks after my first test, at which point I will be in the middle of an audition rotation across the country. And then after feeling more achey and tired than normal all day and needing a nap despite 9 hours of sleep, I'm starting to run a low fever again this afternoon (100.5).\n\nMy thought is, obviously this could be something else (hey, autoimmune alarm bells, thanks for joining us), but the clinical picture follows and I have a lot of resident friends who would happily write me for 2 weeks of doxy. With an important rotation coming up, would it be totally unreasonable to \"self\" treat presumed lyme, hopefully feel better, and if not I can follow up once I get back to this coast? I hate not following the rules and possibly misusing antibiotics and being a frustrating patient, but I really need this to get better if possible. Looking for outside opinions and I accept any other suggestions, thanks so much."

(I am now 26.) In 2017, I was invited to join some family members who were planning to run a 10K at Disneyworld in 02/2018. I began my training toward the end of 2017. At the time, my exercise routine consisted of some running, maybe once a week or once every two weeks. But I mainly focused on some yoga, some dance aerobics workouts, and many interval workouts that would alternate bursts of active weight lifting with bursts of cardio activity. I typically did this about four days a week. To train for this race, all I did was increase the amount of days per week I was running to 2-3x/week, and increase the number of days per week I was working out from 4 to 5. In other words, my routine did change, but it's not like I started trying to run three miles a day after never running or working out a day in my life. I have also always been very deliberate about warming up before a workout and cooling down and stretching after a workout.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;At some point during my training, I began to notice a persistent tightness in the lower front area of my left hip. It wasn't necessarily pain. The best way I can describe it is that it just sort of felt like there was a tight fist sitting on my hipbone? I assumed I just wasn't stretching my hip enough, or in the right way. I continued working out as normal, but just incorporated more and different hip stretches, and started trying to hold them for longer. When this didn't help, I thought that maybe I had just knocked something a little out of alignment by doing a squat or a lunge incorrectly. These were common in my guided interval workouts, and they tended to be quick in a way that sometimes made it difficult to maintain proper form. There had been times in the past where I had felt like doing a move incorrectly had knocked me out of alignment a little bit, but usually if I just re-did the moves more slowly and carefully, things just seemed to shift back into place. When this didn't help, I tried just cutting out the interval workouts, focusing instead on running, dancing, and yoga. By this point, the tightness had increased to pain, and cutting out the squats and lunges didn't help.\u00a0   \n&gt;  \n&gt;At this point, I finally accepted that something serious was wrong. I had about three weeks left until the 10K, so I stopped exercising completely in the hopes that rest would be the answer, and this did decrease my pain enough that by the time the 10K started, I felt I would be okay to run it as long as I went slow. (Also, it was Disney, and the trip had already been paid for by my very generous mother-in-law, and I had trained for months, and quite frankly I just really wanted to do it. I recognize now how stupid this was.) As I was running, the pain flared up again.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;When I got home from Disney, I took a month off of exercising, in the hopes that I just hadn't rested it enough the first time. The pain decreased with rest but never fully disappeared, and flared back up when I attempted to work out after a month of rest. At this point I spoke with my PCP, and he prescribed me Ibuprofen 600 mg and physical therapy. The medication did not help. The first physical therapist I saw diagnosed the pain as being due to alignment issues in my spine and pelvis, and gave me various exercises to fix this, but the exercises were all excessively complicated and difficult. They didn't help, and I stopped going after two months.\u00a0   \n&gt;  \n&gt;At this point, I went to an orthopedist who referred me to get at MRI. He also prescribed me an NSAID (diclofenac sodium, which I took for two months and it did not help.) I got the MRI, and the MRI report from the technologist stated that the image showed bursitis. However, when I followed up with my orthopedist, he was dismissive of this and said it was just a minor tear. He referred me back to physical therapy (at a different practice), and recommended I try dry needling. (I did try this, but the physical therapist could only ever get two needles in before I became excessively dizzy and nauseated and needed to stop. Medication to try and calm me down did not help.) This round of physical therapy was more successful, but didn't heal me completely. This physical therapist also diagnosed the problem as issues with alignment, though she acknowledged that a tear may be present as well. She gave me fewer and simpler exercises predominantly focused on strengthening my core and glutes. She also spent a lot of time doing manual therapy and deep tissue work. It took probably about six months, but I did gradually begin to feel I was recovering. Unfortunately, my boyfriend got a job offer here in Maryland, and we had to move away from where we were living at the time, causing me to have to leave this therapist. She told me I was mostly healed and could try to gradually start easing into running again.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;I tried this, and it actually went pretty okay for the first two, maybe three weeks. Then the pain returned. I found an orthopedist up here who told me that to him, my problem sounded like a simple overuse injury, and to just give it some time and resume physical therapy. I found a physical therapist up here, and he also focused on strengthening and manual therapy, but unfortunately, due to the nature of the practice where he worked, he wasn't really able to spend much time with me during my appointments. I worked with him for maybe two months? But did not feel I was improving, so I met with my orthopedist again, and he basically said he was stumped and couldn't help me, and sent me to a different orthopedist to see if the issue might be rooted in my spine. I was also referred to get another MRI of my spine, which did show some minor disc wear that was ruled to be unrelated to my hip pain. Because the issue was not spinal, this second orthopedist couldn't really help me either, but he recommended that I gradually try phasing exercise back in. I started walking on the treadmill, but my hip pain continued to persist, and at this point I started to experience some knee pain as well.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Around this time, I also turned 26, and lost coverage under my parents' health insurance. I have access to insurance through my job, but it took about two months to enroll and get my cards and everything, so during this time, I took a break from physical therapy and from walking on the treadmill. The absolute absence of any kind of physical activity did cause the pain to subside somewhat, but it never fully went away (to be a little more specific, I have had pain free periods in this time, but never for greater than a day), and being active always causes it to flare back up. Once my insurance was squared away, I re-enrolled in PT with the same therapist for about a month. Last month we had our re-evaluation, where he told me that I haven't made any progress in the past month and he can't help me anymore.\u00a0   \n&gt;  \n&gt;Something that most likely isn't relevant at all, but you never know, is that I was diagnosed with hydronephrosis of the right kidney and \"mild prominence of the left renal pelvis\" following my spinal MRI in January 2019. My first urologist I met with ordered a CT scan, and referred me to a second urologist for my over-active bladder (OAB) issue. He then called me to say that he did notice the previously mentioned hydronephrosis but he did not think it was anything to be concerned about. Additionally, the CT scan indicated a cyst in my right ovary, but the urologist I was referred to for OAB did not think it had anything to do with my hip pain. I am still with the second urologist treating my OAB.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;I just got back from a followup for an MRI with contrast on my left hip (technical phrasing: \"Following the arthrogram injection procedure, multiplanar MRI of the left hip was performed including T1-weighted and T2-weighted sequences. \"), and the technologist did not see anything remarkable.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The pain has always been centralized to the lower front part of my left hip, kind of right where the hipbone is, but sometimes while I was running it would travel down my leg. Sometimes I do feel the pain on the side of the hip, a little higher up, as well. Some tingling/numbness has occurred during the times when I attempted running/working out, but as long as I don't attempt physical activity it's more of just a consistent pain. It's not a dull throb, but it's not exactly sharp either? Sort of in-between. On a scale\u00a0from 1-10, at worst it's probably been a 7, but that was always during my attempts at exercise. In the past six months, the highest it's been has maybe been a 5? And there have been times where it's been at a 0, especially since I've cut out basically all physical activity save walking my dog. Sometimes sitting or lying in certain positions can also cause it to act up, and that usually puts it anywhere from a 3 to a 5, and that pain tends to be more on the sharp end of the spectrum."

Constant. It started out as being diagnosed as hemorrhoids. I initially used topical creams to try to rid them, which only provided temporary relied. I then went to a specialist who performed laser therapy inside my rectum to try to shrink some internal hemorrhoids I may have had causing the itching and irritation. I went through 3 laser treatments and still the itching persisted. This doctor then sent me to an anorectal specialist who did an exam and told me that I had a condition called Pruritus Ani and that it\u2019s chronic and I\u2019d have to watch my diet and soaps I use and types of underwear I wear..etc. This was in early 2013- since then I have stayed away from washing the area with soap. Tried different creams such as Pranicura and calmoseptine. Stopped using textured toilet paper. It goes on and off and has basically been a 7-8 year period of suffering, itching, bleeding after bowel movements due to irritated anal tissue, painful bowel movements. \n\nAround 2014, I stared having similar itching issues on the tissue around my clitoral hood and Vulva as well as the skin between my buttocks. It resulted in redness, itching, peeling, flaking, and bleeding due to irritation. I have been to several gynecologist\u2019s regarding the vulval itching and every time have been diagnosed with yeast infections and given nitrate creams and diflucan to clear it up. It seems to work but again only temporarily. I also went to my primary care doctor about the irritated skin between my buttocks and was given an anti fungal cream, which again worked but only temporarily. All of these issues have continually come back on and off since they started and have lead me to have more anxiety and depression due to being very frustrated-trying so many things and nothing working, and being overall extremely uncomfortable for years on end. \n\nI just went for my annual exam with my gyno 2 Friday\u2019s ago. She took a swab of some discharge and looked at it under a scope and diagnosed me with yet again another yeast infection. I told her about the vulvar itching/irritation and extreme uncomfortableness of it. She prescribed me 2 doses of diflucan to take over a week period and monistat 7 day to clear it up. Last Friday, I took my final dose of diflucan and finished my 7th day of monistat and have continued to apply the nitrate cream to the external irritated vulva areas as recommended by the gynecologist. The internal itching has stopped but external itching, redness, and irritation has continued and actually re-manifested on the opposite side of where it was originally was bothering me. I haven\u2019t had the irritation in this area in about a year until now. \n\nAround the time I was 12, I developed a circular shaped rash on the back of my neck that scaled and itched. I had it biopsied by a dermatologist who told me it was psoriasis. Since then I have had several areas of skin irritation, flaking, itching including my entire scalp, inner ears, and random patches here and there. I have gone back to several dermatologists who have told that they don\u2019t think these areas are Psoriasis but rather a mixture  seborrheic dermatitis  and eczema. I honestly don\u2019t know what to believe but this has been another extremely frustrating and what seems to be chronic issue that I can\u2019t get a solid diagnosis on. \n\nI\u2019m starting to wonder, could one of these skin conditions been what\u2019s causing the nonstop irritation and itching on my genitals? I tried to ask my gyno this question when I was at my appointment and she said most likely not and that after all her years of being in the field she\u2019s ever seen these conditions come about in the genital areas. I emailed her yesterday in concern of the issue not being resolved and she told me to try monistat 7 day again in a weeks time and if it does not clear up by then, to come back in and have the area biopsied. Again I\u2019m left totally frustrated and uncomfortable. I\u2019m newly married and needless to say this has pretty much ruined my sex life and libido on and off for years but especially now. \n\nAt this point, I\u2019m desperate for some help. I\u2019m tired of going through uncomfortable treatments and procedures, having to go to multiple doctors for uncomfortable and awkward appointments, being told the same things over and over again, trying treatment after treatment and getting my hopes up to no avail. Any ideas or thoughts from a doctor would be greatly appreciated. If any other details are needed that I left out, please let me know. Please help.\n\nI also want to point out that I have had multiple STD tests over the last 3 years, most currently last week for chlamydia, HIV, syphilis, gonorrhea, hep B + C, trichomoniasis, HPV... ALL came back negative so that is ruled out."

Geographical location: right tonsil. pain and redness with a white spot occurring yesterday and increasing in size. I was recently (2 weeks ago) on antibiotics (amoxicillin) for strep throat. I did not finish the script because it gave me a yeast infection (I know you\u2019re not suppose to do this, clearly it was a mistake and I\u2019ll never do it again). I do not smoke/ drink/ use recreational drugs. I take welbutrin to manage my anxiety and birth control (oral; junel) to manage endometriosis as well as prevent pregnancy. \n\nBasically two weeks ago my throat hurt pretty bad. I went to an urgent care and had a strep test done which came back positive. They put me on a 10 day amoxicillin treatment plan but I only took 4 days (8 pills) because I got a yeast infection and thought I was in the clear with my throat. I felt completely fine for about a week, yeast infection cleared up. Then my throat and ear started hurting. All on the right side. I figured it was just allergies as my boyfriend had itchy eyes and developed a cough which is typically how he gets allergies, whereas I get a runny/sneezy nose and itch ears and a sore throat. He\u2019s been exposed to me consistently since my first positive strep test but has not had any issues with his throat. This morning I woke up and threw up. After I felt fine. I went into work then came home and went to bed. Aside from my right tonsil having a white spot and my ear hurting my nose is a little runny and I experience some post nasal drip while asleep. I have been sneezing a bit more lately as well. Basically, I\u2019m pretty sure this is a result of me not finishing my antibiotics and is my strep throat coming back however as previously mentioned I have bad anxiety so part of me is also telling me this is throat cancer. Please do not laugh at me I am 100% serious... since May I\u2019ve dropped from 122lbs to 113lbs without trying. That\u2019s the only reason I have this other little part of my brain telling me this is worst case scenario. If this is strep, should I even bother going to get more antibiotics?

I am an otherwise healthy, active woman that has been significantly overweight since I was a toddler. I was born about 6 weeks premature, about 5 lbs at birth. I was normal sized until sometime around age 3 or 4, right around when my longterm memory comes online (I was already a fat kid by the time I have any real memories). I have been this way ever since, despite good diet and exercise. I do naturally have A SERIOUS AMOUNT of muscle mass and gain muscle extremely easily. My natural build is along the lines of  the larger female olympic weightlifters. My fat deposits are largely evenly distributed throughout my body and seem sorta well integrated with my muscle mass. Despite always being a fat woman I have relatively small breasts for my frame, unlike most larger women, with abnormally broad shoulders. (no other signs of hormones doing any off secondary sex stuff, no excess body hair, nada). Parents through great grandparents (as far back as I have info) were all about average sized. Mostly Italian and some German ancestry. \n\n  \nUntil recent injury from my job over the past year which I currently recovering from, I was an extremely active, and by all other quantifiable accounts, healthy woman for my entire life.  All my major vital signs and most blood tests have always been well  within normal...heartrate, blood pressure, even sometimes read into the \"athlete\" range.  Until aforementioned foot injury put me out of work, my career (construction industry adjacent) involved very long hours of serious physical work. Nonstop movement, walking, heavy lifting, ladder climbing, usually around 60 hours a week, often in hot conditions.  During some of the most intense periods of work, my weight would get down to about 225 at best from 265 (left alone I would hover between 250-265).  That was my largest loss ever (including in comparison to years of struggling with anorexia as a teen), and I describe my work as like doing crossfit a little slower but for 60-70 hours weekly, in 90+ degree humid conditions, probably consuming 2000-2500 calories a day, for 3 months straight.  When not working, my intake is about 1000-1800 at best; I don't actually eat very much if I'm not moving a lot. My meds decrease my appetite to almost nothing sometimes.  \n\n\nAs mentioned, I struggled with anorexia on and off from the ages of around 14 to around 17. I showed signs of malnutrition like hair loss, paper thin nails, sunken eyes, etc; but I didn't actually lose all that much weight. As a small child I grew up in an \\*extremely poor\\* family (like sometimes we didn't have electricity level poor), and while we always had at least a little food in the house, it was always the cheapest and usually nutritionally garbage option. Largely carbs like pasta and bread, fats, sweets. My mother was kind of a shitshow human and I barely have memories of getting water as a child; I do remember her doing things like putting Hawaiian Punch and Pepsi into my toddler siblings' bottles, and being fed untold amounts of sugary drinks and shitty processed food and pastries as a toddler, then ridiculed and abused by her for my weight (as if I had any control of my surroundings at 5 years old?).  She got a little better about food as I got older, and as a teen I started to have more freedom to eat properly, and that only improved more and more with freedom and age.  I'm quite knowledgeable about nutrition by this point in my life. From the time I was about 16 I have experimented with various kinds of vegetarianism, raw veganism, \"paleo\" style eating, juicing, keto, low carb...you get the idea.    \n\n\nExtreme ketosis seems to be the only other thing besides either abject starvation or unsustainable full time+ job levels of exercise that has \\*any\\* affect on my weight, and none of those things are sustainable. Countless doctors have looked into this and come up with nothing for me. The most anyone could give me was info on a study called the Dutch Papers, where my great grandparents' generation in Europe was studied to see how World War II rationing affected the body over time and generations. My great grandparents did go through rationing in WWII, so apparently I qualify to be affected by the genetic problems caused by that long term malnutrition by my body having a tendency to angrily hang on to ever single thing consumed.  Combine that with the absymal food I was fed when I was still developing, and the assumption is well, this is just how you are. Which like, I can accept, but society sure can't. And seeing a new doctor is always a nightmare of trying to wade through their fatphobia and attributing anything from a common cold to a concussion to my weight, and either don't take me seriously, don't believe me, and or refuse treatment.   \n\n\nI don't have any reproductive/hormonal issues like PCOS.  My thyroid levels have shown slightly low in the past, but within the last 3 years was the first time I could even convince a doctor to test my thyroid, so I don't have an accurate reading on what \"my normal\" is. They threw some levothyroxine at me and continued upping it over 6 months without checking my levels. I felt like shit and my hair started falling out, but I sure didn't lose any weight. Then my levels showed too high. I stopped taking it and felt normal again. My normal also has a lot of brain fog and fatigue, but that's also symptomatic of my depression (but then, depression is symptomatic of hypothyroidism).   \n\n\nAfter my entire lifetime thus far of this, I've mostly just accepted I'm just gonna always be one of those big strong-like-ox type women, and I LOVE being strong. But it's also just become such a frustrating puzzle that no one seems to have any insight on. I would love any professional thoughts (but please keep your judgements, I've been completely truthful about my history and habits here, have no reason to lie)."

        "reddit": "I'm sorry this is long, I'm just trying to give you all relevant info.\n\nTL;DR (but hopefully you read!): itchy/burning/painful vagina (but no STI/BV/prolapse) + facial numbing: are these effects of the same cause? If so, any ideas what (ie nerve damage)? If not, any ideas of independent causes (ie Vulvodynia, stoke)?\n\nFor three years, off and on, my vulva has been itchy right at the hole/entry. At first, I assumed it was a yeast infection and treated OTC but it kept coming back quickly. Compared to previous yeast infections, the itch is more mild and it's unusual it's localized to just the vestibule. Over the three years, the symptoms have developed to include occasional burning, a painful tearing feeling, pins/needles at the perineum, and it sometimes feels like I'm sitting on a golf ball. Over the three years, doctors have tested for STIs, BV, and the likes. The tests always come back normal/negative and I've just left it at that, but the symptoms returned a month ago and I'm committed to pursuing a diagnosis further. \n\nI recently went to the doctor to get the ball rolling on a diagnosis again. Doctor wanted to test again for STIs and the likes. This time, the speculum was very uncomfortable. It felt it was in very deep despite barely being in. She was able to swab; tests came back negative. She said despite my age and not having children, it could be a prolapse. I went for a (regular?) ultrasound and transvaginal ultrasound. The transvaginal was painful and I asked to stop. Results of regular ultrasound came back normal. Doctor said it could be Vagimisus despite no traumatic history. From looking online, I think my symptoms are consistent with Vulvodynia. \n\n(I should add while on this topic: I was sexually active, regularly, ages 15-19, with a few partners, always tested negative for STIs. Have been abstinent ages 20-26 (present) but had two encounters of genital touching with two partners, one who complained he was itchy the next day (but I felt fine.))\n\n**Here's where things get weird:** My lips, tip of nose, tip of tongue, and roof of mouth went tingly/numb on Tuesday evening and it continued into Wednesday morning but the went away. I happened to have a doc appointment (for ultrasound results) Wednesday, so I brought it up. Doc said a one-time occurrence isn't concerning; bring it back up if it becomes recurrent. \n\nYesterday (Sunday), the left side of my face had strong tingly sensation then numbness. It came on suddenly. After about 20 mins, I felt light headed, had blurred vision, and the back of my neck felt badly strained. I checked for facial drooping but I was fine. I called a gov't-funded health care hotline to ask if I should go to the hospital and they decided to send an ambulance. By the time they arrived, my face had regained most feeling. Paramedics checked me in the ambulance and noticed high blood pressure. They said I either experienced a TIA (mini stroke) or anxiety attack, but I'm wondering if it is nerve damage. I decided not to go to the hospital. Everything eased up, though the centre of my lips went numb later that night. \n\nWhen I was 19, I had a spine injury (herniated L4/L5, pinched nerve, sciatica). It was pretty bad (eg needed assistance putting my pants on). My hands/feet would periodically tingle off/on for a few years, but everything eventually eased up. \n\nOn Tuesday, prior to centre-facial numbing, I had moved/loaded all of my belonging into a moving truck by myself. On Saturday (day before left-facial numbing), I dragged a *very* large and heavy house plant to a new spot in the home (and my back has been sore since). It's interesting that facial numbing has occurred shortly after onerous physical activity.\n\nI'm beginning to wonder if the symptoms in the vulva and the facial numbing are actually connected and am seeking an opinion on that. If you don't think they are, I'm still interested in your opinion on possible causes/diagnosis of the two matters, separately. I'm between apartments/cities right now so I'm holding off on seeing a doctor again (unless an emergency) until I arrive to my new home/city in late August.\n\nThank you so much for taking the time to read and respond.\n\n* Age: 26\n* Sex: F\n* Height: 5'7\"\n* Weight: 220 lbs\n* Race: White\n* Duration of complaint: 3 years off/on (vulva); 2x in 1 week (facial numbing)\n* Location (Geographic and on body): Canada .... vulva &amp; face\n* Any existing relevant medical issues (if any): No\n* Current medications (if any): Depo-Provera (BC shot) for past 6 years (and as a result haven't menstruated for past 5 years)"

I assumed I just slept on it wrong. It feels deep in my neck and back of my head, not an area I can massage to make it feel better.\n\nTwice in the past two days, I randomly got hit with the sense that I can't see anymore. To try and explain it, it's like a spot of blurryness and lights near the middle of my eye, making it hard to focus on anything. It basically blurs out anything I try to focus on, but I can still (barely) see everything around the spot. Right now it just hit me while I was sitting in a massage chair for my neck, and my neck pain got even worse once it started. I don't think I've ever had a migraine but my mom has a history of them. The pain feels like a bad cramp deep inside my neck, back of head, and even along my jaw.\n\nThe vision thing will last for maybe 5-10 minutes. It's really bad at first because the spot starts out small, but then it gets bigger and it gets easier to see the more it expands.\n\nEDIT: The neck pain moved to the back of my head and is now behind my eyes as well as my neck and head. I feel nauseous, weak, sensitive to light. I asked my mom if it could be a migraine or something more serious and she didn't seem too concerned, just told me to take painkillers and put a hot washcloth on my head. It helped but the pain is the worst headache I've ever had. It feels like a brain freeze that won't end. I don't know if I can go to a doctor right now, especially since my mom isn't very concerned."

        "reddit": "Some demographics: I am a 22 year old white female. I am 5\u20196\u201d and 115 pounds. I only take birth control (Tri Sprintec which I have been taking for 6 years) and am a non smoker. I have asthma, allergies, and anxiety but that\u2019s about it on medical conditions. \n\nMy chief complaint is major fatigue. 2 years ago I started noticing that on my summer break, I was sleeping much longer than usual. 12 hours every single night and still feeling sluggish and tired during the day. At that point my job was later in the day and only part time so it took a while to notice. However, after figuring that it was definitely out of the norm, I visited my PCP. She ordered a bunch of lab worn and referred me to rheumatology due to a positive ANA. I went to two different rheumatologists with nothing. Then I went to hematology and got a CT scan. Still nothing. I went to a sleep specialist and he thought I had narcolepsy despite me not having some of the classic symptoms. Regardless, he wanted me to do a sleep study which turned up with nothing still. He said I went into REM quickly but I didn\u2019t meet he criteria. I had a feeling because the only thing that can keep me awake is anxiety and I was having a lot of that during my study. I felt hopeless for a long time and tried a naturopathic doctor who ordered even more stuff with the only thing showing up being iron deficiency WITHOUT anemia. I took iron pills maybe 15 times over 4 months and got levels drawn again. Expecting my levels to be near what they were, they were sky high. It didnt make sense to me because I barely took the pills due to my own forgetfulness. Nonetheless, it was weird. Turns out I have a mutation for hemacromatosis. That doesn\u2019t explain the fatigue though. I gave up for a while but went in to see another sleep specialist. She thought I had narcolepsy based on what I told her but I am still unconvinced due to me not having classic symptoms. I\u2019m scheduled for another sleep study but not for a while. In the mean time, I\u2019m sleeping 10-14 hours every night and still feeling fatigued during the day. I fight against naps because those end up being hours long and achieve nothing. I can\u2019t even remember what it\u2019s like to have energy anymore. I\u2019m constantly exhausted and irritable due to the tiredness. I don\u2019t know what else to do at this point. I hate to take the idiopathic hypersomnia diagnosis because I feel that that is just an excuse for not knowing what\u2019s wrong. I\u2019ve had thyroid panels, hormone levels, vitamins, CBCs, diabetes screens, HIV, Hepatitis, you name it, I\u2019ve had it drawn. Does anyone have any ideas? If you are so inclined to say idiopathic hypersomnia or narcolepsy, describe why as I feel these are not correct."

My current meds are trintellix 20mg 1x/day, junel birthcontrol 1x/day, minocycline 100mg 2x/day, vit d 5,000mg 1x/day, and a probiotic. \n\nFor the past 5 years I\u2019ve been living in a state of constant exhaustion. I literally cannot remember the last time I didn\u2019t feel tired, and sometimes it gets so bad I feel like I can\u2019t breathe and I can\u2019t see straight. I feel so alone because I sleep too much to be able to maintain social relationships and when I\u2019ve slept so much my body won\u2019t allow me to sleep anymore, I end up awake while everyone else is asleep. I\u2019ve gained a ton of weight due to having no energy to exercise or to cook healthy meals. I\u2019ve fallen asleep at work multiple times and live in fear everyday I go in that someone will see and I\u2019ll get fired. I had to drop out of college because I couldn\u2019t get through class or have enough energy to do work. I had to move back in with my parents because I\u2019m too exhausted to take care of myself. \n\nI know most peoples first suggestion when they hear this is depression. However, I\u2019ve experienced bouts of depression but had this issue both before and after it. The exhaustion also feels very physical, as if my body can\u2019t handle functioning anymore. \n\nMedical History; \n\nMy first dx that might be relevant is hashimotos disease. I\u2019ve read online that it can cause tiredness but I\u2019ve never heard of anything this severe. Also, if it is the cause I\u2019m not sure what to do. My Dr said they won\u2019t give me any meds for it until my thyroid horomones are abnormal as well, not just my antibodies. They also didn\u2019t seem to think this was related. \n\nMy second dx was dysautonomia. When I did my research on this, it kinda seemed like they were giving me a name bc they didn\u2019t know what else to say. Typically you\u2019re diagnosed with a type of dysautonomia, and I was not. They gave me various corticosteroids which did nothing. They also had me try a liquid b12, which did nothing. \n\nMy final dx was chronic lyme disease. I don\u2019t know if I believe in this but supposedly my blood test came back positive. This Dr says that\u2019s what\u2019s making me so tired and prescribed me the minocycline which I am currently taking. Interestingly, I became severely depressed and unstable about a year ago, but since I started  taking the antibiotic about a month ago those psychological symptoms suddenly disappeared. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a placebo because I expected the drug to do absolutely nothing. However, the exhaustion remains. Perhaps it just takes longer to go away. But everything I read says chronic lyme isn\u2019t real, so if that\u2019s the case I\u2019m not sure what my next step should be from here. \n\nIf anyone can provide any insight, that would be fantastic. Suggestions for ways to cope would be helpful as well. Thanks!"

Every time I go to the doctor I get it checked out, I have had over 8 different physicians in this time and none of them could tell me what it is. I was sent to 2 dermatologists over those years (I can't afford to go again) and at first they had thought it was a form of cancer, but after a biopsy and blood tests, nothing showed up abnormal.

When those didn't work they gave me antibiotics for any bacterial or fungal infections, but of course those didn't work. The doctors then gave up and said if it's not giving me pain or getting worse than I may have to live with it.

The only medication I take is 10mg Adderall XR a day usually 5 days a week. \n\nEarlier today, maybe 4 o'clock, I was folding sheets and putting them away in the linen closet. My right side suddenly went wonky....it wasn't numb exactly, no pins and needles, no pain. Just suddenly it felt like my right leg and arm were...rubber? Wax-like? Jello?...more like they disappeared?.... It almost felt like I was melting. At the same time I felt like I was falling over to that side, but I wasn't really falling...I don't think. I raised my arm and put my palm against the door, it was only half open, so it didn't brace me, it gave. I kind of stumbled, more out of surprise than anything, but didn't fall. My knee didn't buckle, but it kind of felt like my leg wasn't there, same with my arm, although they seemed to be following instructions. I lifted my foot up and put it back down, turned around. During all of this I either felt like I was falling to that side or I was just scared that I was going to? I didn't feel nauseated really, but I did panic, so I had that feeling in my stomach.\n\nI was tired, I had been helping a friend move and lost some sleep 2 nights ago. I had not been moving heavy things, just packing boxes, labelling etc. I have never felt anything like that before. It only lasted maybe 1 or 2 minutes. I don't really know how to explain it, it just sort of felt like that side of my body did not exist or belong to me for a minute, even my face. Like... I could tell it to do things and it would do them but weirdly disconnected. And  the floor was tilting to that side, initially it was almost like that discombobulated sensation you feel when you're going down steps and you miss one and your foot lands on the next one down, after that it just felt like there was nothing under my foot, I could feel the floor it just wasn't in the right place.... No spinning, no dizziness, no fainting feeling.\n\nETA* not sure if relevant but this past Wednesday I had some kind of 24 hour flu-like virus.      \n\nI'm going to sleep now I hope someone can explain because not knowing what happened is freaking me out.

An example of was this spring when I felt a gripping tension in my right testicle when I woke up one morning, and by the afternoon I had developed a nasty case of tonsillitis. I felt the same testiclular pain last night, although midly, and I woke up this morning with a light fever.

Constant. It started out as being diagnosed as hemorrhoids. I initially used topical creams to try to rid them, which only provided temporary relied. I then went to a specialist who performed laser therapy inside my rectum to try to shrink some internal hemorrhoids I may have had causing the itching and irritation. I went through 3 laser treatments and still the itching persisted. This doctor then sent me to an anorectal specialist who did an exam and told me that I had a condition called Pruritus Ani and that it\u2019s chronic and I\u2019d have to watch my diet and soaps I use and types of underwear I wear..etc. This was in early 2013- since then I have stayed away from washing the area with soap. Tried different creams such as Pranicura and calmoseptine. Stopped using textured toilet paper. It goes on and off and has basically been a 7-8 year period of suffering, itching, bleeding after bowel movements due to irritated anal tissue, painful bowel movements. \n\nAround 2014, I stared having similar itching issues on the tissue around my clitoral hood and Vulva as well as the skin between my buttocks. It resulted in redness, itching, peeling, flaking, and bleeding due to irritation. I have been to several gynecologist\u2019s regarding the vulval itching and every time have been diagnosed with yeast infections and given nitrate creams and diflucan to clear it up. It seems to work but again only temporarily. I also went to my primary care doctor about the irritated skin between my buttocks and was given an anti fungal cream, which again worked but only temporarily. All of these issues have continually come back on and off since they started and have lead me to have more anxiety and depression due to being very frustrated-trying so many things and nothing working, and being overall extremely uncomfortable for years on end. \n\nI just went for my annual exam with my gyno 2 Friday\u2019s ago. She took a swab of some discharge and looked at it under a scope and diagnosed me with yet again another yeast infection. I told her about the vulvar itching/irritation and extreme uncomfortableness of it. She prescribed me 2 doses of diflucan to take over a week period and monistat 7 day to clear it up. Last Friday, I took my final dose of diflucan and finished my 7th day of monistat and have continued to apply the nitrate cream to the external irritated vulva areas as recommended by the gynecologist. The internal itching has stopped but external itching, redness, and irritation has continued and actually re-manifested on the opposite side of where it was originally was bothering me. I haven\u2019t had the irritation in this area in about a year until now. \n\nAround the time I was 12, I developed a circular shaped rash on the back of my neck that scaled and itched. I had it biopsied by a dermatologist who told me it was psoriasis. Since then I have had several areas of skin irritation, flaking, itching including my entire scalp, inner ears, and random patches here and there. I have gone back to several dermatologists who have told that they don\u2019t think these areas are Psoriasis but rather a mixture  seborrheic dermatitis  and eczema. I honestly don\u2019t know what to believe but this has been another extremely frustrating and what seems to be chronic issue that I can\u2019t get a solid diagnosis on. \n\nI\u2019m starting to wonder, could one of these skin conditions been what\u2019s causing the nonstop irritation and itching on my genitals? I tried to ask my gyno this question when I was at my appointment and she said most likely not and that after all her years of being in the field she\u2019s ever seen these conditions come about in the genital areas. I emailed her yesterday in concern of the issue not being resolved and she told me to try monistat 7 day again in a weeks time and if it does not clear up by then, to come back in and have the area biopsied. Again I\u2019m left totally frustrated and uncomfortable. I\u2019m newly married and needless to say this has pretty much ruined my sex life and libido on and off for years but especially now. \n\nAt this point, I\u2019m desperate for some help. I\u2019m tired of going through uncomfortable treatments and procedures, having to go to multiple doctors for uncomfortable and awkward appointments, being told the same things over and over again, trying treatment after treatment and getting my hopes up to no avail. Any ideas or thoughts from a doctor would be greatly appreciated. If any other details are needed that I left out, please let me know. Please help.\n\nI also want to point out that I have had multiple STD tests over the last 3 years, most currently last week for chlamydia, HIV, syphilis, gonorrhea, hep B + C, trichomoniasis, HPV... ALL came back negative so that is ruled out.\n\nI also have had my symptoms grow worse in the last 24 hours, which is weird considering I\u2019ve now take 2 doses of diflucan and a week of monistat. I don\u2019t know if I should go back to my gynecologist who told me to do another week of monistat, go to primary care, or maybe even dermatology?"

I went to the bathroom and came very close to throwing up, but instead I just sat with the trash can and breathed very heavily and rhythmically for a few minutes, kind of hyperventilating. \n\nSide note: I recently went on birth control and have pretty much concluded that the nausea was due to taking 2 pills in one day because I missed a day (and I didn\u2019t eat much yesterday so that didn\u2019t help). Also I have had a minor cold for the past few days and took some cold medicine for that.\n\nNormally when I vomit (it doesn\u2019t happen often, but I remember because I had the flu a few months ago) my arms and legs will get a tingly, pins and needles sensation or even go a little numb. But this time, I felt my entire arms not just tingling but almost vibrating, and then they went completely numb for a few minutes and got frozen in a really strange position. Both elbows were bent, wrists were bent, thumbs turned inward, and fingers either stuck out straight in a contorted position (left hand) or in a tight fist (right hand). It lasted a few minutes and really freaked me out - I was afraid of them cramping up so I tried to push my hands against my legs to put my hands in a relaxed position but it wouldn\u2019t work. After a few minutes of my arms being stuck that way, feeling came back into my shoulders and worked its way slowly down to my hands.\n\nI didn\u2019t end up vomiting, but I was really scared of my arms becoming paralyzed forever and I can\u2019t find any info online for why this might\u2019ve happened. I should also mention that my fingertips or entire hands sometimes go numb/tingly while laying on my back or if it\u2019s particularly cold, or sometimes for no apparent reason. Help!"

I was prescribed Post Exposure Prophylaxis to prevent HIV, which I started 66 hours after the potential exposure for a period of 28 days. I have done two rapid HIV tests, one in March and one in July (1 and 5 months after potential exposure), and both tests came out negative. But just 2 weeks after the 5th month test, I got very bad flu-like symptoms; experienced fever, headaches, swollen armpit lymph nodes and occasional breathlessness before I sleep at night. I learnt online that most of those are HIV seroconversion symptoms, though HIV does have similar symptoms to other diseases. Could HIV seroconversion have delayed till the 5th month after my 5th month test? \n\nIt's also important to add that I've had constipation I believe to be chronic now. It started off as painful stools around March without constipation. I thought it was a hemorrhage or side effects of the PEP I was on, so I ate more fruits, fiber, drank more water etc. and the pain stopped after a few days, but over the course of time, the consistency of my stools reduced and now I'm downright constipated and feel a general change in bowel habits. I learnt HPV can cause colorectal cancer which causes such symptoms. If I got infected with HPV, is it possible it could lead to colorectal cancer within 6 months of infection? \n\nMoreover, the whites of my eyes have been turning yellow recently (a bit light yellow now, but definitely not as white as before). I learnt Hepatitis B causes this. Is jaundice a clear indication of hepatitis? \n\nI will run tests, but at the moment please enlighten me on reasonable expectations of what could be wrong. How possible or likely are the diseases I'm suspecting (i.e. HIV with a 5 month delay in seroconversion, HPV-caused colorectal cancer within 6 months or/and Hepatitis B)? Or are there other STDs that could cause the exact symptoms I mentioned?"

Unemployed.\n\n**Other conditions**: Obesity / poor diet, elevated Blood Pressure (never diagnosed, but it's high every time it's checked), low Testosterone (have yet to start TRT), Anxiety and Depression.\n\n**Backstory**: Woke up one day (4/15) feeling terrible. I found myself with fatigue / spaciness, reduced appetite, incomplete bowel movements, my eyes feeling weird, a tight grinding pain in my lower left abdomen, and my left testicle acting a little odd. Along with some chills (which has seemingly turned into a general sensitivity to colder rooms) and a cough that turns into gagging for no reason.\n\nGave it a few days, but saw no improvement. Went to Urgent Care (4/19). The Dr. there suspected that it was a mixture of anxiety and IBS, and gave me a script for Hyoscyamine.\n\nThat seemed to reduce the abdominal pain, but the other symptoms remained. Saw my GP a few days later (4/25) and he seemed somewhat perplexed. Towards the end, I mentioned my testicle feeling a little odd, and although neither of us felt anything strange, he thought it may be the smoking gun, and sent me to get an Ultrasound.\n\nUltimately, my ball ended up being nothing to worry about. I got bloodwork around that time too (6/5), but nothing was flagged.\n\nNonetheless, I still feel bad, and some new symptoms have popped up too:\n\n\\- A firm, painless node (?) near my left ear (which showed up in June) has turned into what appears to be a cluster (2 or 3) of them, which now impairs my hearing, messes with my equilibrium and causes jaw discomfort. There's some vague tenderness in the area, even though they're still quite firm. I've got a dark red mark on each temple that arrived with the first node, too.\n\n\\- Occasional tightness in my chest, ribs, and abdomen when breathing deep; occasional pain in my lower and mid back, my tailbone area, and in a spot that's basically between the shoulder blade and armpit.\n\n\\- My neck feels tight most of the time and my throat seems enlarged (swollen?); There's a subtle red patch near the aforementioned nodes as well.\n\n\\- I've had a fever all day, which is concerning.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFace photo here: [https://i.imgur.com/NSB7apz.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/NSB7apz.jpg) (light blue arrows - nodes.

Dark blue - red mark.)\n\nand here: [https://i.imgur.com/pnUdN7M.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/pnUdN7M.jpg) (the black dots in this are from the material coating my headphones)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyway - I haven't felt like myself in months, and it saddens me. I'm also frustrated because all of these symptoms seem so ambiguous and weird. I tried to believe that it was anxiety, or \"all in my head\", but it's certainly not.\n\nI'm hoping to see my GP again next week. What should I push for? Info on the (suspected) lymph nodes? Some kind of scan? Advanced bloodwork? A referral to a specialist? All of the above?\n\nIn the meantime, do any conditions jump out at anyone? Google seems to think that Lymphoma is possible, but I also get that it's still a rarity, even if it does make a lot of sense.\n\nAny insight is appreciated. Thanks for your time."

It started with me waking up in the morning feeling a little breathless, almost like I had run up a flight of stairs.  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBy the 2nd morning I went to my doctor. He ran an ECG in his office, he seemed concerned. I did notice the words \"aterial fibrillation\" on the ECG print out.  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe recommended I go to hospital, they ran blood tests and took blood from the arteries on my wrists to measure my oxygen level? I assume.  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThey kept me over night and I also had a heart echo done, more ecgs, chest x ray.

I felt like I was shallow breathing due to the tightness making it feel? hard to breathe in.  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSometimes it'd get bad and for hours I'd be trying to keep myself calm . The difference between my normal breathing (easy) and trying to breathe when my chest feels tight it huge.  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWent to doctor, they seemed maybe worried it was asthma, sent me for a chest xray, it was clear I think, Doctor as the hospital ran some blood work.  \nThen he pressed around my chest until he found a very very tender area and diagnosed\u00a0Costochondritis.  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt took many months for the tight breathing / hard to breathe episodes\u00a0to leave but they finally did, then I caught another virus.chest/sinus infection and it came back with a vengeance\u00a0. With much more achy chest pain plus stabbing pains over the tender area on left side of my chest.   \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have noticed, that when my chest gets tight, I nearly always cough/hack up some mucus.\n\n(could be related to my sinus issues\u00a0though)  \n\n\nFrom reading online, finding it hard to breath does seem to be very common with people who have \u00a0Costochondritis     \n\n\nOften when the chest is tight my heart rate is faster than normal.\n\nI've also been having a tightness around upper chest and bottom of neck/throat. If I push lightly\u00a0 on the bottom front of neck the tube feels a little tender and I get a lump in throat sensation or like the muscles tighten up a little.  \n\n\nI also find I gag a little with the throat tightness and chest tightness.

I am not sure what to do anymore as far as finding answers. If anyone here could give me any advice, it would be much appreciated! Here is a general timeline. \n\nAround March 2018, my first symptoms began. I was exhausted and when I would go to the bathroom, I would notice blood. From the end of April-June 2018, I was too exhausted to train. My blood work showed my estrogen was very low, my FSH was very high and my AMH was very low. My uterine lining was extremely thick, so the dr suspected I potentially had uterine cancer. This was luckily not the case and my uterine lining went back to normal. My sport is a weight restricting sport, so I attributed this to potentially having too low of body fat.\n\nFast forward to this March 2019. Whenever I would try to train, I felt like I had the flu. I competed in April 2019 and got extremely sick after. My liver enzymes were at \u201ccritical\u201d levels and my hormones got worse. I felt like I couldn\u2019t leave bed. \n\nI attempted to make it back to the gym in May 2019 and passed out. Then, I collapsed again at home about a week later which lead me to the hospital.\n\nIn the hospital, I had CPK numbers high enough to be considered rhabdo (even though I hadn\u2019t been working out). I developed a \u201cbutterfly rash\u201d on my face, but I did not test positive for lupus. I also had \u201cslight\u201d carotid stenosis. \n\nFor the month of June 2019, I could barely leave bed. On the days when I felt worst, the rash would appear more prominently. I had a low grade fever almost every day. I felt tingling in my extremities. Some days I felt too weak to even walk. My glands were huge. I had mouth ulcers. I felt dizzy and \u201cspacey.\u201d I would have unbelievable joint pain. I was so itchy at night. I literally felt like a prisoner in my own body.\n\nSince then, I have been to a rheumatologist, who said it isn\u2019t autoimmune. I have been to an infectious disease dr who thinks it is not an infectious disease, but thinks it could be autoimmune. My hormones went back to normal in July (first time in over a year) and my gynecologist thinks it was autoimmune. At one point I thought it was from weight restriction, so I gained weight and body fat and have been heavier for a while and that hasn\u2019t helped.\n\nJuly 2019 I felt better. And I was so happy to finally feel better. However, by the end of the month, I was sick again. Now I\u2019m going on about 2 weeks of feeling like I can barely move again. \n\nI still have an EEG test to take with a neurologist. My brain MRI came back ok and my back MRI I have to go in and discuss. This will be by the end of the month. \n\nMy regular doctor just gives me B12 shots. And claims it\u2019s Epstein Barr being reactivated. My Epstein Barr has shown that it is \u201cactive\u201d for over a year now every time I get blood work. I have also read that some doctors don\u2019t even believe in this. Regardless, I feel like I can\u2019t live my life this way. I\u2019m so frustrated. I\u2019m an athlete with so many hopes and dreams that I feel like are being shattered. Beyond that though, I want to feel good enough to enjoy my life at least. I have had to cancel so many plans because of my health and I have no real diagnoses. It is extremely frustrating. I just would like any advice on what I could do. I just want to feel like I can live a normal life again!"

        "reddit": "Age: 27\n\nSex: Male\n\nHeight: 6 Feet 0 Inches\n\nWeight: 165 lbs\n\nRace: Caucasian\n\nDuration of complaint: About 3 months\n\nLocation: Colon, stomach\n\nAny existing relevant medical issues: N/A\n\nCurrent medications: N/A\n\n\n\n-----\n\n\n\nShort version; For the last 3 months, I've been having rancid gas attacks that last anywhere between 2 hours to a whole day, bloating, recently sometimes a small amount of visible mucus in stool, and change in bowel movement consistency. However I get periods of time where I have no symptoms at all. Anywhere from a day, to up to a full week. Would something serious allow for these \"breaks\" in symptoms? Or does this just sound like IBS?\n\nLong version; Hi all. I'm going to try to lay out the timeline for this. About three months ago around the end of April / beginning of May, I found that at random times, I would get these attacks of just rancid gas, passing it every 2-5 minutes. Sometimes the smell got so bad, if I was on a plane they'd probably ground it and kick me off. That bad. At first it wasn't very often, and I thought it was the protein powder that I had been drinking since 'protein farts' were a thing.\n\nHowever, coming into late May, early June, they started getting a little more consistent. Maybe once every 3-5 days. I started to think I developed lactose intolerance, so I cut it out of my diet. However after a full week, it was still happening. Next, I tried cutting all the caffeine out of my system. I usually have 1-2 cups of home brewed black coffee every day, occasionally swapping out for tea.\n\nThis also didn't help. Now by mid June, I started getting bloated whenever I would have these attacks. Never any pain, just feeling.... bleh. By mid July, I noticed a little bit of yellow-ish / clear mucus in my stool. It wasn't much, and it only happened that week and I haven't seen it since.\n\nConstantly through the summer my consistency of stool has changed a lot. A lot of times it's always easy to pass, but it's been a little messy. Somewhere between a 4 and 6 on the Bristol chart. Gas attacks still happen at random, and it's always rancid. I am still getting breaks with not having any symptoms for days, up to a whole week in July, symptom-free. Gas, stool, everything, normal.\n\nAt this point there's still never any real pain, and more importantly, never any blood, except for one time back in April or May that was very bright and only on the TP. I've also been a consistent weight. I've always been underweight around 150 since college, so being at 165-ish is great for me.\n\nSo, **I guess my overall question** is if this was a serious condition such as colon cancer, Crohn's, etc... would I ever have these breaks in symptoms? I've always had the thought in the back of my mind that this is just IBS, linked to my light work stress / overall small amount of anxiety, but I'm in the process of moving insurance and won't get to a doctor for a bit so wanted to just hear some thoughts from people who knew better than I did. **I am** going to a doctor in the future regardless, but my fiance is getting very worried about it and, well so am I now honestly."

Located on the hip where my clothes would rub against. It felt like Sunday and Monday were pretty swollen and painful but Monday It did develop a white head. I then felt something wet and I saw the pus had leaked so I went in and squeezed some of it out, but it was quite painful so I just got as much as I can. \n\nToday the swelling is down however I saw an even bigger white head and popped that. And a lot of blood came out. I did get all the pus even the hard part of it and a lot of blood was coming out so I squeezed that out as well. \n\nSo now even though I drained it, I cleaned it, put peroxide and stuff and trying to air it out but it\u2019s difficult with it\u2019s location. \n\nWhat is concerning me is the fact there\u2019s a pretty big hole, not sure if that\u2019s something I should go see a doctor about. There\u2019s no pain or throbbing in the area and it is smaller than it was yesterday. But the hold area does sting however. \n\nSo should I wait it out, or should I go seek some help just in case?"

What I\u2019m really trying to understand is if I\u2019m going through alcohol withdrawal and need to seek a medical detox or if this is a case of really bad hangover drawn out from being run down and partying a little too hard over summer\n\nThis all began 2 weeks ago (July 22) coming out of probably the biggest bender/binge of my lift. I spent 5 days (Wed-Sun) drinking heavily at night. Probably somewhere around 10-15 each night with Saturday into Sunday drinking the entire night, no sleep and then drinking all day Sunday. Each day I was quite hungover but battled through it until around 5 or 6 when I\u2019d start sipping beer again and then end up getting very drunk and minimal sleep. This wasn\u2019t just a decision to drink a lot, I was kind of obligated to drink with a mix of work parties and friends in town with pre-planned activities. If I didn\u2019t *have* to I would have probably taken some days off to relax.\n\nCome Monday I was hit with one of the worst hangover I\u2019ve ever had, which I expected. But this hangover was different, I wasn\u2019t vomiting but felt very nauseous, and achy all over. 24 hours later (Monday night) I had some of the worst anxiety ever and could barely sleep. When I\u2019d sleep for an hour I\u2019d wake up in full panic delirious and sweating. The sweats and overall uneasiness and anxiety continued for the next 3-4 days and I honestly don\u2019t feel great still. That Monday night my head/brain felt so much like mush like I was going to pass out or brain was about to seize my anxious mind looked up alcohol withdrawal and I brought myself to the ER to get checked out in case I was withdrawing. I was so scared of having a seizure or serious DT\u2019s. The ER took my blood pressure, heart rate, and everything was fine. Loaded me up with fluids and sent me on my way.\n\nI scheduled an appointment with my GP and told him how I still haven\u2019t been feeling great after a bender and was incredibly anxious all the time and he said you were probably withdrawing after a bender but it would get better over time. I put my body through a lot over those 5 days.\n\nFastfoward to this past weekend I felt a bit better and drank Thursday, Friday, and Saturday moderately but was hit again with awful anxiety and general nausea the past three days. I\u2019m very worried that I\u2019ve kindled my brain and scared that if I ever drink heavily again I\u2019ll have a seizure or serious withdrawals.\n\nI just turned 26 and have drank a lot since college, but nothing out of the norm of what my peers do (espeically living the city i'm in). Essentially a weekend warrior type that drinks heavily on weekends and then has no problem staying off booze during the workweek (maybe a few drinks here or there). I\u2019ve done this the past 2 years and battled the classic Sunday scaries but never had withdrawals lasting days at a time. I will say I can drink a lot, anywhere from 10-15 beers on a night (weekends). \n\nDid I do myself in with this bender and somehow rewire or kindle my brain drinking heavily 5 days in a row? I want to be able to drink socially without having the fear of going through terrible withdrawals. I never wake up thinking I need a drink and quite honestly hangover keep me away from drinking unless I\u2019m forced into a social drinking setting. Hoping this was just a serious tax on my body from 5 days of drinking in a row and probably more drinking than I should have over summer. \n\nCurious to know if I\u2019m in withdrawal territory or just need to start moderating on weekends so it doesn\u2019t tax my body terribly."

I\u2019ve been pretty anxious for the last 1,5 months because I\u2019ve been feeling that something is not rght( not exactly a symptom, I know), I lost weight and when I realized that I started to eat more (about 1500-1900 calories a day, sedentary) and I\u2019ve been having a headache. It\u2019s not there all the time but it\u2019s there everyday next to the left eye (in the picture at green). It develops throughout the day. Usually it doesn\u2019t develops much but about once or twice a week it develops too much and goes even to my face and neck. To give you an example, in the next picture is how it is right now (in the picture at green). It even hurts on my nose but the intensity of pain right now is 1 out of 10. I\u2019ve been to multiple doctors. I had 3 blood tests, a pelvic ultrasound, kidney ultrasound and abdominal ultrasound, ekg, echocardiogram and mouth x-Ray at the dentist and the only thing found was low iron, low ferritin and low folic acid. From the most recent appointment I got a prescription for iron and folic acid. The thing is the doctor just like the others said that all my symptoms are probably due to anxiety and just to ease my mind sent me to do a head ct scan, not because he thinks I need it but to ease my mind. I\u2019m tired of this roller coaster of trying to diagnose myself while everyone tells me it\u2019s just anxiety. I\u2019m frustrated with this. All the exams I did were suggested by me, I just wanted some guidance, someone to tell me what to do so I could just relax a little from this responsibility of being all day playing doctor. I\u2019m not qualified for this responsibility but I feel that I\u2019m kind of alone in this. Now I have to schedule a head ct scan and get exposed to radiation. Should I change it to an mri? I have no idea of what I\u2019m doing but I know that it\u2019s not normal to have a headache for this long always starting at the same spot\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/EFxjjZC.jpg\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/m3zLV6u.jpg"

I am also very sensitive to temperature change it seems and will be sweatier than when my husband is done working out. I am not premenopausal. Other symptoms are brain fog, joint and muscle pain, insomnia, tinnitus, and periods of severe unexplained upper abdominal pain. I also had some kind of allergic reaction about 18 months ago they still can\u2019t explain. Ironically I was in hospital already when this occurred and they just gave me a shot of Benadryl IM and it helped but the rest of the night I had shortness of breath and feeling like I couldn\u2019t breathe.

That passed, but then through the whole month of March, from right after my 21st birthday (it actually started after I ate a mini cake), I was having issues with on-and-off nausea, sometimes to the point where I thought I was going to throw up, but I never did. There were absolutely no other symptoms. At the end of March, almost April, I went to see a doctor (of course, it stopped that day), and she said it was likely viral. That stopped on April 14th, but has come back when I get exhausted. It came back in the week leading up to Victoria Day, as well as yesterday. Yesterday saw me drinking a whole bottle of ginger ale (I hate fizz), taking 2 Tums, and chewing a lot of gum to settle my stomach. Yesterday was as bad as in March, but it passed after I got home from work. I've had many days where I haven't felt nauseous, but I've still felt a little \"meh\", but had difficulty placing it.\n\nMore often now, I don\u2019t have nausea, but I have on-and-off (as in like 10 minutes per day, if at all) pain in my abdomen. Sometimes centered, sometimes left, but most often right. It\u2019s never been bad or throbbing, it\u2019s always been just to the point of being annoying; it\u2019s just the location that bothers me, not the intensity. Like I get worse pains from my legs at work than the abdominal pain at its worst. That abdominal pain usually comes with extremely bad gas and goes away almost right after the gas is all passed. Since I would anger everyone around me if I just let it all pass, I go to the bathroom, and sometimes it\u2019s like I sit there for a minute with one long constant fart, then I instantly feel better. I also noticed (recently) that I get some gurgling sounds and a bubbling kind of sensation from my abdominal area, with or without gas or pain, sometimes before and sometimes after eating. I\u2019ve only started to notice a pattern with gluten recently; this past week, I\u2019ve always had pain a few hours after eating pasta, a bagel, or eggo waffles. I also usually have to go to the bathroom when it hurts, and only a bit comes out (because I go like twice a day), and it\u2019s light brown and soft (and long and skinny for the past 2 days), but not diarrhea. I had no pain yesterday, and I also had no pain today after a day of putting aside any kind of sugar and only drinking water. It remains to be seen if that trend will continue.\n\nMy mother told me that based on a family friend's experience with a rupturing appendix, it\u2019s constant and excruciating, not dull and on-and-off. She also said she thinks the symptoms might point towards hepatitis. Her input on the pain made me a lot less worried, but I still have a consultation with my doctor in 2 weeks (earliest available appointment). There, I\u2019ll ask for an x-ray and/or ultrasound, as well as a blood test for any gluten/lactose intolerances. Are there any other tests I should ask for?\n\nI tried to move up my appointment today, and I was told in a tone that left no room for arguing that my doctor was on vacation until then and that there would be no possibility of seeing another. The only other option is to wait 12 hours at the ER. However, my girlfriend is worried to the point where she's not sleeping, which only makes her (diagnosed) general anxiety worse. Then she stresses me out and I worry about her not sleeping, and I can't sleep.\n\nIs my mother right about the appendix? If so, what could this be? As I mentioned, if it wasn\u2019t in that location and recurring, its intensity wouldn\u2019t be enough for me to go to the doctor. However, I\u2019d like to be prepared for a possible diagnosis and/or reassured in the meantime. Also, other than keeping a pain and food log, what should I be preparing or looking for in the lead-up to the doctor's visit? Can anything be ruled out that might reassure my very worried girlfriend?"

        "reddit": "Hi I\u2019m an 18 year old female from England. all my life I\u2019ve felt \u2018different\u2019 to others. I suffer with social anxiety and panic attacks for a start but there is definitely something else wrong with me and I can\u2019t find out what it is exactly. As a kid in school I used to have a hard time making friends and I\u2019ve always been socially awkward and shy, fortunately I\u2019ve never been bullied over this but I\u2019ve always been known as the quiet and laid back girl. as I\u2019ve grown up, I\u2019ve been able to develop better social skills and I have no problem making friends but I\u2019ve also became more socially anxious as I\u2019ve got older. I still struggle in some social situations, I\u2019m totally fine with people I\u2019m comfortable with like friends and family but I really struggle communicating with people I don\u2019t know that well, it\u2019s like the person will be talking to me but I won\u2019t know what to say next it\u2019s like my mind just goes blank and I have to really think about my responses, I also tend to zone out while someone is talking to me and I really struggle to concentrate on what they\u2019re saying, because of this, I constantly find myself rehearsing and practicing conversations in my head so I don\u2019t mess up next time. I think this is what has caused my social anxiety as now I often avoid talking to people as I don\u2019t want them to think I\u2019m weird or have no personality. I also can\u2019t speak in front of a big group of people. At my college we have to do presentations in front of the class sometimes but my tutor lets me do mine in front of a small group of people that I\u2019m comfortable with as I have massive panic attacks over it, it sounds silly I know, but I find it really difficult.\n\nWhen I was a kid, my mum always tried to get me a diagnosis for something as she could see I was struggling and she always went up the school to ask for me to have extra support but She was always ignored as I was a quiet, well mannered kid who didn\u2019t have any behavioural problems so I was overlooked by the teachers.\n\nIn secondary school my mum thought I might have Autism/Aspergers so she took me to a doctor to be assessed but they said that I only have a few minor traits of it so I can\u2019t be diagnosed. I thought to myself that I might be autistic but when I look it up, I don\u2019t have all of the characteristics, like I know how to conduct myself in social settings and I know what is appropriate and inappropriate behaviour, I know a couple of people who are autistic and most of them do and say things that are strange or inappropriate and they can\u2019t understand that it\u2019s unacceptable so they get classed as \u2018weird\u2019 by peers, I don\u2019t think this at all as I know they can\u2019t help it but I can\u2019t relate to it at all. I can easily read body language and social cues, I have no trouble at being able to tell how someone is feeling and show empathy, I have no problems changing routines, I\u2019m able to understand and take a joke, I\u2019m not sensitive to certain sounds, textures e.c.t, also from what I was looking up, people who are autistic are usually very intelligent and I\u2019m the complete opposite lol. There are a few traits that I am familiar with such as the the fixations thing, when I was little I used to be very obsessed with football and certain cartoon characters, as I got to a teenager I started getting fixated on boys and I constantly talk about my crushes to my friends and family to the point that they get sick of me.\n\nThere are a lot things I struggle with on a daily basis such as: I have a really hard time trying to follow instructions even if they are easy to everyone else, this leads to people getting frustrated with me and it makes me feel really upset, it takes longer for me than other people to learn new skills, I have very poor concentration and I get distracted easily, I have no sense of direction and get lost easily, I\u2019m very clumsy, I have poor co-ordination, I can\u2019t stay focused, I find it difficult to sit still and I fidget a lot, sometimes when I\u2019m at home doing nothing I\u2019ll get up up and walk around as it eases tension, I\u2019m very bad academically especially in English and Maths, at my college you have to do GCSE maths/English as part of your course if you failed your year 11 exams, anyway I retook my GCSE\u2019s for the 2nd time this year and I still got shocking results that I\u2019m too embarrassed to say what I got, what is confusing though as I actually do well on my main course subject I\u2019ve been studying sport and I really enjoy it and find it not too difficult but the maths and English I have literally no hope of passing it ever.\n\nI\u2019ve always been afraid to talk to anyone about how frustrated I feel with all of this, I find it really embarrassing and I don\u2019t want to be judged for it so I bottle it all up. Judging by all my symptoms and problems, would you say that I have some sort of condition or am I really just incredibly dumb\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd"

        "reddit": "First apologies for copying and pasting, the cross post option doesn\u2019t list this community, but posting here for the advice as well.\n\n~~ original post, link at bottom ~~\n\nGood Evening (at least in my time zone) r/Medical! I do want to start this post with by second opinion, I know to always consult a doctor on a real second opinion, but at the current time of writing this, this is a few days out from my appointment, but the problems are persistent. To give a little background and hopefully not reveal to much information, please see list below:\nAge: 20 (almost 21 in November),\nGender: Male,\nHeight: 5\u20199\u201d, \nWeight: 240lbs (on a diet, for anyone who suggests it),\nMedical Condition: Hereditary Spherocytosis - where the red blood cells are missing a protein, and instead of being mostly platelets they are spherical shaped and fragile (the gist of it anyways), just recently Hyperthyroid. I had a splenectomy due to the Hereditary Spherocytosis.\n\n\nSo, rewinding to Friday (23/08/2019) while waiting for my brother to get off of work, I was in my car chewing some gum when I bit wrong somehow, and my jaw started hurting. Enough to warrant me going into the store and buying extra strength acetaminophen (500MG) to help alleviate the pain. Took two as the bottle recommended. After ~10 minutes of taking the medicine I started to feel extremely light headed. About 20 minutes after that, my face and tongue were starting to get numb. My brother drove me to the ER. (I have never had a reaction like that to any medicine in the acetaminophen family, even the extra strength). The ER nurse came in and asked what happened, after telling what happened, they gave me some medicine intravenously. About 30 minutes later, the ER doctor comes in, does the normal thing of getting the story, checking vitals, etc. At this point he noticed that my heart rate was bouncing between the 41 and 67, with it hanging around 52 a majority of the time when it didn\u2019t drop. It was also at this point I felt as if my actual heart was aching. (Imagine you\u2019ve come down the the seasonal flu/cold, and when you first wake up how your whole body aches down to your joints and muscles, that\u2019s what it felt like but only my heart.) Due to the hospital having no cardiovascular department that transferred me via ambulance to another hospital. After arriving they run a few tests including stress tests, EKGs, Echos, blood cultures, urine analysis, etc. All of the tests came back showing nothing abnormal going on with my heart. The blood cultures came back indicating hyperthyroidism. After monitoring a little more, they released me, told me to follow up with my PCP, and prescribed .025mg of Thiamazole at one oral tablet per day on an empty stomach.\n\nFast forwarding to today:\nTaking the medicine and then heading off to church, I didn\u2019t feel any symptoms at all. Upon arriving at church, and being stationary for a few minutes I started to feel lightheaded and dizzy (although not in as extreme severity as Friday night) for approximately 5 minutes at a time, 6 times today. When feeling lightheaded and dizzy, I also felt as if my heart rate was slowing down again, but I powered through it (maybe not the smartest). During the middle of church I started to feel a very sharp pain in my right thigh from the pelvis to about halfway down the thigh. It was on and off with no correlation in what seemed like to the lightheaded and dizziness. As I\u2019m writing this, it has started to pick up in both legs at the same location in each. The ache in my heart is still very persistent. A new symptom I\u2019m feeling, is as if my throat is a little tighter. Doesn\u2019t seem like it\u2019s obstructing anything as I can still swallow and breathe, but definitely tighter. Throat also was highly sore this morning now that I think about it.\n\nAnd this is where I\u2019m at with it. The major thing I\u2019m asking, with these symptoms persisting, should I make a visit to my local hospital and have them monitor me again? Of course, not looking at Google as a medical professional, but reading common symptoms for hyperthyroidism, it mentions arrhythmia of the heart (but often faster rates). With my heart rate getting so low, I\u2019m wondering if something else is at play, but just the original diagnosis was hyperthyroidism or it being a counterpart to something larger going on. Please all advice and help is greatly appreciated!\n\nEdit ** \nThe doctors at both hospitals came by and stated that what was happening didn\u2019t seem to be any reaction to the acetaminophen that I took, if that helps anything.\n\n[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/medical/comments/cvh3y4/second_opinionis_this_normal_serious/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app)"

A few of the sensations on my head include liquid moving on around my scalp, prickling sensations, biting sensations, vibrating sensations, etc. I have never seen anything moving around in my head and neither has anyone else so it is possible it is related to my severe anxiety/social anxiety disorder. \n\nIt is so hard to focus on anything in life (at times) because this sensation is almost always present. It never goes away and is basically a pain in the ass 24/7. Luckily there is no pain associated with this. I've noticed when I touch part of the temples in my upper forehead at the corners and also various parts of my head I can feel a stronger sensation appear (at times, not always). When my anxiety is worse than usual it seems more potent. I have had an MRI and nothing bad came of it, and I don't have any vitamin deficiencies.

        "reddit": "Hi! I am a relatively healthy 38 yo male. I want to preface this with the full disclosure that I am aware that I have pretty severe health anxiety and I know that I google my symptoms waaaay too much, which I'm sure has likely exacerbated the issues I've been having. I also want to say that I realize that all of my problems are likely not connected, but I feel like the more information I give, the more accurate a picture I am painting. \n\nA little back story: back around 2008, I had a colonoscopy and upper gi done because I was having some stomach problems. I believe they said I had gastritis and duodenitis... And they also found that I had a hiatal hernia, which I've been taking medicine (Prilosec and more recently, Nexium) to manage ever since. Also, for several years now, my memory has been kind of... off. It's weird. I can only describe it by saying that my memories (whether short-term or long-term) feel more like remembering a dream, and I haven't had a strong emotional attachment to my memories in years. I've never been to a therapist, but I was diagnosed with generalized anxiety in my early 20s by an urgent care doctor. They tried to give me various drugs to treat it, but they all made me feel really, really bad, so I learned to manage my anxiety on my own.\n\nAbout a year ago, I was feeling lots of constant fatigue, and was having some (mild) burning pains in my head... Of course, I convinced myself then that I had meningitis (or worse). They did some blood work and I was actually diagnosed with mono (at 37, fun!). Okay, fine, we treated it and it seemed to subside.\n\nThen, at the beginning of last January, I started having some similar symptoms, but way worse fatigue and my neck had started getting really stiff and I began having burning pains in my shoulders. Again, none of these pains were really that bad, but definitely there and pretty constant. Then I started feeling a pain in the right side of my throat...like something was in there. My GP did bloodwork, ultrasound of my throat/thyroid and more bloodwork - all clean. My anxiety by this time had me extremely worked up and I had convinced myself that I had throat cancer. Finally, I had a CT scan done of my throat. It came back all clear. Shortly after the CT results, I started feeling much better.\n\nI want to add in here that a few months ago, I started noticing that if I ate any meat - especially smoked meat - my bowel movements would smell exactly like that meat. It worried me, but not enough to go see a doctor right away. \n\nFast-forward to almost 3 weeks ago. Besides some mild depression, I had been feeling relatively fine since my episode in January. Me and my daughter went to eat Japanese (not sure if it's important, but I had some raw tuna nigiri). A little bit after, I started feeling terrible. Not sick like I was going to throw up, but like just *bad* all over. Just bleh... I wanted to lie down. Then over the next few days, I started noticing that sometimes right after I would eat.. Or sometimes if I hadn't eaten in a while, I would get that same feeling again. I also started having some mild stomach discomfort at this time. So I went back to see my GP. She did some blood work, which came back clean. After I had been feeling this way (now I had begun having mild pain on both of my sides... Like, my flanks, where my kidneys are) for about a week, she told me she thinks it's a muscular issue and to take some Ibuprofen and call back in two days if I was still feeling bad.\n\nSo now I figured it was time to see a different doctor.\n\nAbout two weeks into feeling like this, my mom wanted to get me in to see her doctor, but I had taken a day off and really wanted to get in to see somebody that particular day, so I got an appointment with a nurse practitioner at the same clinic as my mom's GP. She takes more blood, does some x-rays of my abdomen, and takes some stool samples. All come back clean. She decides to give me some antibiotics, just kind of shooting in the dark (no diagnosis). I take one dose (Lavaquil) and then stop because I read all over the internet that there are lots of really bad potential side effects associated with that drug. I do think maybe it's relevant to point out that, despite my anxiety about that antibiotic's possible side effects, I felt the best I've felt through this whole thing for the one day after I took that one dose. \n\nSo I finally get in to see my mom's GP. He still doesn't have any clue what could be wrong with me. By this time, I've been googling my symptoms so much, I've gone from thinking I have mastocytosis, to pancreatitis, to fibromyalgia, to finally thinking that I might have MS. The doctor wants to take more blood to check my thyroid function (even though I had it checked back in January) and to check for signs of rheumatoid arthritis. I mention that I have been been having some memory issues and sometimes my feet would be slightly numb, so he also sets me up with an appointment with a neurologist.\n\nHe gave me dicyclomine for stomach issues and meloxicam for my muscle pains. After a few doses of each, I had to stop taking both, as they didn't seem to be helping much and they put me in an awful brain fog.\n\nSo that's where I am now, this has been going on for almost 3 weeks. Currently waiting on the labs I mentioned above to come back. The dull pain on both sides is still there. I have constipation and diarrhea alternating at this point. I have a constant stiff neck and burning pain (not severe) in both my shoulders, but mostly my right shoulder and up into my neck (same as the pain I thought was throat cancer back in January). I feel out of it, extremely weak and just \"bleh\" all over most of the time. My stomach constantly feels just kind of achy, like I'm hungry, even if I've eaten. My appetite comes and goes. I get random tingles and sometimes sharp pains in random spots all over my body. Sometimes, my chest feels tight and I feel short of breath, but it's never very bad. I also have been getting random itching on my skin, with no hives or rash... Most commonly on my chin. \n\nOne more thing is that I noticed that I have a very small (smaller than a pea) lump in my groin region where my leg meets my abdomen. I haven't thought much of it or mentioned it to my doctor since there is also some stretch marks in that same area and I distinctly remember having a bad ingrown hair or pimple there at one point, and it feels like it's part of my skin, like scarring maybe - not mobile like you hear lymphoma-related lumps being. I haven't really been concerned about it up until now. I plan on bringing it up at my next appointment though. \n\nI should point out that my bowel movements no longer smell like meat at this time and I haven't had any blood in my stools, so that's good I guess. \n\nI guess I'm just trying to supplement my GP's work looking into this with some ideas for what to start looking for. Or maybe someone to tell me I'm crazy and to stop worrying about everything so much. I know I need a massage and I know I need to see a therapist, but I want to figure out why I feel so awful at the moment and I'm going nuts just lying in bed, waiting on lab results and follow-up appointments. \n\nTL;DR: have felt like crap for nearly 3 weeks and I desperately want to figure out what's going on"

I started making more guttural noises.\n\nI was terrified the rest of the summer that it would continue happening the next school year, which turned out to be the case. I remember the ticcing in the back of my throat continuing that summer and it felt like my breathing was voluntary, like I had to remember to breathe every single breath by thinking about it. I felt like I could never get a good enough breath, and I felt near fainting often.\n\nIt manifested with severe problems in classes which were virtually silent. In a journalism class where I could go off to the computer room and could \"grunt\" (make vocal tics), I was OK. In classes where you could hear a pin drop, I felt like I had to keep the tics from coming out, and it made me feel like I was going to pass out to the point I kept having to run out of the classroom. I eventually would sit in the hallways trying to hear the teacher without bothering everyone. Because I was taking mostly AP courses, the guidance counselor told me I had no alternatives (I asked about home based alternatives).\n\nBut even outside the classroom something drastically changed. I had been able to read for pleasure, and I got to the point where I could not focus enough to read for school. To manage, I would read the textbooks out loud to myself because if I looked at the pages I couldn't focus. I used to be a voracious reader and read \"above my grade level.\"\n\nI wonder if it changed because I had finally met my match with AP and college courses? Is it possible I could have had ADHD all along but been able to compensate with a high level of intelligence?\n\nThe reason I'm curious about this is the psychiatrist I eventually saw in 10th grade put me on 2 mg Ativan daily with another 2 mg to take as needed per day. This was very bad treatment in retrospect. And it was the only help I got--almost no family involvement, no school help, no therapy, etc.\n\nThe Ativan helped a little at first and I kept taking it because by this point the teachers had become so concerned with my fidgeting, constant movement, leaving the class, eating cough drops/mints nonstop because I felt like I couldn't ever get a deep enough breath and in vain I ate them to feel the air against my throat, that they did what was called a child study. Unbeknownst to me, the guidance counselor observed me for a week in my classes, wrote up a report, and had my mom come in to meet with me and my teachers for a plan. Part of that plan was that I had to continue taking my medication\u2014which obviously wasn't even working and in retrospect was deleterious (and I am now tolerant and dependent on).\n\nMy mental and physical health deteriorated over high school. I couldn't sit through the SATs even. I didn't even know about accommodations at that time. So what happened was that one time during the SATs I focused on the verbal, one time I focused on the math, and my combined score was decent enough to get nto college.\n\nThroughout all this time I saw the psychiatrist's wife but only ever 6 months (i believe she was a nurse or maybe nurse practitioner).\n\nIn 12th grade things had gotten so bad that I saw the psychiatrist himself again. He told me that he wanted to test me for ADHD and that the only way to test for it was to put me on the medication for it. If I got better it meant I had ADHD and if  I got worse it meant I didn't.\n\nSo he took me off Ativan and onto Adderall for one week as a test.\n\nI still remember that week very vividly.\n\nI had two AP exams, and they are the only two I sat through my entire high school career in their entirety without having to leave.\n\nI was shaky--like a caffeinated shaky--but what I had been calling \"anxious\" was largely gone.\n\nWhen I went back to see him, I tried describing how things were different. Part of the problem I think was that he was not a native English speaker, and I am quite verbose.\n\nI told him how I had been both shaky/nervous but also feeling better. There was an unusual experience for me that I described which ultimately led him to believe I did not have ADHD.\n\nI had such bad anxiety that I normally didn't ever just live in the moment or do things that were enjoyable. I couldn't enjoy things.\n\nAnd during the week of that experiment, I went to a meadow behind my house after school and sat down in the grass in the sun. It was very out of character for me. School was usually such a painful experience and torment that I would go home and do homework and fall asleep by 6 or 7 PM.\n\nSo I thought it was significant that I was just sitting out in a meadow, yet I still had \"shakes\" but not as bad as what I had been describing as anxiety.\n\nUnfortunately in describing this to the psychiatrist, I used the word euphoric. But it wasn't euphoric. It was relatively euphoric for me to do something like just sit in the sun versus the hell I was used to.\n\nHe said people with ADHD don't feel euphoric on Adderall, and so he said I didn't have it and put me back on the Ativan.\n\nIt's been a long road since then, but I still wonder about it from time to time. The reason I thought about it now was someone was telling me they took a break from Twitter to just read regular books, and  mentioned how I hadn't been able to read a book since before 10th grade. I used to read before that for pleasure.\n\nBut around that age it became impossible. When I try to read a book, I will read the first line and I have so many thoughts about it. I'll have so many sensations in my body or other foci. Or notice floaters in my eye. Etc.\n\nI have said for years that I can copy-edit faster than I can read\u2014meaning I can scan a document looking for mistakes (things that are novel) faster than I can read for just comprehension.\n\nAnd so since 10th grade or so I've been better without output of information than input of information, which is why I couldn't just sit in classes taking in information. I can't even watch a TV show without pausing it very frequently to do other things, often OCD behaviors but often just because I can't focus that long.\n\nOnly by age 26 was I finally diagnosed with Tourette's, which was the behavior that in high school and my one year at college Iwas trying so hard to suppress. I have the problem of benzodiazepine dependence, and I know that I have anxiety.  But I don't know what the monumental shift was around 10th grade. Was it the level of material (AP and college courses unveiling ADHD that had been accommodated by a high level of intelligence up to that point?\n\nI don't ask this because I want to take more medications. I have a painful path off of the benzodiazepines as it is, so I am not interested in taking another controlled substance. I see a psychiatric NP now, but I think my history of anxiety has followed me for so long that it's hard for people to see much more than that. And I definitely do have severe anxiety problems, and right now in particular severe OCD. I'm just more curious about the origin and how I got to where I am. I like very much to feel in control. I don't like feeling sedated, etc. And at times I've thought I felt better when my head is clearer. And I wonder if it's possible to have ADHD such that you feel out of control and unable to handle stimulus and that leads to the trappings of anxiety.\n\nI don't know how related it is. But this same year in 10th grade I lost a lot of stamina. I had been quite good at sports, and I went from that to feeling like I couldn't even do much in gym class. I found old notes from a teacher who wrote that I always looked hot, sweaty, and sick. I believe I had mono that year. I've since been diagnosed with chronic reactivated EBV. I've progressively lost more and more ability to get around without any diagnosis as to why. I was a great tennis player in middle school. I ran a 7:30 mile. But by high school I would struggle to play even social tennis with my friends who I had previously been able to easily beat. I would have to make jokes about \"tennis breaks\" and would bring snacks as an excuse to sit down between games--very easy games. Today I would be totally out of breath and have a very high heart rate just swinging a tennis racket. There are times I can't even stand because I get so tachycardic (for which I take the bisoprolol)."

I have been dealing with anxiety disorder and post concussion syndrome for the past 2 years or so but about 7-8 weeks ago I experienced a very stressful and traumatic event which I won\u2019t get into but which really shook me up severely. A few weeks after it happened I began to notice hair shedding on my pillow when I\u2019d wake up in the morning and hair would also come out when I took a shower or brushed my hair. When my hair is wet it really seems to come out a lot. Here are some pictures (all from within the last week or so) of my hair dry, wet and from various angles. this is my hair wet right out the shower this is my hair dry currently from various angles (In the pic from the above view I\u2019m in the yellow shirt) here are some photos of my hair from a couple years ago (please don\u2019t judge my crunchy high school photo shoots) This kinda freaked me out at first and I researched online to find that stress can sometimes cause hair loss to happen. It did say this hair loss was most often temporary and your hair could grow back if your stress levels calmed down but obviously i have no way of knowing if this will be the case for me. My dad is bald and everyone on my moms side of the family has hair, even into old age. If anyone could please help me out here and tell me what they make of my situation it would be extremely appreciated.

I\u2019m not currently taking any medications aside from a multivitamin and a b complex supplement. I was on lexapro, which helped to a degree but had side effects like increased thirs, headaches, and utter loss of libido that caused issues with my relationship. I see a therapist and had been doing quite well for months (although mild depression was still an issue but better than before) until I went from Paragard iud to nuvaring. The last three months have made me feel like I\u2019ve been waking around with the worst pms of my entire life. I\u2019ve been irritable, had insane mood swings, felt the most depressed I\u2019ve ever felt in my life, saw a return of ocd thoughts/behaviors, had anxiety so bad I\u2019m vomiting. Needless to say I\u2019m going back to the Paragard as dealing with painful cramp is a piece of cake compared to this hell. I took nuvaring out 4 days ago, on schedule after being on it for 3 months. I\u2019m currently on my period. The mental health stuff has subsided slightly but I\u2019m still incredibly anxious and irritable. \n\nMy question is how long will the hormones from nuvaring be in my system after stopping? Is it worth getting my hormones checked to see if there is some kind of hormonal imbalance? Should I consider having my thyroid levels checked? (TSH before starting nuvaring was normal at 1.25. No other thyroid levels were checked. Can I take supplements like Vitex or DIM to help regulate my hormones? I haven\u2019t responded well to most antidepressants so I\u2019m realllly wanting to avoid going that route. With that in mind is there anything I can do to help manage these nightmarish symptoms? This is literally the worst I\u2019ve ever felt and xanex (prescribed as needed), which I very rarely take except when REALLY need is the only thing getting me through. Could SAM-E help for depression stuff since that was a bit of an issue before or would it be better to hold off?"

It's never been painful to walk on other than the few hours after it happened, which made me think it's not broken. 2 weeks out and it's still just as tender to the touch as it was the day after the injury, and on papation there is a tender mass on the 2nd metatarcel extending into the space between the 1st and 2nd metatarcel. Pain is bearable at a 4 or 5, but extended pressure to the area is intolerable. \n\nMy first thought is that it's localized swelling to the area. Deeper swelling is assumedly firmer than surface swelling, but this mass could indicate a crack and subsequent osteoblast activity, no?\n\nI googled if you can break your foot and not know, and most results say if it is broken you'll have trouble bearing weight on it at all, and if you can, symptoms will worsen over time.\n\nI can bear weight, it's not worsened, but the localized tenderness feels very fresh and acute. Just as if I had injured it earlier today.\n\nShould I give it more time, or should I head to the doc? I'm afraid of a hairline fracture, but I'm not sure if there is treatment for that other than rest. It's not painful unless I touch it and even then it's just tender. Pain is never more than a 5 or 6. It feels like a fresh bruise with lingering discomfort when touched.\n\nSide note: on Tuesday I'm planning a day at the state fair. I have a wheelchair to use strategically throughout the day to rest my body, so if my foot hurts I will use the wheelchair more, but I want to know if this may cause further injury if it is indeed cracked or broken."

But back to this cte thing, just writing this sentence I lost my concentration for about 20 seconds and didn\u2019t know what to write and I couldn\u2019t think, then there are times where I would zone out for about 30 seconds, and Ik I was thinking but I can\u2019t remember what I was thinking about or what I looking at when I was driving home.

Idk what else to write on about this but maybe it can help if a doctor sees it or somthing or if there is a better subreddit to write this to. Note that I am not self diagnosing myself with cte nor could I, it is a relatively new concept about 10 years or so and has been mainly focused on pro athletes, but I feel like it could be more dangerous to middle schoolers and high schoolers, and possibly college football players since male brains don\u2019t stop growing and developing till the early 20\u2019s. But after hearing about symptoms and everything and I fall into the category of playing a sport that can cause this.

Medications: Diane 35. \n\nHey guys, \n\nSo I\u2019ve had some symptoms for about six months plus, and they are progressively getting worse. Extreme fatigue, to the point where I can\u2019t even get to class/can\u2019t stay awake when I do (yes, literally falling dead asleep in classrooms). I have periods of low grade fevers, mainly in the early hours of the morning/waking. These periods come and go (eg might have them for a month, then not, then again). I\u2019ve had an enlarged spleen (confirmed by a GP) which is also painful at times. I\u2019ve had a loss of appetite and often only have one meal a day, and often don\u2019t want food at all. As a consequence, I have lost some size but not a heap. Recently I\u2019ve had a mild barking cough every now and then for no discernible reason, and a tight chest. \n\nThen, three weeks ago, I found a lump on my neck. It came up literally over night. One day I didn\u2019t have it, the next I did. It\u2019s off the midline of my neck, to the left, in the \u2018anterior triangle\u2019. It\u2019s quite big (close to golf ball size, maybe ping pong ball or bigger). It feels completely solid, as solid as one of those rubber balls you play with as a kid, the hard ones. I can\u2019t move it around with my fingers. It doesn\u2019t move per say when I swallow or stick my tongue out, like, the lump is still in the same place, but it moves in the sense that it\u2019s attracted to its surroundings and its surroundings move (if that makes sense). It doesn\u2019t hurt, not tender. \n\nAnyway, I got an ultrasound today. The technician looked quite grave and said she wanted to show the doctor the images and see if he wanted to look himself. He did. He had a look and asked her \u2018is there any vascularity\u2019 and she said \u2018there\u2019s some just here\u2019 and pointed to the outside edge of the lump. It was big, like very obvious on the ultrasound, circle, black. \n\nThe radiologist told me I\u2019d likely be referred to an ENT and have a CT, surgery may be an option depending. He said it could be a cyst. \n\nNow, obviously there\u2019s more tests to be done. But I feel like my GP (and I suppose the radiologist, although he didn\u2019t ask me about symptoms and didn\u2019t have any information on my referral other than to scan the neck) aren\u2019t understanding that my symptoms OTHER than the lump are truly concerning me. The lump is getting bigger but it isn\u2019t impacting my life - I\u2019m so tired I literally can\u2019t quite function. \n\nI don\u2019t know whether the lump and symptoms are actually connected, but I want a solution. \n\nAlso how common is it for someone to suddenly have a Thyroglossal cyst issue, golf ball sized, over night and in their mid twenties? I\u2019ve never had a lump in my neck before. I also hadn\u2019t had a cold or flu except three months prior I had a week long cold. \n\nAny suggestions as to what could be going on and how much to push for a solution?"

One of which is that the fatigue that i was already experiencing has increased DRAMATICALLY. Not just tired, i can barely keep my eyes open for most of my work day. I sleep through weekends. My muscles get tired to the point where it hirts with minimal use (washing my hair, body, applying face lotions, etc). And i suddenly have the joints of a 90 year old. And by this i mean they HURT. Standing up from a chair makes my hips and knees feel like theyre going to explode, and forget standing up from sitting on the floor. Ive lost a lot of flexibility in a lot of places.\n\nI would have preferred to keep the hot flashes. \n\nBut back to my original point. Friday afternoon i went back to urgent care for the suffocating sensation. This pa was actually concerned! I didnt get into any of the other issues though, only the feeling in my neck. She ordered cbc, tsh, and metabolic panel. \n\nThey came back normal.\n\nI had some values that were borderline, but as far as i can tell they arent noteable\nMean platelet vol was 11.4,\nMonocytes were 11.8%,\nMonocyte AC was .94,\nProtein was 8.4,\nTSH was 4.64\n\nThere were a couple things that came back on the low end of the normal scale but other than that, everything was pretty much right in the middle of the normal scale.\n\nSo now i guess i just feel like im just lazy/crazy/both"

        "reddit": "Hey!\nSo I\u2019ve been actively worried about my mom for about a year now. Shes 64 female, 200 pounds 5\u20196\u201d. She has diabetes. She\u2019s always had some issues with depression, I honestly think she has some more complex mood disorder then she realizes. She\u2019s always been on Prozac and other antidepressants.\n\nThe last year though she\u2019s been getting harder and harder to deal with. She seems to get extremely triggered easily and breaks down. Her behavior seems more strange. It\u2019s hard to explain but she seems more stubborn/confused and at times angry. \n\n A good example was she came over to my house today. I lived here for about 9 months. She\u2019s been over about a dozen times. I showed her a picture on my phone of my cat in a part of my house. She doesn\u2019t normally see this part of my house but she\u2019s been in that room about 3 times. She asks me where it\u2019s at. I tell her. She acts confused. I tell her exactly where that room is located and she still looks confused. I take her to that room. She acts like she\u2019s seeing that room for the first time.\n\n I tell her we are having dinner outside- please go outside. She looks at the backdoor confused. She looks at me confused and says through this door? She\u2019s been outside at our house almost every time she\u2019s come over. \n\nHer fathers birthday was on the 14th. I remember very clearly this date. She called me on the 13th to talk about her dads birthday- she is sad because she misses him. I act surprised because it\u2019s not her dads birthday yet but she keeps saying it\u2019s his birthday today. I assume she forgot the date since she\u2019s retired and say it\u2019s not the 14th yet. She then swears up and down his birthday was the 13th. I give up correcting her. When I saw her today and she brings this up.\n\n\nShe\u2019s gone to the emergency room multiple times this month over diarrhea. I wish my dad would have told me but I guess she was getting hysterical saying she was going to die. But it\u2019s just diarrhea. Every time there has been nothing wrong- just some upset stomach. \n\nMy dads health isn\u2019t great and I\u2019m worried she\u2019s going to drain their savings with her antics and kill him by wearing him down with her behavior. There\u2019s a million more little things- like how she\u2019s demanding they install new air conditioning when the air conditioning they have works fine. Or fighting with their neighbor because she \u201ctripped\u201d over water from their sprinklers.\n\n I want to try to suggest she get tested but I\u2019m not sure these are signs or she\u2019s just turning into a bitter old person. I\u2019m sure if I say this I will piss her and my dad off but she\u2019s acting pretty unhinged and my dads been enabling it. \n\nHer father had a pretty steady decline that started around 65 but he also had 3 strokes and an auto accident.  During her recent er visits they concluded she was healthy-she has a blood test each time and nothing was off other then she needs to loose weight. Any advice?"

        "reddit": "Hello. I'm a 30 year old white male; height is 6'2\" and weight is around 175lbs. Not currently on medications but I do smoke cannabis (vaping as well as edibles). And that's where this brings me...  I'm not sure where to post this, but this seems like the place to get answers.\n\nI recently got into vaping cannabis oil - probably started just shy of a month and just decided to stop (this past Friday, 8/23). Mostly due to the recent news scare of folks who have a lung illness and are finding it linked to vaping. I convinced myself I don't really need this stuff - smoking weed usually causes me to cough a lot, and the high I don't like compared to the high I get when doing edibles. So, I just decided to stop. I've done edibles before, sometimes with regular / frequent use and have stopped before and didn't face any difficulties. But it seems because I was smoking frequently for a month, I feel like I'm having withdrawals and it's really scary.\n\nIrritability, tossing and turning in my sleep or not being able to stay asleep. Loss of appetite. Diarrhea. Anxiety and depressed feelings. Am I actually going through withdrawal? How do I cope with this?\\\\\n\n*EDIT 1: Thank you for those who replied to give their support on this. I don't even know who you are, but knowing that I'm not alone in this battle gives me the will power to fight this.*\n\n*EDIT 2: I wanted to keep track of the days as well as record my feelings and things that have occurred - for tracking progress as well as anyone else out there who may stumble upon this - to understand this and to understand they are not alone. That, and reporting on this each day will be my way of saying, \"Yes. I. Can.\"*\n\n**DAY 1 \\[Friday, 8/23\\]**: Decided to stop with vaping cannabis. Don't recall any side effects; felt normal.\n\n**DAY 2:** Went hiking, was out with  sister, who was in town visiting me for the weekend, and my girlfriend. We were very active that day and I did about 11 miles. I had a great appetite - probably due to how active I was. I don't really recall any of the symptoms associated with withdrawals. Everything seemed fine until later that night when I had insomnia. No matter what I tried to do I just couldn't sleep.\n\n**Day 3:** Spent the morning outside by the pool soaking up some vitamin D. I started feeling depressed and fatigued. I opened up to my girlfriend about my situation but didn't attribute anything yet to it being withdrawal. I thought some of my anxiety and irritability originated from her being out with her girlfriends at a club the night prior. I knew I was being totally insecure and jealous with my feelings and worrying about whom she might be dancing with, which is somewhat out of the norm for me, especially with her. Our relationship is young, but its solid and I trust her deeply. But I think this reaction bleed into with some of the withdrawal symptoms that were just coming into play. I spent the night out in city and felt okay, but my appetite was very much suppressed and had trouble focusing on conversations. Woke up in the middle of the night hot and sweaty. I went to get out of bed as I felt nauseous and was heading to the bathroom and then immediately felt cold. My teeth were chattering and I jumped back into bed under my covers only to feel like I was set on fire. What the hell is happening?\n\n**Day 4 \\[The day of reckoning\\]**: Woke up completely fatigued. I was up way earlier than my alarm and couldn't fall back to sleep. I started to pace back and forth in my apartment. Started having intrusive thoughts, thoughts of not wanting to be here anymore. My mind was looking for an escape. I've had depression before way back in high school and had thoughts of suicide once before. This is definitely dark territory, and while scary as fucking hell, was also familiar to me. I  know suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem. But even knowing this, knowing that I have complete control, and knowing I would ever attempt to hurt myself, it's still extremely scary to have these types of thoughts and feelings.\n\nI tried cover this all up as I had to drop my sister off for her to head back home. Afterwards, I went to work. During my commute in, I decided to give my parents a call and talked with my mom. Moms always know best, right? Trying to talk this over with my family and friends is extremely hard, extremely. Especially when you know you are loved by so many people and to think why the hell would I even be thinking to take my own life when I have so much to be grateful for. My mom is the closest in my family to understand anxiety and depression. She knows its a fucking hell hole. If anyone else reads this, please talk with someone. Talking about your feelings is so important.  \n\nWith all this going on in my mind, I knew something was wrong and my first instinct was to research withdrawals from cannabis because that is the only thing I could pinpoint this too. And sure enough... Bingo. With some help with fellow strangers on the internet, I stumbled across all sorts of nightmarish stories of those who have gone through with this. Anonymous people out there all going through the same ordeal - I am not alone.\n\nAside from my family, I opened up to my girlfriend about it some more; feeling anxious and terrified that I would be judged, but that was not at all the outcome. I took my lunch break out in my car in the parking lot and she wanted to Facetime me as she knew something was wrong. It was an emotional conversation to say the least. But it was a conversation that made me fall for her even more - a beautiful person, a beautiful soul, and it was so great to find someone who truly understands the feeling and emotions that come with having anxiety and depression.\n\nI went to the doctor later in afternoon to see if there was anything that can help remedy the side effects. The doctor prescribed Alprazolam - a very powerful drug that can be very lethal if not taken correctly and can lead to dependence and addiction. Hell nah. The last thing I want right now is to put another drug in me. \n\nAfter the doctor's visit, I drove to the grocery shopping to pick up healthy foods - bananas, grapes, raisins, granola, Gatorade, and coconut water, and cracker. Stuff that I felt like I could nibble on and not upset my stomach.\n\nSpent the evening at my girlfriend's place and felt okay. Appetite is still very much suppressed, felt somewhat nauseous, and still going to the bathroom with diarrhea. Yet, I could still feel and hear my stomach growl from hunger. Fell asleep just fine - having my girlfriend beside me was ultra comforting. Awoke in the middle of the night, this time having some intense dreams - one that I can recall was opening up the fridge to a bowl of edibles...? WTF? My girlfriend was also awake and knew I was experiencing some intense insomnia. Once again, teeth chattering, shivering, yet I was so damn hot at the same time. I just started started to pay attention to my breathing; taking in deep breaths and counting each one while my girlfriend gave me powerful words of affirmation. I can get through this\n\n**Day 5: Currently underway...**"

Back in November of last year, I got a migraine, I waved it off and kept going with my day it was extremely painful but again it was just a migraine so I didn't see it as an issue since it runs in my family. I continued getting these migraines and they gradually became closer together. Just a few months ago in May they really started picking up becoming every other day and I started getting multiple other symptoms. By July they were a constant 24/7 thing and I couldn't get out of bed since the pain was so intense. Once my mother realized the amount of pain I was in we finally went to the doctor, I was told it was just migraines due to extreme stress which made sense at the time but the problem was that the pain in my head wasn't just on one side or spot it was everywhere. So I got prescribed Naproxen and took that twice a day in hope to stop the pain, after two weeks of taking the Naproxen I had gotten even worse so once again I went to the doctor. That time they gave me Topiramate to take daily along with Ibuprofen to also take daily. At that point I was taking Naproxen twice a day, Ibuprofen 2-3 times a day, then the Topiramate once a day, I was also referred to a neurologist which I have yet to hear from. Something that I believe is important to take note of is that I have medical and have not been established with a doctor yet - I have an appointment set in October to get that so I haven't gotten blood or urine tests taken due to this issue. Here's my list of symptoms: feeling lethargic, unable to sleep, muscle weakness, shortness of breath, loss of appetite, pain in my head, extreme nausea, extreme dizziness, my body temp is all of the place, sore throat, feeling exhausted 24/7, &amp; light and noise sensitivity. I'm really hoping someone can help lead me somewhere since right now I am feeling completely hopeless. I'm supposed to be starting my Sophomore year in HS but due to this, I've had to go homeschool. I just want to get somewhere with it I'd really take any help right now."

I live in MA.\n\nA couple of days ago, I had a pretty bad headache which was definitely out of the norm for me. I thought it might have been dehydrated and unrelated to this, but now I'm not so sure. This morning I kept waking up because I was very cold. When I got up, I felt shaky, as if my blood sugar was low. About halfway through my cereal I still felt that way so I ate some more, but I still feel shaky. Almost as if I've drank too much caffeine (which I do not), and I'm honestly having trouble typing this out. I'm having way, way more typos than usual that I'm having to correct. After breakfast, I had bad abdominal pain and then had diarrhea. Afterward, I got chills, and decided to take a shower. I started feeling nauseous so I got out of the shower early. I was trying to do some math calculations and realized I couldn't do them accurately for some reason. I feel warmer now, but still just \"off.\" My heart rate also feels faster than usual and staring at the computer screen is really bothering my eyes. There's an EEE alert for my area I've been extremely careful to avoid mosquitos the last week or so, but I was definitely exposed before (and had lots of bites). They found a mosquito carrying the disease in my town but there have only been 3 cases in my state so far, and none very close to me. \n\nI want to be the first to say I know EEE is extremely rare and I'm sure my anxiety is making this worse, but is there a chance this could be that? I'm wondering if this could be sun poisoning because I am very sensitive to the sun (Fitzpatrick type I and ginger) and got a moderate sunburn on the back of my neck yesterday. Not severe or 2nd degree, but definitely the most substantial one I've had in a while (I am super careful with sunscreen).\n\nSecondly, I am scheduled to get my wisdom teeth out on Wednesday. When do I need to make a decision about canceling? Is it safe to go under if I feel like this? I already postponed/rescheduled once earlier this month from a job conflict but I leave for college in 2 weeks so it would be super inconvenient to cancel."

        "reddit": "About 2 months ago out of nowhere while driving down the highway I started to get dizzy and had trouble focusing my eyes on the road. This caught me so off guard I started to panic and had to pull over to the shoulder. Since then I have avoided driving on the highway because it seems like when I\u2019m trying to focus on something in the distance, the dizziness and blurred vision sets in. I can manage city streets now because I know it\u2019s going to happen and I can control the feelings of panic at lower speeds. I commute an hour to school 2 days a week in a fairly rural area and the open road with minimal traffic seems to make it worse and come on quicker. Until I took my son to see monster trucks at a tall stadium a few nights ago I didn\u2019t realize it was the distance aspect that was causing all this. While trying to focus on the trucks, my dizziness came back and progressively got worse the longer I tried to watch them. It does go away if I divert my eyes to something closer like the radio in my vehicle or a near by house etc. as soon as I look back at the road, the dizziness returns. Has anyone else experienced this or seen a doctor for it? I don\u2019t know where to start. I have gotten my eyes checked since this all started and my prescription had changed only slightly and my eyeglasses don\u2019t make a difference in regard to the dizziness. \n\nWhite, 28yo female, 5\u2019, 125lbs, general anxiety (undiagnosed)."

        "reddit": "I'm 20M, and the problem began last week on a monday night while I was watching a horror movie. Somewhere around 11PM I think.\n\nAt that moment I had some sort of strange moment where I got rather anxious all out of nowhere. I got a faintly light headed feeling and my breathing felt a bit heavy. I suspect it was a random adrenaline rush or something, after an hour or so it slowly faded away. However, the vague light headed feeling persisted. After that I decided to go to bed, thinking that sleeping might fix it.\n\nIt didn't, and it's been constant ever since. It's rather tough to describe, the closest thing I can think of is the dreary feeling/mood you have when you have the flu, but more mild. I feel a bit detached from my surroundings, a bit fuzzy or foggy. It also fluctuates a little, it becomes worse around evenings and nights, while it seems more faint during the day. I suspect it's more of a psychological than a physical thing, physically I don't really notice anything strange.\n\nI suspect it comes from my lifestyle, which isn't particularly healthy. I've been home for months now, most of the time my average day looked like this:\n\nWake up around 10-11AM. Eat some cookies, then browse reddit on a tablet until lunch time (12:30PM), after lunch time play games and browse reddit on my PC until dinner (6PM). Continue doing so after dinner until around 11PM, then go back to browsing on my tablet downstairs in the living room until bedtime (2:30AM). I also don't eat particularly healthy (mashed potatoes + meat + vegetables, but I generally leave most of the vegetables behind). Sometimes I cycled around town, but not consistently.\n\nThen, after this whole thing started happening last monday, I changed my routine a little by consistently cycling every day for 30 minutes, taking a shower every day, eating a banana every day, meditating for 15 minutes a day and changing my sleep cycle to 0:00AM-9:30AM.\n\nSo far I still haven't been able to get rid of this strange state. What is going on, and how can I get rid of it?\n\nPS: Oh, and I have to say that I've had an even milder variation of this thing before (minus the adrenaline rush). A couple of weeks ago I had it too, but it went away the next day after I went to sleep."

About 4 years ago I had a hernaited nucleus pulposus at the same level which resulted in cauda equina syndrome and prompted immediate surgery. A neurosurgeon performed a laminectomy (from the right side) and my pain and neurological deficits were essentially erased until about a month ago when I slept in weird twisted positon and woke up with severe lower back pain radiating into my toes (specifically on the left side) and have had difficulty sitting up, bending, walking, lifting since then. Based on past experience and my premedical education, I suspected I had a disc reherniation at L5/S1, and was able to get in for a lumbar spine MRI without contrast which indeed revealed a 1.5cm central disc herniation at L5/S1 mildly encroaching on the anterior epidural space (with no central canal stenosis nor neuroforaminal narrowing). I guess my question here is how severe is this injury? From what I understand 1.5cm is pretty massive, and although I don't have photos of the MRI results I can assure you the injury is extremely obvious, but I wasn't entirely sure and wanted to ask. I've experienced some mild numbness/tingling in my left foot and my pain is pretty severe and is consistent with S1 irritation, although I have had 3 previous surgeries on my left hip (which I am currently in physical therapy for) which makes it a little difficult for me to differentiate between pathologies. Also, since I have previously had surgery on the opposite side and with this being my second herniation, does anyone have any idea and what sort of treatments might be employed? I have an appointment with a pain management specialist to discuss epidural cortisone injections in a few weeks, although at this point I've had so many oral steriods (for asthma exacerbations) and injections (9-10 total in 3 joints) my optometrist told me I was starting to get cataracts so I've been trying to avoid steroids as much as possible. Sorry this was so long, I just wanted to seek some outside perspectives while waiting for my appointment with my neurosurgeon in a few weeks. Thanks!! :)"

For about 6 years.\n\nSorry the story is very long:\n\nSince I was about 15 I started having yeast infections and vaginal problems. First time it was just itchy around the vulva so I got some cream and it stopped. Next time it was when I was about 16 and about to go for a school trip. So it was very itchy and burny. So I got nystatinum vaginal tablets and some natamycin cream. It pretty much cured all the symptoms but after I was done with treatment the itchiness would come back. I got a lab test and it showed candida albicans. So I went to gynecologist and got prescribed natamycin cream and natamycin vaginal tablets. And probiotics afterwards. The infections kept on coming back. One time it was a different yeast strain. The other I also had ear yeast infection on top of vaginal one. That's when I got better treatment with higher dose of fluconazol. And cream and regular vaginal antifungals and probiotics always on top of that. After that my infection stopped but the itchiness never went away. Almost every day a few times per day I'd feel quite itchy down there. So I decided to go off sugar for one year. It did help a little as I didn't get any proper infection but the itchiness stayed. \nI only use cotton underwear, never used any products to wash my vagina, only water, always wiped front to back. I also was not overweight or didn't have any other issues. Except for acne. I started throwing away underwear more often.\n At the end of the period infections would come back or symptoms were increased. I used to use pads more then moved to tampons. \nWhen I was 19 I did not have any serious infections but every now and then would get itchy. I did not use any antifungals. And didn't  used antibiotics since the yeast infections started (as far as I can remember). \nI tested my blood sugar levels and everything was fine. \nThe next serious episode hit me after having sex with my boyfriend. We used latex condom. I bought clotrimazole external and  internal cream and after few days I felt better and the infection was not severe. Again the itchiness was till there.\nAfter having intercourse again and also some petting. My vulva was feeling itchy and burny and it stared hurting while I was peeing to the point I was in constant pain. So I went to GP got a swab but nothing was found (could be due to me using the cream) and I asked to do urine test and it turned out I had UTi. I got antibiotics and after taking them the peeing improved and I still used some cream so everything calmed down. This time I forgot to use probiotics. However the infection didn't come back and only itchiness stayed. \nEvery now and then I would get some discharge but I am so helpless I just ignore it. I changed from latex condoms to non latex ones. Although sex would hurt and it would burn a lot afterwards especially inside nearby the urethra area(like the top part of vagina). I haven't had sex for about 2 months and suddenly at the end of my period I got very burny infection. I can see the discharge and it looks like yeast infection. I did not have any sexual contact and haven't inserted anything into my vagina. The only thing is I used pads more this time and maybe ate more sugar than usual. I'm so sick of yeast infection ruining my life. Can anyone help me or have any ideas on what's going on?\n\nEdit: got tested for basic STIs and didn't find anything"

The pain seems like it pulsates at times, and there\u2019s a bit of a dull pain feeling (not all the time but from time to time). Feels a bit better when I extend my back straight and when I pass gas. It also feels tender at times but it could also be because I\u2019m hyper-aware of that area. No other symptoms. Appetite is good, no blood in stool. Did some unrelated CT imaging (had a urachal cyst - congenital) and it did show slight hydronephrosis on the right kidney; doctor said congenital as well and nothing to worry about. I don\u2019t know if any of that is relevant but just throwing it out there. I also have sciatic nerve pain on the right side too. Seems like the right side of my body is just out of whack. Lol. \n\nI did an ultrasound (abdominal and pelvic) a few months ago, just showed some gallbladder sludge (runs in the family too), but everything else was normal. Blood work was normal too. My new doctor suggests that I\u2019m simply feeling my right kidney aorta pulsating and because I\u2019m very skinny, I notice it more. He did an examination and didn\u2019t feel any hernia or anything. I think it\u2019s important to mention that I do have anxiety so I probably intensify it in my head, but I promise that the sensation I describe is very real, not a huge bother but nonetheless concerns me. \n\nThank you so much in advance to everyone that answers!!"

        "reddit": "\u2022 36, 5'7, 170 lbs, male, caucasian (mixed Western and Eastern European)\n\n\u2022 Currently taking hydroxyzine 25mg once a day (but only for 2 days now), a daily multi-vitamin, and the occasional aspirin. Nonsmoker, no recreational drugs, and I haven't had a drink in over a month. \n\n\u2022 Depending on the specific symptoms, issues have been going on for a couple of days, a couple of months, or about 6 months.\n\nAbout 6 months ago, I had about 6 drinks, went to sleep, and woke up with what I thought was a really bad hangover. I almost never have hangovers, and when I do they are mild. But this included severe headache, vertigo, and generally feeling awful all over \u2014 and the symptoms lasted to some degree for about a month.\n\nI took that opportunity to get serious about my health \u2014 I switched to a healthier diet, exercised more, lost about 30 lbs, and cut way down on both sugar and alcohol consumption. I slowly began to feel better, and after about a month I felt pretty decent. The symptoms had completely gone away.\n\nIn June, however, I began feeling them again \u2014 headaches, vertigo, getting exhausted too easily from exertion. This was soon followed by chest discomfort, some chest pains (mostly on the lower and right sides), numbness and tingling in my arms and hands corresponding to my ulnar nerve, and shortness of breath. The symptoms would come and go \u2014 they weren't constant and could change throughout the day. I could get relief from the chest pain and many of the other symptoms by stretching and \"popping\" my chest. I felt a soreness under and around my sternum that felt like I had been punched in the gut recently. There was also a recurring pain on my upper right side which I could feel go all the way back to the shoulder blade. All of this pain never exceeded a 1 on the pain scale, and most of the time it has been less than that.\n\nI went to the doctor for all of this and was diagnosed with bronchitis. He did not think any of my problems were cardiovascular in nature. I did have a cough, but it came and went, and it was always dry. The doctor thought I could ride it out without antibiotics. My symptoms did improve, tho with lots of ups and downs.\n\nIn particular, I was still very frustrated that I was frequently getting winded and downright sick so easily from activities I used to be able to do just fine. I thought perhaps, if there was a cardiovascular issue, potassium might help. About 4 or 5 days ago, I changed my diet to include more potassium rich foods, just to see if it would help. I'm still only consuming about 50-75% daily value of potassium a day.\n\nThe first day, I had horrible painful bloating and diarrhea (the doctor attributed this to the laxative qualities of apricots and coconut, which I had been consuming in abundance). The day after that I felt exceptionally good. And the day after that I felt absolutely terrible, as terrible as I have felt since this began 6 months ago. I felt very weak, disoriented, uncomfortably warm, and I was having notable discomfort and mild pains in the left side of my chest and my left arm (as well as other places) during work. My blood pressure is normally in the 130s/80s range, but I was measuring it in the 150s/90s, and at one point as high as 160/103. I went to the doctor (a different one) first thing in the morning. I told him all of my symptoms, he saw my high blood pressure (which also went down quite a bit during my time there), and checked me out thoroughly. He determined it was caused by anxiety and that the symptoms were almost certainly psychosomatic. To be fair, I have thought before that this might be the case myself. The doctor prescribed me hydroxyzine and sent me on my way, telling me to make a follow-up appointment with my primary care provider (which I can't do, because I am in serious medical debt). I cannot afford to keep going to these doctor's visits.\n\nFor the past couple of days since I have seen the doctor, I've felt somewhat better, but still awful. I feel some tightness and soreness in the left side of my chest and my left arm. I'm fighting a lot of dizziness, and I cannot tell if it qualifies as vertigo or lightheadedness \u2014 it's like both and neither at the same time. I feel tired and worn out. I've laid off most of the potassium rich foods just in case I've overdone it, as I know too much potassium is not a good thing as well. The dizziness is really the worst part of it \u2014 it's impeding my ability to function.\n\nI'm really just fishing for ideas of what might be going on. I cannot afford to keep running back the doctor, especially if nothing gets better as a result. I need ideas to improve my situation. I'm feeling completely alone in this.\n\nOther possibly relevant information:\n\n\u2022 I get back pain and sciatica now and then. I have had chest pains in the past that seemed to be connected to back pain and how I slept.\n\n\u2022 Earlier this year, after the initial onset of symptoms, I had an atypical mole removed from my arm and biopsied \u2014 it came back benign.\n\n\u2022 I have had a history of migraines, but haven't had any in a long time. I did get a sudden onset of mild but constant migraine-like headaches last year, but they only lasted for a few weeks then completely disappeared.\n\n\u2022 I have had a history of abdominal pain and irritable bowel."

        "reddit": "I've had this for literally more than a year. All pretty much same symptoms. When I swallow my saliva, my throat muscles tense up in the closed position for 1-4 seconds and my throat (perhaps upper airway) clenches closed as well. To \"unclench\" these muscles I usually have to exhale or sigh powerfully through my mouth or blow air through my mouth. Similarly, my throat/airway becomes closed when I breath through my nose, often accompanied by the sensation of [patulous eustachian tubes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patulous_Eustachian_tube). This prevents me from speaking clearly. It is profoundly uncomfortable, annoying, and distracting. I've been to 3-4 doctors for this, and none of them have taken it seriously, even having a throat ultrasound done and finding nothing.\n\nOne doctor implied that I might just have anxiety, but this precedes any anxiety. If I lay down e.g. on the ground, then the tension goes away after 5-8 minutes -- regardless of how anxious I am on the ground. If I'm sitting or standing, the tension remains. I have more tension sitting than standing, and more tension standing than walking, but it's still there. I can feel tension on the outside of my neck in what looks like the [SCM muscle](https://learnmuscles.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Lateral-View.jpg). I **do not** have trouble swallowing liquids or foods. It seems to be related to the muscles involved with a smaller amount of liquid (i.e. saliva).  I don't keep the best posture (forward head), however I've tried changing my posture every which way and it's still terrible.\n\nIt's unrelated to allergies, it's unrelated to what I eat, and I don't think it's related to anxiety.

It seems I had my first ever outbreak, I had bad flu symptoms, fever off and on, sore throat and now inside of my mouth, my vagina is so sore that it hurts to walk and I can\u2019t urinate on my own. My last ER doctor thank goodness gave me a pelvic exam and told me she suspects herpes and apologized that no one ran any cultures on me or helped me in any way at the previous two hospitals I visited (so my outbreak was given six days to get worse and worse).  We are waiting on the culture for sure but it\u2019s not yeast, UTI, trich or anything she can rapid test for. She highly suspects genital herpes. The problem is it\u2019s so painful I can\u2019t urinate. Not like \u201cI don\u2019t want to urinate because it hurts\u201d, it is more like a \u201cit\u2019s so absolutely painful that my body stops itself.\u201d I try to push through even though I\u2019m crying and it\u2019s like my body fights against me and will not let it come out. The skin around the area is so sensitive it bleeds to the touch. I had to have a catheter at the hospital and they removed two liters of urine within like 2 minutes because I had so much \u201cbacked up.\u201d It was so fast it prompted them to ask how long it had been since I\u2019d gone. I haven\u2019t been able to poop for about five days now. I have tried attempting peeing in a cold bath, warm bath, with water running over my vagina, with a coat of Vaseline to protect the skin...

It was typically the smell of an electrical fire or over heated electrical cord but now has changed to ammonia or something similar. About a month ago I noticed the scent change and started paying attention to where I was smelling it after I was at the park and had an overwhelming ammonia smell hit me. Also had the same sell hit me while shopping. I have no real idea about how long this has been happening, I always chalked the smell to me having a really good sense of smell. I'm not so sure about that anymore. Sometimes that's all I get, like a few hours ago I smelled really strong ammonia and after 5 seconds it was gone. Now I just have a slight pressure/tingle/ impending shiver feeling that doesn't stop when I do shiver, my tongue feels prickly and I feel off. I wish I could describe it better than \"off\" but I cant put my finger on it. \n\nLast night I had something that freaked me out which is why I'm here. I was reading my kids a bedtime story and get a sudden strong, like made my nose hurt strong, smell of ammonia. No one else in the room could smell it. It was followed by nausea then I felt incredibly sad and my eye started to water.  My head started tingling and I tried to ignore it but I couldn't keep reading, it felt like my brain forgot how to process the words into speech. I closed my eyes until the nausea stopped and 30 seconds later I could read out loud but was messing up words I know I knew. My tongue felt prickly after like I licked a 9v battery. \n\nI've had other instances where I don't have the smell but I'll have the feeling like I need to shiver or I stop being able to focus on anything talk. I know when its happening but cant stop it. I feel like I'm tense which is making my back hurt around shoulders like I've been doing tons of upper body work.   \n\n\nI don't know if this is important but the smell thing has been happening since I can remember, as well as trouble remembering things and focusing. I was born addicted to crack cocaine, when I was 17 I got an E.coli infection in my kidneys, 107.5 temp when I was admitted into the hospital, it took 3 days to get it under control and an additional 2 weeks before I was released. I've also been knocked out 2 times that I know of, kicked in the face by a horse, car accident where the dashboard won and I use to be a heavy drinker before quitting 8 years ago. The constant tingling is under 2 years old, it started after I had my last baby. I got an epidural, went to lay down after and my head started tingling then I couldn't speak. The nurse was calling my name but I couldn't figure out how to talk. 15 or so seconds passed before I could blurt out a \"All good!\" then apologized for forgetting how to talk. She didn't seem concerned so I tried to ignore it when it happened after. \n\nWTF is it? Would OH cause this? Could this be anxiety? \n\n\\*I told my PCP about this but forgot the smell thing, he ran a CDC and tested my Iron because my blood pressure dropped from 115/85 to 90/50 when I stood up.

I didn't think anything of it since I'm usually a little anxious, however in the beginning of June I had a massive anxiety attack that I thought was a cardiac event. I was tachycardic (124) and had high blood pressure (152/98 -- high for me, I'm usually 112/62 with a 55-65pulse). This came on suddenly while cooking (I had recently vaped a 5mg Juul) and included a strange change in cognition like that of a dream or the beginning of a psychotropic \"trip\". I sincerely had the sensation that I was dying and could almost hear and see my family mourning me. My wife drove me to the hospital where I got an immediate EKG which showed nothing other than me having a fine heart. The blood work showed no stroke activity or cardiac distress. I was sent home with advice about acid reflux and possible anxiety.\n\nSince then, almost every day or every other day I have been having similar (albeit lesser) events. These are usually accompanied or made worsened by headaches. When they're really bad, I have a hard time saying more than five or six words at once and I have racing, shallow thoughts and the same high anxiety. My heart rate will be somewhere in the 70s or 80s and my blood pressure will be high-normal (140/80) (I'm a Medical Assistant so I can check my VS when I feel like this). These events do not involve hyperglycemia. I've been quitting the Juul since I think that it might be that, but even on the days where I hadn't smoke it I still felt at least some of the symptoms described. When I feel like this, I feel that I have tunnel vision too and can't focus on anything -- I almost feel \"absent\" -- and a little dissociative. Sometimes I have a hard time speaking, will mix words up in sentences (e.g \"I threw the trash in the paper\") or can't think of the words I want to say more than one or two words ahead. My biggest fear is that I have a brain aneurysm or a tumor or something and that sends me into a horrible anxiety pit. I only received a reprieve from this if I'm a few drinks in -- and even then, it's very short. In the mornings, the symptoms don't exist and it's almost as though they just being to onset throughout the day. More recently, my lips will have a slight tingle or pins and needles to them. The weirdest way to describe it is that I feel like I'm just completely unspooling and I feel like a child lost in thought during play.\n\nPlease help! I really feel like I'm dying and it's ruining my quality of life and my personal relationships. All I want to do is sleep because I'm so anxious that I'm dying. I feel like I'm almost becoming schizophrenic. I am going to see my healthcare provider this week, but I would like some insight before then.\n\nThank you."

        "reddit": "I\u2019m a 29F in Canada who has been dealing with sickness for about a month, originally prompted by a bad reaction to and quitting SSRI\u2019s. I stopped eating well as of August 1st and barely left the house until last week, where I made myself get out and walk 50KM over the course of 7 days. I was doing fine and then got very sick four days ago - dizzy, nauseous, very weak, exhausted but unable to sleep, heightened anxiety, palpitations, breathing issues, reflux, no appetite, mild pains, breathing issues (feels like I can\u2019t get enough air). \n\nI got some blood tests done on Friday expecting to hear I had anemia going on but my iron levels were normal and the doctor told me I wasn\u2019t anemic - he said it was allllllll anxiety. I feel miserable enough that I am not convinced it\u2019s JUST anxiety. \n\nToday, I got a follow-up call from the hospital saying I was low in vitamin d and potassium, and that my white blood cell count is slightly high (she said it\u2019s nothing alarming) and that I\u2019m battling some kind of inflammation. She told me I could supplement with 600iu vitamin d and that I should just start eating more bananas for potassium - she didn\u2019t say anything about supplementing for that. \n\nFirst question - do my symptoms line up to these deficiencies?\n\nSecond - 600iu seems like a mild deficiency compared to others to be causing me so much grief...is there something else I should be looking into? Any ideas?\n\nThird - I will be requesting a follow-up blood test from my new GP when I meet her on the 3rd of September, but how long does it normally take to get vitamin d back up to normal? How will I know when to stop taking supplements? I freelance so I don\u2019t get out much, so I\u2019m wondering if I have to supplement forever. \n\nFourth - Unrelated; I got my period two days before my blood tests were ran, and my gums tend to get sore and bleed before and during my period. Any idea if that could be what the inflammation is all about? Or my period for that matter? Just curious if anyone has any thoughts. If not, how do I go about just trying to find the source of random inflammation? What do I ask doctors to investigate? \n\nFIFTH - best way to get potassium without supplementing? Any specific meals or ways to absorb more? \n\nThanks.\n\nEDIT: was told my vitamin D was at \u201c37, and I want to be at 75+\u201d. So nothing super drastic but I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s low enough to make me feel miserable when mixed with Potassium deficiencies too."

( Could this be causing the below side effects?)\nAnd birth control pill\n\nTitle says it all really. But read on for more info...\n I started out on Lexapro 10 mg for anxiety, was on it for 5 or 6 years. It was a godsend without many side effects. \n\nHowever, my therapist started to think it wasn't working as well anymore. I tried for a short while doing 20 mg Lexapro and 5? (Cant remember) mg Buspar morning and night but didn't notice a difference. So I went back to 10 mg before eventually reluctantly switching.\n\nSo I switched to Zoloft about a year ago now. Zoloft is ok. I had been taking 50 mg this past year but my anxiety has increased recently so now I'm doing 100 mg. It definitely works. I do feel calmer and happier and can feel the drug effects.\n\nHOWEVER the side effects I've noticed with Zoloft are very annoying to me. Always have been. And might be enough for me to switch again.\nThese side effects are:\nDry mouth\nPoor appetite\nExcessive thirst (very annoying)\nConstipation/weird irregular digestive issues\nLump in throat feeling, especially after meals or if I don't quench my incessant thirst\n(this is the worst because it makes it difficult to swallow or take deep breaths and it reminds my brain of the similar throat tightening I experience during panic attacks. Doesn't make much sense to take a medication that reminds me of that feeling..)\n\nI hate playing medication roulette because it increases my anxiety in the interim. I will say that zoloft does work very well but the side effects are very frustrating for me. Also, my number one reason I take these medications is to reduce/control panic attacks.\n\nSo, I have a few questions.\n1) Are the side effects I listed above related to Zoloft? Or could it be something else? (Blood tests come back normal though)\n\n2) What is the Lexapro dosage equivalent to Zoloft 100 mg?\n\n3) It's been a year. Can I try Lexapro again (or maybe something similar like Celexa?) Or is poop out forever?"

I have had some heart concerns the past couple weeks, and was hoping to get some immediate suggestions or guidance, as I am not able to see a doctor in my area for another couple of weeks.  \n\nThis started about 3 weeks ago, where throughout the duration of a week, I got around 7-10 notifications from my Apple Watch stating that I had a high resting heart rate. Almost all of these times occurred when I was sitting at work, laying down in bed, basically not exerting much physical energy at all. These readings ranged from 139 being the lowest, to 157 to the highest. The 157 one was particularly concerning for me, as I was simply just sitting at my work desk, playing mahjong. I double checked the reading again, to make sure it wasn't a fluke, but it wasn't, and my heart rate continued to stay there for about 5 minutes before slowly lowering.  \n\nThen, about a week and a half ago, I had a very scary incident, where while I was sitting at home, watching some television, I got a notification from my watch stating that my heart rate was at an alarming 175. I thought, that couldn't be right, but after double checking, it stated the same reading, and was increasing at an alarming rate. I felt extremely light headed, and stumbled to unlock the door after calling an ambulance. My heart rate by the time the ambulance arrived was around 220. After arriving at the hospital, they managed to lower it to around 145-150, but still couldn't really get down.  They performed a bunch of tests on me, pumped me with fluids, and after several hours, my heart rate finally lowered to around 110 at my time of discharge.\n\nAccording to my discharge papers, these are the tests that they ran on me: \n\n* Labs: CBC, CMET, BNP Pro, U Drug Scn, TSH w/RFLX, Lactic Acid, Troponin T, Ethanol, Auto Diff\n* XR Chest Single View\n* 2 ECGs\n\nAfter completing and reviewing all these tests, the ER doc was pretty stumped. He stated that all the labs, X-Rays, and ECGs came back completely normal. No signs of heart disease, nothing. He said he really wasn't sure what caused it, but also made a specific point, after I asked, that he did not believe my GAD caused this. I have pretty bad anxiety, and a history of panic attacks, but after explaining how the situation came about, the doctor stated that while the anxiety could have increased the heart rate, he does not believe it was the base cause, or even a major contributing factor.  \n\nI was officially discharged with the diagnosis of Nonspecific Tachycardia. The doctor said just to watch it, and to return to hospital if I get a steady or increasing reading of 150 or above, but to also make sure I see a PCP in the coming days. \n\nSince then, I have just felt very out of it. I will walk the single flight of stairs to get to my apartment, and my heart rate shoots up to 145-150, and stays there for a couple of minutes. I get somewhat light headed, and have to really sit down to try and get back to 'normal'. Some days are even worse than others. Today for example, a simple walk from my bed to my bathroom jumps my resting heart rate from around 110 to 145-150, and again, stays at that peak for many minutes after. Both of these instances have never happened prior to these past 3 weeks, and it's very concerning to me. I hate the idea that to just walk from my bedroom to my kitchen, I have to take a few minutes of pause to try and get my heart rate to go down.  \n\nHere's where I have my questions. I live in a fairly small town, and I could not get into a PCP physician for weeks. The select few that are up here don't really take walk-ins, and direct you to the local urgent care. On top of that, the only cardiologist in town doesn't accept my insurance for some reason, effectively taking that off the table.  As this has been quite a concern for me as of late, I was hoping to get some ideas as to what may be causing this?? Is there any way I can go see a doctor in my area ASAP without going back to the ER? I would really just appreciate any input, as I didn't get many answers from the hospital, and have continued to have lingering (but less severe) symptoms that are concerning me.\n\nTLDR: Random instances of high resting heart (140ish-160ish) for past month or so. About a week and a half ago got rushed to hospital for resting heart rate that reach 220 with severe dizziness and disorientation. At hospital, many tests performed, left docs stumped. No signs of heart disease, all labs came back clear. Lingering high heart rate since, with simple walks from one room to another jumping my heart rate from 110-145/150. Can't get into doctor for weeks, would like advice."

No evidence of pulmonary emboli.\n\nSome scattered groundglass opacities in the lungs which could reflect areas of air trapping or alveolitis..\n\nUterus is enlarged and heterogeneous with density in the endometrial cavity region and air. Although this may all be related to recent C-section underlying infection/endometritis is not excluded.\n\nAlong the caudal aspect of the uterus is a semilunar collection of fluid and air. This is presumably postoperative. An infectious collection could have this appearance.\n\nModerate amount of infiltration in the subcutaneous fat and rectus abdominis muscles related to recent surgery.\n\nFindings of adynamic ileus.[PB.2] \n\nEKG: [PB.1] Sinus tachycardia, rate of 103.

Cesarean section was about two weeks previously.\n\nTECHNIQUE: CT of the abdomen and pelvis was performed with intravenous contrast. Isovue 370 100 mL was administered intravenously.\n\nAutomated mA/kV exposure control was utilized and patient examination was performed in strict accordance with principles of ALARA.\nCOMPARISON: CTA chest CT abdomen pelvis 6/4/2019, US abdomen 5/28/2019.\n\nFINDINGS:\n\nAbdomen:\n\nThe lung bases are clear. No opaque cholelithiasis. There is hepatomegaly and elongated right lobe of the liver again seen. No focal hepatic lesion. The pancreas, spleen, adrenal glands, and kidneys demonstrate no acute pathology.\n\nThere is again a small amount of perihepatic fluid. Small amount of perisplenic fluid is now seen. There is now a small amount of fluid in the left anterior pararenal space. Focal fluid in hepatorenal region is now seen although it is not well defined.\n\nThere is no lymph node enlargement. Abdominal aorta is not aneurysmal. The imaging was performed with delayed timing. Ovarian veins are not optimally evaluated for thrombosis, although no definitive area is suspicious for thrombosis.\n\nPelvis:\n\nThere is increase in stranding in the mesentery diffusely and small bowel now appears mildly dilated. There are air-fluid levels in small bowel now seen. There is no definitive transition zone. There is relative underdistention of the terminal ileum. There is suggestion of mucosal thickening of the ascending colon and also of the splenic flexure region and descending colon raising the possibility of colitis. Small amount of contrast remains in the cecum. The appendix is not well localized but its median visible extending medially from the cecum. There is no inflammatory process about this suspected appendix.\n\nSmall fat-containing umbilical hernia. Lymph nodes are not enlarged.\n\nThere is now a rim-enhanced collection in the cul-de-sac approximating 4.8 x 4.6 x 5.2 cm. This could represent abscess. This does not contain gas.\n\nThe uterus remains enlarged but is smaller than on the previous study consistent with expected postpartum involution. There is increase in the amount of gas and complex appearance of the endometrium compared with the previous study. Near resolution of now very tiny bladder flap presumed hematoma slice 61 series 602B. Tiny amount of gas in the anterior wall of the lower uterine segment in the region of incision. Small amount of secretion and gas in the vagina. No adnexal masses are seen.\n\nUnder distended urinary bladder. There is contrast in the proximal right ureter. No contrast in the left ureter.\n\nPostpartum rectus diastasis, and the rectus muscles are slightly prominent suggesting postpartum rectus hematoma but there is no focal rectuscollection.\n\nBy history, a wound VAC is in place but it has not been functioning.\n\nThere is an air and fluid-containing collection in the subcutaneous soft tissues in the region of the cesarean section incision now seen, measuring 3.8 cm in approximate length by up to 13.9 cm transverse and 3.2 cm in AP dimension, concerning for an abscess. Additional 1.8 x 0.8 cm collection on the right just superior to the main incision.\n\nSkeleton:\n\nThere are no acute fractures. No suspicious bony lesions. Osteitis condensans ilii with vacuum phenomenon. Postpartum diastases of the pubic symphysis.\n\nImpression:\n\nIMPRESSION:\n\nStatus post cesarean section with increased gas and increasing complexity of the endometrial canal, raising the possibility of endometritis. Small amount of gas is seen in the vaginal vault within secretion. The uterus is decreasing in size consistent with normal postpartum involution. The small bladder flap collection seen previously is only minimal on the current study, such as slice 62 of series 602B. Tiny amount of gas is seen in the lower uterine segment incision.\n\nThere is now a collection consistent with subcutaneous abscess in the region of the ventral abdominal incision. Apparently the patient has a wound VAC which has not been draining. Redemonstration of prominence of the rectus muscles inferiorly suggesting postpartum mild hematoma, with no focal rectus collection. Postpartum rectus diastases and postpartum pubic symphysis diastases.\n\nThere is now dilated small bowel with air-fluid levels. Possible mucosal thickening of the terminal ileum, which is under distended. No well-defined transition zone to suggest bowel obstruction. There is mucosal thickening of the colon. Perisplenic and small amount of fluid in the left anterior pararenal space is now seen and there is a rim-enhanced cul-de-sac collection. Appearance raises the possibility of enteritis and colitis most likely of infectious etiology. The cul-de-sac collection in particular may represent abscess. The fluid in the left anterior pararenal space does not clearly rim enhance but may represent early abscess. Now noted is small amount of ill-defined focal fluid in the hepatorenal region. There is no pneumoperitoneum or extraluminal gas within the peritoneum. Clinical correlation is needed. Recommend follow-up CT if possible with oral contrast and intravenous contrast, in the proper clinical timeframe, particularly if the patient's symptoms worsen.\n\nIt should be noted that the study was enhanced but the enhancement is captured in a delayed phase. The ovarian veins are not well seen,although there are no definitive findings to suggest ovarian vein thrombosis.\n\nNOTIFICATION: The critical results of the study were discussed with, and acknowledged by\n\n\n****\n\n\nHere is also an X-Ray taken 6/10/19:\n\nTECHNIQUE: Frontal chest was obtained at 19:46 hours.\n\nCOMPARISON: 09/18/17 XR Chest.\n\nFINDINGS:\n\nThe cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal in size.

Symptoms  are severe anxiety, migraines, heart palpitations, extreme fatigue, dry mouth, blurry vision, frequent urination. \n\n\nI started having panic attacks that I\u2019ve never experience before and it became more and more severe until I was waking up in the night with panic attacks. My behavior started to change and I became so sensitized to everything I became afraid to eat and lost a lot of weight. I couldn\u2019t leave my house and I\u2019d lie in bed in a stare of suffering. I wasn\u2019t able to sit comfortably I had heart palpitations. I felt I was dying or losing all grip and would surely die. I then had blurry vision and saw halos around everything. Eventually that sort of went away. \n\nI had a CT scan of my brain and several EKGs all normal. Blood work showed a positive ANA test that they were not concerned about, and a low TSH (they retested and It came back normal the second time) test showed high blood sugar in a few cases and my urine had ketones but the doctor attributed it to eating and not eating.\n\nI don\u2019t know where to go from here. I don\u2019t know if more lexapro would help it seemed to make the anxiety worse for the first couple of weeks I begin taking it. It\u2019s a little better now."

I am getting kind of desperate for answers on this.\n\nI am 34 year old male, about 185 pounds for context. I don\u2019t smoke, but do drink alcohol which I should probably cut back on (about 4 times a week). Back in January of this year I had my parents drive me to the ER because it felt like my heart was beating through my chest. As I was walking my dog I felt a tingle go down the left side of my body and I went in to panic mode, I could then feel my heart absolutely racing and I could not do anything to slow it down. Fast forward to the ER I checked in with a heart rate over 150, but thankfully I was not having heart attack like I thought I was. They did a chest X-ray and whatever other typical tests they do for an ER visit and found nothing except a slightly decreased potassium level. Earlier in the day I did have a large cup of coffee, and an energy drink a couple hours after, and a couple of beers. I know that was stupid. So they sent me home and said this was due to all of the caffeine I had that day along with the decreased potassium level.\n\nI decided to quit drinking alcohol and coffee cold turkey at the time, but I just did not feel right for months after while I did this. I would feel occasionally light headed, foggy, got some shortness of breath, would get recurring burping spells, got what I thought were heart palpitations (halter monitor I later wore didn\u2019t show any), my hands would feel colder than usual on occasion, and I was just kind of always afraid I was going to drop dead of a heart attack. I kept googling and looking for answers while I waited to see a cardiologist and came across a post of someone who said they had similar symptoms from caffeine withdrawal (I have always been a pretty big caffeine drinker, about 3 cups of coffee a day). So I decided to ease my way back in to caffeine and pretty much all of the symptoms went away when I did\u2026 except the burping.\n\nSo I went to a cardiologist and got an echo-cardiogram, I wore a halter monitor for 48 hours, and got a stress test on a treadmill. All the results came back perfectly normal. My cardiologist called to ensure me that I have a very strong heart (she knew I was kind of a wreck at this point so it was nice she used those words to describe the results to comfort me). My blood pressure is slightly elevated, but not to the point of medication but because of that I always get anxious about heart things. I also have a touch of white coat syndrome in that I absolutely hate getting my blood pressure taken by someone, I can\u2019t really explain that. Anyway I kind of chalked the burping up to anxiety thanks to google, and the previous symptoms up to caffeine withdrawal and went on about my life. But one thing that hasn\u2019t gone away is the burping. It comes and goes, some days I will feel mostly normal, then all of a sudden I will have a full on burp attack. Like it is not just a couple of burps, I am burping hardcore for 15 minutes straight sometimes. And I feel like I have to burp every other breath. I have to do the thing where I force myself to burp because it feels like I absolutely have to let that air out of my chest. I can\u2019t take a deep breath until after I let out one of these long burps. Letting the air out with a big burp feels temporarily so good, but it builds back up in the next couple of breaths and out come more burps. Eventually they do subside, but while it is happening I put myself in to almost a full blown panic attack. I once read somewhere burping can be a sign that you are having a heart attack so I just always assume this is something with my heart when it starts.  But since my cardiologist said I was fine, I then decided to go to a gastro. I now kind of thought that I either had GERD or perhaps worst case stomach cancer. They performed an upper endoscopy and found nothing except \u201cslight acid reflux\u201d. She said very minimal. So there is no way that explains the intensity of the burping I am getting. \n\nDoes anyone have any idea what this is a symptom of? I google excessive burping and heart, and angina pectoris comes up. Could I have that? Would the echocardio/chest xray/stress test/halter monitor have caught that? If not, how do I test for that? Is it just anxiety? Could it be a stomach issue the endoscopy did not catch? I am not expecting answers to all of these questions, that\u2019s just kind of my stream of consciousness always present worries. But since this all started in the immediate aftermath of my ER visit for a spiked heart rate I am just assuming this has something to do with that, but I guess it\u2019s a possibility this is independent of that. It just doesn\u2019t seem likely to me. I don\u2019t even know who to ask anymore, none of my doctors seem concerned (my primary, gastro, or my cardiologist) which I guess is a little comforting, but I am extremely concerned. It just does not feel normal. It\u2019s driving me crazy and when it happens it is honestly very scary. If anyone could give me any insight on maybe tests to ask for, or if you have come across anything like this before I would be hugely appreciative of any information I can get. Sorry for the wall of text!\n\n**TLDR**: I have been getting hardcore excessive burping attacks since January when I was admitted to the ER for a spiked heart rate that was kicked off by excessive caffeine consumption coupled with alcohol. Cardiologist said I\u2019m fine, Gastro said I\u2019m fine, Primary said I\u2019m fine, but I never had these attacks before that issue and they are now driving me insane. Could I have a heart issue my cardio did not catch? Angina pectoris? What else could this be? Are there any tests I should ask for outside of what I have already had (Chest x-ray, echo cardiogram, treadmill stress test, 48 hour halter monitor, upper endoscopy). I am really desperate for answers so any and all input is really appreciated. Thank you!!"

Recent (&lt;5yr) worsening of headache, additional problems with sight, balance, and memory. Seizure episodes, daily and then some, sometimes as severe as total sensory loss and lost time, but usually much less severe.\n\nThey've told me the incision will start in front of my left ear and go almost all the way up to the top of my skull. They'll remove some bone, maybe roughly the circumference of a golf ball or slightly larger, then remove a cone of healthy brain tissue to access the location of the tumor and remove it. The tumor appears to me, in the MRI, to be clusters in the shape of a long, thin leaf, like a walnut leaf, pointing up and back and ending in a point very close to the primary blood vessels in the center of my brain. I was told that a blood vessel on the hippocampus itself is adjacent to the mass.\n\nWhen they're done, they put the bone back. At some point, potentialy but maybe not during the surgery, they will get a new MRI to double check their work.\n\nI'll be spending time in the ICU and no fewer than 4 nights in the hospital. I was told to expect a worsening of some of my symptoms for awhile, maybe around two weeks before I start to feel \"better\".\n\nI'm really just here about that recovery. I trust the doctors and staff and feel that I understand the fundamentals of what's happening (although I might be fudging these details just slightly). But there are obviously a lot of details that I won't learn until I come to them. The stuff that happens while I'm unconscious is only relevant to this discussion if there's a related symptom during the recovery. I just want to know if there's anything that I can prepare for, even just mentally prepare for, when I'm on the other side.\n\nI'd really only like answers from doctors who have had patients recovering from brain surgeries, or access to other accounts. Might be a limited set, but I'd rather have firsthand, proven stuff rather than general knowledge or word of mouth."

This has been a struggle that I have had to deal with and now I really just wish I would stop getting them because at the moment, they\u2019re very frequent. \n\nEvery time I have a UTI or believe that I have the risk of getting them, I try every natural remedy in the book: Staying hydrated, urinating when I need to, drinking cranberry juice, taking cranberry juice supplements, eating probiotics such as yoghurts, making sure I get more vitamin C, practicing the best sexual hygiene I can, etc. I even try to do all of these things even if I\u2019m okay just to be sure... But now, none of that seems to be effective.\n\nMy latest UTI battle (which is still ongoing now) was when I lost my virginity and became sexually active around 2 months ago. I am on the Nexplanon implant, meaning that I can have sex with my boyfriend without a condom, which has been a lot better for both of us as we find it a lot more comfortable. All was well and good until I got honeymoon cystitis or \u201choneymoon disease\u201d as they like to nickname it. I went to the doctors straight away after I was in excruciating pain, and was given a week\u2019s course of Nitrofurantoin. \n\nI had taken Nitrofurantoin before for a previous UTI unrelated to sex a fair few months back, so I was familiar with this drug. I was told to refrain from sexual intercourse for the week and then practice good sexual hygiene (or at least the best I could) i.e. urinating before and after, washing/wiping the genitals before and after, etc. So I did, and not long after, I got it again. It wasn\u2019t anywhere near as bad the second time, but I was getting similar symptoms as before. This time, I was given a week\u2019s worth of Macrobid, which seemed to clear up the infection a lot quicker. I was told the exact same thing as before, and did as I was told yet again...\n\nBut then my boyfriend and I had sex again last night and despite being as careful as possible and doing everything that I was told to do... Here I am typing this whilst sitting on the toilet and thinking, \u201cWhy me?!\u201d I feel so embarrassed about having the same infection for a 3rd time after following all of the instructions religiously TWICE as well as taking professional medical advice. I don\u2019t know whether to go back to the doctors or wait this one out to see if it goes away. I\u2019m hoping it\u2019s just \u201cone of those things\u201d but I doubt that it will go away on its own. This post is definitely a cry for help, because I\u2019m out of options. \n\nThank you for taking the time to read this x"

Prior to leaving work at noon this last Friday, I had noticed my heart felt a little strange here and there, but I just blamed it on the caffeine. After work I golfed with some coworkers in the heat and felt fine until I got home and noticed there was now a constant pressure in my left chest. After gatorade and a cold shower I felt fine. The next day I went to a concert and while driving there the pressure came back. I could feel some tingling and slight numbness in my left pinky and ring finger but after stretching my arm it would go away. This happened a few times. During the show I started feeling a little dizzy and began to sweat. I asked my fiance if she was sweating and she said no, but she could see that I was. I had researched symptoms of a heart attack prior to this and immediately went to find an EMT. She sat me down and ran some tests, saying that my blood pressure and heart rate were fine (55-50,  lower, due to bradycardia). She recommended I follow up with a doctor. After getting a water and going back to the show I felt fine and slept it off. Today it was a bit more mild but still present after a few hours of being awake. I took some alka seltzer, pepto bismol, and a tums pill to rule out indigestion, and the alka seltzer seemed to alleviate the pain for a while. But it seems stronger now and I'm debating about what I should do next.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDo you think I pulled something weird playing golf?

My knees also cramp up a lot and sometimes give out if I walk up or downstairs and I will fall over. \n\ncomplaint 2: I have acne like every other teen but no matter what I do to it, they always scar up even when I don't pick at them. Usually not picking at them makes them worse and has lead to a cyst that has to be removed on my cheek as well as 2 in my right earlobe. I also get some pimples in weird spots like my arms.

        "reddit": "23 years old. Female. 5,7 tall. 148 lbs. Caucasian. For the last month I've been having pain around my belly button and my lower back. The pain in my lower back radiates to my buttocks. For years I've been feeling a strong pulse around my belly button and when I lay down I can see my abdomen pulsating. But recently I've noticed a lump growing on the right side of my belly button (I attached 2 pics). Also, for years I've been having severe blotaing after eating and constipation. Two years ago I told my gastroenterologist that I could feel my pulse in my abdomen and she advised me to get an ultrasound. When I went to get the ultrasound done, the doctor rushed through the appointment saying it was impossible that I could have an abdominal anueyrsm, making me feel like it was all in my head. He checked me with the ultrasound machine for like a minute and said everything was fine and that I did not have any visceral or vascular issues. But now, with the pain and the lump growing I'm thinking that maybe he missed the anuerysm (is it hard to miss an aneurysm doing an ultrasound?). I've read it's uncommon for young people to have anuerysms... But if it's not an aneurysm, what could it be? Umbilical hernia? A cyst? I don't know, I'm thinking about getting an appointment with my doctor, but I don't want to be treated again like I'm crazy and like it's all in my head. \n\nLump in the abdomen:\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/jjqgSPo](https://imgur.com/a/jjqgSPo)"

Almost a year back on two separate occasions, I had a mix of protected and unprotected sex with a woman I had met in a heat of the moment type of thing. She claims to get tested regularly, and even up to about a month ago when I last had contact with her she said she was uninfected with any STI. \n\nHowever, about 73 days after our encounter, my chronic anxiety (which I am now treating through supplements, rather successfully might I add!) was bugging me and I slapped myself on the head for not using a condom for the encounter. So I hopped down to the local pharmacy and picked up an Oraquick oral swab test. I read the box, which said there is a 3 month window period, and in my haste I figured that it was close enough and followed the instructions dutifully. Result: negative.\n\nNow I\u2019ve only had (protected) sex once with a new partner since then, took a bit of a break and now I\u2019m back on the dating scene. I wanted to be responsible however, and just check up on the accuracy of these results, considering the whole 3 month window period. One doctor told me it was definitively conclusive despite the 3 month advised period, while another gave me a talk about how at 4 weeks, 95% of people would have detectable antibodies, and by week 10 nearly 99% or more individuals would test accurately positive or negative, depending on their status, and once again would consider this conclusive as only a week and a few days wouldn\u2019t make any difference. My question to you is, is this information accurate. I never displayed symptoms of seroconversion, and other than allergies and a bout of dishydrosis since I\u2019ve been home within the last two months (damn you foot irritants/allergens!) I\u2019ve been completely healthy!"

So last week we had a nice family holiday but the first 4 nights I couldn\u2019t sleep at all. I think (guess) I averaged about 4 hours per night. I fairly often to struggle to sleep but that\u2019s once maybe twice max in a row so this was different. Anyway, since then I had three days of ok sleep (although the bed was awful) but the last day I felt so fatigued I was ready to go to sleep at 5pm. That night I was in bed and a horrendous headache came on which bothered me all night. I woke up in the morning with aches in my neck back shoulders and head. Colt and hot sweats and my skin felt very sensitive. Took painkillers and got on the flight home. Felt ok at best. Got home and it went back to feeling awful again. Same symptoms. Stayed in bed all day and got an early night. At night the headaches came again. Yesterday felt pretty lame all day but no shivers or sensitive skin but still the aches. Went to be and bang, the headaches come again really bad. Woke up today feeling dreadful again. \n\nCould this be flu?\n\nA little thing I just realised - once when I was in France with work I had three nights of struggling to sleep then was ill like this for a couple of days. Maybe it\u2019s the no sleep making me ill? Or the illness effects my sleep before I get other symptoms?\n\nAny advice much appreciated. I\u2019m just testing drinking lots of water"

I\u2019ve also never really explained this to anyone but my girlfriend so I apologize for not explaining it well. I have never heard of anything like this other than experiencing it for myself. I\u2019ve spent countless hours on the internet looking for answers but always ended up empty handed. I have no idea how this affects my body. I am just looking to see if anyone else has experienced this or know someone who has. And because of anxiety I\u2019m now worried something is seriously wrong with me and I\u2019ve ignored it for too long. \n\nNow like the title says, for the last 11 years I have been doing this thing where I hold my breath for about maybe 7-12 seconds multiple times a day. And when I say multiple I mean Multiple times every hour of every day since I was 8. I also don\u2019t just mean that I hold my breath loosely every now and then. It\u2019s like my body automatically deeply inhales, like until my lungs feel quite full. As I\u2019m holding my breathe I get this feeling I can\u2019t quite explain, almost like a euphoric pleasure that spreads from my chest to my head. I exhale and the whole cycle repeats every few minutes or so. A lot of the time I don\u2019t even know I\u2019m doing it, I have just been automatically doing it for years and not paying any attention to it. \n\nAll of this started when I was eight years old, right around the time I received a high cholesterol diagnoses (yes I was an eight year old with high cholesterol, the story behind it is unbelievable and quite embarrassing). I don\u2019t remember anything other than receiving my diagnoses and having to make lifestyle changes to help my case. I have not suffered from Hugh cholesterol since. My entire family also knows about my breath holding and rather than a problem it\u2019s just because a normal thing/joke for me, to most it\u2019s my defining characteristic. It\u2019s also very noticeable when I am holding my breathe from my extended chest. I have people ask all the time if I\u2019m okay and rather than explain I just say it\u2019s an anxiety thing, but it\u2019s really not.  If I had to say, it\u2019s almost like an addiction, because if I force myself to stop my lungs start to ache, like I need to hold my breathe. I have tried everything to stop but it\u2019s just a part of me now. \n\nThat\u2019s it for the most part, some parts may be jumbled or confusing but I\u2019d be happy to clarify any questions. And I\u2019m not really looking for a diagnosis on this, just seeing if anyone can relate."

Asthma 2.More or less undiagnosed heart condition. At the least, I know I have a mitral valve prolapse. However I have had irregular EKGs (showing arrythmias) for a couple years now. I used to have a resting heart rate of around 150, but I take medication that helps slow it down. This same medication inconsequently also lowers my already low blood pressure, so I often have quite low blood pressure as well (50/80 is typical). My GP has been wanting to get me in for an echo for a while now, but due to losing my insurance this hadn't been possible, which is why I say undiagnosed heart condition since my doctor has expressed something doesn't seem right. \n\nCurrent Medications: Metoprolol (100mg?) once a day, Ambien (10mg) as needed at night. \n\n\n\nI'd like to start this out by saying I don't have a history of anxiety or panic attacks. Even when I had a very high heart rate, that's what felt normal to me and therefore didn't cause anxiety. I had an uneventful day, although I've worked very long hours the past two days so I'm a bit exhausted. A couple hours ago I was just browsing Reddit and watching TV, relaxing, when I suddenly felt an intense fear come over me. I could barely breathe, my vision went blurry, and I felt like I would turn my head and see someone standing behind me. Nobody's there, but this feeling won't go away. I have blind spots in my vision and I go to stand up and nearly throw up, so I sit back down. Literally sick with fear, I try to wake my boyfriend up. I try to express whats going on, he gets me my inhaler and talks me down a bit before falling back asleep. I feel a little better, but am visibly shaking with chills (shivering) for a while before it goes away. \n\nBut only for about 20-30 minutes. I go from being completely fine again, to having this super intense fear. This time while it happens I was walking up the stairs, and my legs literally gave out, so i dropped down on the step, and promptly threw up. Once again I'm shaking, and feel like I'm going to turn around and see someone standing behind me. \n\nMy last \"attack\" was almost a half hour ago now. I'm debating whether I should go get help. Part of me feels like this would be written off as a panic attack, I've never experienced one and don't know what they feel like...maybe it is one, I dont know? But it wasn't gradual, it was super and sudden and came from nowhere while I was relaxing. Part of me worries something might actually be wrong. And a tiny part of me is feeling supernatural about it, and is making me want to call my family members and make sure they are okay. I know that's a stupid theory, but I just don't know if this should be taken as a medical problem  and that's why I'm asking here. As I mentioned, I don't have insurance and can't afford to go to a hospital for a possible anxiety attack. \n\nBut something just doesn't feel right."

It's still a few months away. I did my best to schedule it on a week where I *wouldn't* be menstruating. Unfortunately, my period seems to be doing whatever the hell it pleases, &amp; has arrived early this month, throwing off my future calculations for my surgery date.  \n&amp;nbsp;   \nI know it's not a 'major' thing - doctors deal with far more vile things than menstrual blood, but that knowledge doesn't turn down the gross/anxiety/shame factor for me, as I'm a neurotic weirdo when it comes to always being 'clean' down there. I have some residual body shame issues in general that are typically kept well in-check these days, but this is certainly turning up  the volume on that by quite a bit.   \n&amp;nbsp;  \n&amp;nbsp;  \nI looked around online, &amp; I keep seeing things that say I can't wear a tampon during surgery. Is that true? Everything I've read about menstruating during surgery [in general, not specifically about hip surgery] just basically says, 'they'll slap a pad on you, don't worry.' Well- I'm worried. I always feel filthy if I'm stuck laying down w/a pad. I wake up with menstrual fluids going up my butt crack - it's even made its way to my lower back before... it's always a disgusting mess. And apparently I can't shower for a few days after surgery.  And how exactly would 'slapping a pad on' work when you're pretty much naked for hip arthroscopy, anyway? Pads don't stay in place without underwear. Or would they just forego pads &amp; just let me leak all over the place/onto a disposable mat-thing on the operating table?  My boyfriend will be helping me after surgery... I really don't want him helping me wipe menstrual blood off me when I get home from the hospital that day. I've never let my boyfriend be even remotely that intimate when I'm menstruating because of how gross that is to me\n\n&amp;nbsp;  \n&amp;nbsp;  \nFrom what I understand, hip arthroscopy only takes 1-2 hours.. that's well within a 'safe' time frame between tampon changes. I'm just really hoping I can wear a tampon for the procedure itself, but nothing I've found has said that would be allowable. Please tell me that's not the case. I mean, I sleep w/one in whenever I have my period, &amp; that's 8hrs. Never had any TSS issue. Is that why they wouldn't be allowed?  I haven't asked the surgeon about it, yet. While I rationally understand it's just another bodily function, I'm still really, really mortified about it in this context, for a number of reasons. Even if it does sound incredibly juvenile (hell, I'm not even anxious about the surgical procedure itself), it's still causing me a lot of stress."

The first one I remember happened when I was pretty young, the next one probably when I was in middle school. They\u2019ve always been pretty spaced out, so I figured they were nothing to worry about. When I was 16, I had an episode where I passed out twice in maybe ten minutes (at church of all places). \n\nIt started to change when I was 18.

After I fully came to, I was told I\u2019d been \u201cunconscious\u201d for almost two minutes, except I wasn\u2019t really unconscious. \n\nI got referred to a local cardiologist, who did an EEG. He said it came back normal, diagnosed me with chronic hypotension, and told me to stop smoking weed. He also referred me to a neurologist, who did an MRI or CAT scan (I can\u2019t remember), which was also normal &amp; they decided hypotension must be right. I was prescribed some kind of heart medication, but I never refilled the script because I felt fine. \n\nAt 21 I was working as a CNA. During a shift one day, I realized I was about to pass out. Normal tunnel vision, loss of hearing, chills, &amp; fatigue. I sat down and told my nurse. She hooked me up to our vitals machine and immediately called for the nurse on the next hall. My BP was about 50/40 and my pulse was 48. I can\u2019t remember my respirations or oxygen rate. I remember my temp being low as well. I didn\u2019t pass out but I felt the worst I ever have in my life, I thought I was about to die. I was never disoriented but I couldn\u2019t get words out even though I was trying to speak. \n\nI\u2019ve been uninsured since my visit to the cardiologist &amp; cant afford it right now.

She reassured me that as far as the ultrasound goes they have benign characteristics, but since this is the first breast exam and the first ultrasound I have it would be better to either repeat it shortly to check for growth or do a needle biopsy of at least one of the nodules, since there are many of them, all similar. Then, if all is well as it seems, I\u2019ll repeat the ultrasound yearly.\n\nI chose the biopsy and now I\u2019m waiting to be called to perform it and I\u2019m experiencing some anxiety, how likely is it that this is benign as it seemed from the ultrasound?\n\nAlso, should I consider changing birth control method? I read that dense breasts and the pill may not be a good mix. I don't want to needlessly increase cancer risks.\n\nLast but not least: I have no close familiarity of breast cancer. There is however a cousin of my mother who had ovarian cancer, is this relevant for familiarity?\n\nI know that only the exam itself will give me an answer, but I\u2019d like some opinions while I wait because I'm finding myself worrying about it way too much.\nThank you for your time."

Still hurting today.\n\n**Location on body:** All along the inner edge of my right shoulder blade and straight through my chest. Also sometimes hurts closer to the neck.  \n\n**Any diagnosed medical issues:** Suspected fibromyalgia, anxiety/depression, also currently dealing with a right hip issue that has yet to be diagnosed.\n\n**Current medications and doses:** Nortriptyline - 20mg at night, Lorazepam - .5mg as needed (usually once a week at bedtime). ER also gave me 50mg Tramadol which I have been taking 2x a day since Saturday and cyclobenzaprine (I don't know the dosage) which I am only taking before bed because it makes me loopy.  \n\n**Any recreational drugs, smoking status:** No drugs, don't smoke.\n\nSo last Tuesday my husband and I started up DDP Yoga again. (I've been having terrible hip/low back issues for 6 months and my doctor finally cleared me for things like yoga and pilates again). We went really easy on the first round, doing mostly modified poses to work our way back into it. My shoulder was tight/sore the next day, but nothing out of the ordinary for an upper body workout for me. (I also have chronic issues with tender points all around my shoulder blades, so I wasn't concerned)\n\nThen Friday night things got way, way worse. I started having a stabbing pain through my shoulder and into the front of my chest. I couldn't sit or lie down without terrible pain (bordering on a 7 using [this pain scale](https://i.redd.it/kx959lmcozy11.jpg)), couldn't move my neck or shoulders without pain, and it hurt to breathe (I COULD breathe, it was just painful) so my husband took me to the ER. They did some xrays of my shoulder and cervical spine and said they didn't see anything out of the ordinary.\n\nThe tramadol and cyclobenzaprine barely touched the pain but was enough that I managed to get more sleep. By yesterday (Sunday) the pain was down to maybe a 5, but any time I moved my shoulders in a certain way or turned my head I'd get a stabbing pain right through my back/shoulder and into my chest. It also hurt in the same spot every time I swallowed food. (This is the part that really confuses me.)\n\nPain was really bad this morning coupled with a TERRIBLE tension headache. \n\nI'm assuming the issue is pinched nerve or something...but where? And could swallowing irritate a nerve enough that it sends pain shooting through my back and chest? \n\nCould it be a herniated disc in my thoracic spine? (I know those are a lot more difficult to herniate but idk, I'm physically a mess so I wouldn't be surprised.)\n\nAnd how long do I give it before scheduling an appointment with someone like an orthopedist or physiatrist? (I have an appointment with one in a week and a half for the hip issue but they have said they will not address two issues in one visit...so yeah.)"

She's had several steroid injections in her ribs/ spine in various places, which have not helped. She says the pain is not just her ribs, but goes deeper.  She can also feel something on her right bottom rib that is different from the left, she gets pain in both side but the right is far worse. \n\nInterestingly, during her 3 pregnancies, this has eased to the point where she has not needed daily painkillers and was able to lead a normal life. It started after the first pregnancy, and returned after giving birth with her subsequent children. She was told losing weight would help any pain issues she was having, but after having lost 6 stone, is actually in a lot more pain. \n\nThis is the symptom that interests me, why did pregnancy help it so much? And why has weight loss made it worse? I feel the doctors are not even asking that question, they've dismissed me when I tried asking it. \n\nDoes this ring any bells for any specialists out there?

I contacted my insurance and called over 20 endocrinologists in my area (I live in northern RI) and have been trying to call endocrinologists on the Providence/Stoughton commuter rail line because I don't have a car.

Has depression, no thyroid due to previous cancer, and is currently having heart issues. Current medications she's on are Levoxyl (name brand, not generic levothyroxine), duloxetine, and abilify.\n\n\\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nQuite specific here and going on a longshot, but I'm willing to do anything to help my wife. My wife's been in and out of local ER's 6 times now in the past 2 months, has blood pressure swings from normal to high, or normal to low. Prior to these past 2-3 months this hasn't ever happened. She's gotten nauseous, light headed, and fainted a handful of times too, always waking up within seconds. In the ER her heart rate has always been between 90-140bpm resting which is obviously quite high for someone laying down and not moving.\n\nI got her an apple watch series 4 to measure her ECG and heart rate hoping it'd provide some answers and help us monitor her heart closer when she's not feeling well. When she starts feeling weak and light headed, we've noticed her Apple watch is reporting a heart rate of 110-140, so it's quite high.\n\nShe's on the antidepressants Duloxetine and Abilify (on both for roughly 2 years now), which her family doctor told us may be causing reactions with one another as a fast heart rate and blood pressure changes are clearly listed side effects of the drug Abilify. Her advised she not take Abilify for one week to see it it helps, but we're 9 days in without it and she's still not feeling much better as far as her heart rate goes. If anything, it's causing her to have some mood swings and such as typical of coming off an antidepressant.\n\nHave you ever seen this in other patients? One doctor in the ER diagnosed her with inappropriate sinus tachycardia, but nothing came from that visit otherwise. They put her on the medication Corlanor which was helpful for the first week (it got her heart rate to 60-70bpm resting which is normal), but not so much afterwards since it's effectiveness wore off.\n\nReally don't want to go to the ER again when all they want to do is stabilize her and push her back out the door. We saw a new cardiologist today who was highly recommended and we waited over 2 months to get into, to only be told it's out of his range of expertise. \n\nCould it truly just be a simple case of meds reacting with one another? Why would she have reactions to a drug 2 years after taking it, and never before? Could thyroid medication somehow cause this if her TSH levels are off? Could this be something else? ECG, EKG all look normal in every ER we've been to."

My eyes hurt from how dry they, they burn, feel SUPER tired and do not let me do anything which requires focusing/concentrating. Because of it, I graduated late from college because I had to take semester breaks and I haven't been been able to hold a full time job because they bother me to that extent. I'm also very sensitive to light. I saw 3 optometrists so far and the first one just said to use artificial eye drops which for years haven't helped. The second one convinced me punctual plugs would help so I got them and they did nothing. The 3rd one detected inflammation and allergies (though not sure how the other 2 missed this) so she put me on Alrex steroid drops. I could not believe the relief I got from this - I was in tears from happiness. She only had me take them for a week and then switched me over to anti-histamine drops which are not working and if anything are making my eyes more irritated. The clinic is now recommending I go back on the steroid drops for 4 more weeks and tapering off gradually. But, they said this will not get rid of the inflammation/allergy so essentially once I stop them, my symptoms will come back. So what's the point exactly of taking the steroid drops if it's just for temporary relief?\n\nCould I possibly have MGD? I asked the last doctor to check for this and she kept brushing it off. I suspect I do because the artificial tear drops and punctal plugs didn't help so that tells me the issue might not be with the tears but rather the oil glands? I also suspect this because I took accutane (isotretinoin) as a teenager and it's been known to cause this. \n\nWhat does it mean that the steroid drops helped? Did they help with inflammation? with MGD?\n\nDo steroid eyedrops get into your system/blood? because I'm not sure if it's a coincidence or not but 2 days after starting the drops I started having anxiety attacks which I never had in my life. After stopping them, it took a week for the anxiety to go away."

Over the past week, I noticed the primary symptom of more urination - but I do drink about 700ml every 3 hours (3-4L a day of fluids) since its good for my skin, plus I have been trying to drink more water the last week anyways due to the health scare so maybe that's all there is to it. To add, I have been beyond stressed/panicked about these results which I know can mess with your bodies systems so I really just want to get down to the numbers with another test. Additionally, I have cold hands and feet, bruise easily, and my parents told me there is a history of diabetes on my mother's dad's side, they didn't know if type 1 or 2 though. No one in my family currently has it except my aunt who is overweight and arguable unhealthy + her age so I imagine it likely not type 1.\n\nI went to my doctor today assuming he would share similar concerns especially once I shared I was urinating slightly more this past week and of the history but he literally sat there and told me I was perfectly healthy (at first I thought he was going to tell me the results got mixed up or something), he insisted that the healthy-range numbers from that lab were wrong/for fasting glucose and I should only be concerned if my results were at or above 11.1mmol/L which would indicate diabetes. I agreed that it would indicate diabetes but my current concern is prediabetes/early stages of type 1 and he disregarded me completely; telling me he is the doctor and I should only listen to him and then literally quizzed me on what HbA1C was.\nNote: His reference was this: https://guidelines.diabetes.ca/cpg/chapter3 Table 3; however I stated that table is for diabetic diagnosis and my concern is prediabetes - he continues to dismiss and argue with me. After getting home, I found it and saw table 5 in the SAME reference he used which is for prediabetics and it does line up more closely with my results/my findings online, only issue being my meal was consumed 30 minutes before my test rather than 2 hours. I should add Table 5 lines up with the lab reference since they say a healthy fasting serum glucose is between 3.6-6.0 mmol/L, and prediabetes is from 6.1-6.mmol/L according to Table 5.\n\nI stated I was beyond stressed and worried that there is something wrong. With a \"screw you\" type of attitude, he ordered a blood test for fasting glucose and hba1c. And proceeded to say, don't make an appointment, I will call you if there is a concern, which means if it fits his Table 3. I should add the blood test results literally said on it that it is recommended the doctor follow up with at least a fasting glucose test which he dismissed as the lab is wrong. Like how can an entire standard follow by two large provinces THAT WE LIVE IN be wrong?\n\nSorry for the length, I am just worried and upset my doctor dismissed my concern and beyond that didn't seem to care what the lab reference said even though HE ordered my blood test because I worried my vegetarian diet might have been causing deficiency such as iron or whatever. I have university coming up and have read enough stories on Reddit with type 1 diabetics waiting too long to be diagnosed, I want to get ahead of any possible issues.\n\nThanks for reading, any advice on how I should deal with my doctor/this situation is helpful."

I was hoping that someone on here might be able to help or at least shed some light on what might be going wrong.  \n\n\nAbout 8 months ago, I was out on a run when I noticed I felt a little dizzy.  I was in college and applying to grad programs at that time so I was having a lot of anxiety, so I figured I was just overthinking it and making a big deal out of nothing.  \n\nI went home, showered, watched a movie, and noticed that the dizziness was still pretty much there.   I also noticed that the back of my head felt pretty sensitive to the touch and my neck still felt pretty sore.  \n\nAnyways, the problem only got worse and I began feeling a dull pain in the back of my head all the time.  I also had a sort of disconnected feeling, like I wasn't really there no matter what I was doing.  I began having sharp pains in the back of my head when driving over potholes or taking a particularly aggressive step.  Jumping and running became pretty much unbearable.\n\nThings took a turn for the worst in late March when I was playing a game of pickup basketball and got elbowed in the head.  I didn't feel any new symptoms when it happened but decided to play it safe and called it a day.  The next day, I woke up with a much more severe headache and an aggressive brain fog that has become chronic.\n\nI went to a doctor to talk about it, but they dismissed the idea that it could have been a concussion because I had had ongoing symptoms involving my head prior to the basketball injury.  I had a CT scan of my head which came back clean, and I have had X-Rays of my neck which revealed \"military neck\" but no structural damage.\n\nIn the 5 months since that injury I've experienced no relief from my chronic headache and have even had spells where it's gotten worse.  The other day I tripped getting off an exercise bike and caught myself before falling over, and although I didn't hit my head at all, I have since had an extreme headache rebound and have been pretty much unable to function since.  The headaches are generally located all over the head but can manifest themselves as severe migraines in the forehead/temples with light and sound sensitivity.  I have tried PT, muscle relaxants, chiropracty, a nerve block to treat potential occipital neuralgia, and multiple medications to find relief but I'm still at a loss. \n\n\nWhat could be causing this?  Could it be prolonged concussion symptoms?  Is it something in my neck?  Any help is greatly appreciated.  \n\nTL;DR - 21 y/o healthy male suffering from chronic head and neck pain; no prior history of migraine or headache; symptoms aggravated by minor head trauma in March; extreme sensitivity to touch on back of head coupled with frontal/temporal migraine"

Never had anything like it before.  I mentioned it to my Primary Care Physician during a wellness exam around this time last year.  At that point, I had been experiencing it for a few months.  She kinda dismissed it but didn't really give me a helpful cause or name for what's going on...thinking that it was anxiety related.  \n\nI have another wellness exam in a few weeks, and the problem is back.  It was gone for probably 9 months.  It almost feels like a seasonal thing...but I don't know how or why.  Anyway, I'm not asking for a diagnosis here, as that would be impossible without an in-person exam.  Instead, I'm looking for maybe a better way for me to describe to her what's going on.  Maybe last year, however I described it wasn't helpful.  She of course listened to my heart, twice in fact.  And heard no murmurs or anything else out of line.  \n\nWhat's going on and what it feels like:  When it's going on, it happens mostly in the early afternoon, and sometimes at night.  I get a weird sensation around the bottom of my sternum (just pointing there as a helpful way to show where on the chest it's happening.  I don't think it has anything to do with the bones).  It almost feels like a twitch, 2nd heart beating (I know that sounds silly), or maybe something similar to the sensation you feel in your throat when you swallow something.  There's almost never pain associated.  I say \"almost never\" because one time I did feel a kind of sharp stab in my right upper chest area, right below the clavicle.  I don't know if that was a one-time fluke, or if it's part of it when I'm having a bad day.  I wear a Fitbit, and have checked my pulse when this happens and there's no noticeable fluctuation.  My resting heartbeat is in the 60-70 range, and although I have a family history of high blood pressure, mine has always been spot on.  \n\nI have a few extra pounds than I'd like, but I do exercise regularly:  I run 3 times a week (average weekly distance of about 9 miles or more), and swim 3 times a week (lap swims, distance will vary but I always swim for about an hour-and-a-half).  My diet is average to moderately healthy.  I eat normal guilty pleasure things like fried chicken, pizza, mac-and-cheese, etc., but I also throw in veggies and fruit daily.  \n\nI do drink more than I should, but I am working on it.  Ten or so years ago, I would go through a liter of vodka in about a week and a half plus beer and such.  Now, I don't do hard liquor very often, and try to limit my beer intake to 3 beers a day or less.  During Lent, I always give up alcohol.\n\nSorry that this is a lot to read, but maybe that's helpful.  Please ask any questions you'd like."

For as long as I can remember and going back to at least around 14 years old, I randomly have shots of super sharp pain in the pelvic/low abdomen area that last several seconds and go away without any trace of them ever happening. I never really questioned it because I figured it was normal and no one else thought it was weird when I would freeze and squeeze my eyes shut from the pain. This pain happens at any time, there has not been a pattern of it only happening around my period.\n\nIn the last year I started having digestive issues (the reason for my next doctors visit. I might have IBS, but they didn\u2019t find signs of IBD when I had upper and lower endoscopies done last year and I got distracted with school so I never followed up with my doctor after those tests and I\u2019m planning on doing that now to see if it really is IBS or if there are other tests to try) and my mom who used to be a nurse and is in the public health field started asking me about endometriosis which has made me start thinking about if I should mention these spontaneous, weird pains I have every once in awhile. The only medications I take are birth control for the last 3-4 years, laxatives/anti-diarrheal meds sometimes but not super often and only in the last year really. Nothing since before junior year of high school (I am a junior in college) and this pain started at least when I was 14, I can\u2019t remember if it happened before that or not so it\u2019s just a guesstimate.\n\nI have a history of kidney stones (yay!), and while it is very sharp like passing a stone, it is only for a few seconds and it happens often enough where if it were kidney stones I\u2019d be surprised and very concerned about my diet ahaha. If it weren\u2019t for the bowel issues and my mom mentioning endometriosis (which I have no idea what that pain is like and I really don\u2019t know how to describe my pain other than a few seconds of sharp pain in my pelvic area that happen so randomly), I probably never would have brought up this pain because it just seems so minor since it\u2019s only for a few seconds every once in awhile.

I started to get insecure about them in my teens when people started to comment on my skinny and very muscular legs and asking if I work out a lot. I used to believe it was because I was an active competitive swimmer until I was 16 but my legs remained just as muscular years after I quit and stopped working out regularly. The last person who asked me if I \u201cwork out a lot\u201d was by a coworker 2 weeks ago when I was changing clothes at work. \n\nIn addition to my legs being very thin and muscular I have an apple or V- shaped body where most of my fat is stored on my stomach, arms, back, face and breasts (I had a breast reduction 3 years ago because they were heavy on my back). I\u2019m not very muscular in these places. This is also something I\u2019m very insecure about so I try to avoid being in photos where my whole body is exposed or where my bare legs are showing because it looks very unfeminine and outright ugly to me. So as you can probably guess is this making me uncomfortable in my own body.\n\nSo what I wonder about is if 1) my very muscular legs has some connection with where my fat is distributed, 2) my body is just this way (it\u2019s my genetics) or 3) can there be some external cause for them looking like this (like a hormone imbalance), and 4) can I do something to tone them down?\n\nThank you."

I quite literally have not had a \u201cnormal poop\u201d in well over a year. I have always suffered from sleeping and intestinal issues (severe constipation and constant diarrhea) since I was 8 years old. Talked to my doctor after I could check every box and got tested for Celiac\u2019s\u2014negative. \n\nSmall preface: I maintain a healthy diet and exercise, but have had problems with the amount of food itself in the past. I have been unable to eat a regular amount in a day of food since April, and lately can only bear to have one smoothie (for example) as my food for the day. As a background, I have complaining of severe headaches and nausea/vomiting to my doctor for about four years now. I have been and am comfortable with writing those off as anxiety, but unsure. I have had low iron in the past. Always been sensitive to dairy products. I have had people commenting on my dilated pupils since I was 11 years old.\n\nI was diagnosed with Lyme\u2019s disease in Winter 2015/early 2016 and in February of 2018 went to a specialist, where then I took many many many supplements and some antibiotics until September. \n\nSome symptoms I had for Lyme and seem to have now (minus memory issues): Short term memory problems, brain fog, attention issues, insomnia, oversleeping yet feeling exhausted, pain in muscles, joint swelling, moodiness.\n\nFrom September until June, I had slow healing times and easily developed cuts/bruises, I constantly felt like I had a cold. I developed mono and warts on my feet, both signs of my immune system being weakened it seems. During this time I also ate no meat, but I have started again in the last two weeks. Started taking antidepressants in November, and still do. I have vomited well over 50 times since September. In April I fainted and lost consciousness, first and only time that has happened. I have since come very close to almost passing out several times. \n\nSince June, I have been dealing with crippling mental illness and physical pain. I am very cautious with the lifestyle I maintain, both diet and exercise, and I don\u2019t understand what else I can be doing to relieve myself of symptoms. \n\nMy abdomen is where I feel the majority of my problems occur. As said many times, I have problems eating because of nausea, keeping food down, and my stool is too soft/loose. Not constant but a re-occuring feeling of a heavy weight pressing on my stomach has been bothering me for years now (as if an elephant was crushing my stomach, not intestines).\n\nThe most prevalent symptoms are nausea/vomiting/cramping and extreme moodiness/anxiety depression. Food/eating is a major trigger for my nausea, anxiety, and fatigue. Anxiety and nausea beforehand and vomiting and fatigue afterwords. \n\nAre these just anxiety and Lyme symptoms? Something else? They feel different than before, kind of more serious? Thank you in advance."

I've seen countless doctors including a gastroentologist, been to the ER three times, had tests done (blood, urine, stool, colonoscopy) but no one can find anything. Honestly, doctors are sick of me already. It took me several weeks to connect the fact that it wasn't the way I was sitting that hurt me nor the time of day but it was when I smoked (vaped) marijuana. I can't find anything anywhere online where anyone has had anything remotely similar to me other than people who are vomiting but that's not the case. I haven't smoked in a week and even though I have minimal constant burning, I haven't had an attack where it burns so horribly bad, I'm convinced I'm dying from the inside. I honestly didn't think that's what caused it for me but I'm believing it more and more every day. Unless, of course, the marijuana is just exasperating what's already going on. The pain (during a flare up which was nightly for three months) would be from the bottom of my ribcage to the top of my knees, front of body only (if you can classify abdominal pain that way, it's never in my back). It started as upper abdominal and what seemed like nightly would continue to increase in size, moving down my body. Now that I've stopped smoking completely, I haven't had an attack (flare up) but I still have mild burning which seems to slowly be getting better. I've only smoked for four years, nightly for anxiety with a medical prescription but (I don't know if this is coincidence or not) edibles or oils do not process whatsoever in my body. They do nothing, never have. Also, my tolerance level has always been incredibly high, for all four years, and I never feel the effects of marijuana for longer than 45 mins but the severe pain will last hours and the residual pain lasts days/weeks."

I am creating this post on behalf of my friend, as I am a (former) medical student and might be able to phrase things more efficiently.\n\nShe is currently unable to pay for medical bills and as such, she cannot see a physician. We haven't examined or exhausted any possibilities of charity care or free clinics yet, so if you know of any affordable or free ways she can be assessed by a doctor in Phoenix, please leave suggestions. The purpose of this thread is not to diagnose her with anything, but to figure out whether or not her symptoms warrant a thorough checkup.\n\nShe has a history of fatigue, muscle weakness, sleepiness, occasional syncope, episodes of unilateral paresthesia and paralysis (typically right-sided) and more recently within the last 25-30 days, she's been experiencing very frequent and very noticeable heart palpitations, upwards of 140 or more an hour (pauses followed by extra forceful contractions). Additionally, she is also experiencing an onset of chest pain that radiates to the outer side of her left arm between the shoulder and triceps, lasting for approximately a week as of writing this. No shortness of breath, chest pain is stabbing. Doesn't worsen with exertion.\n\nAs stated, she was diagnosed with a murmur at some point in high school, and during a medical checkup last year, the murmur was still present upon auscultation. No data on prior echos, ECGs, blood work or blood pressure, although she does recall being told she was anaemic when she had blood work done last year. Has not had an echo performed.\n\nShe also has a history of daily migraines (7-8 out of ten on the pain scale) accompanied by vertigo/dizziness.\n\nIt is also important to note that she suffers from anxiety and possibly other hitherto undiagnosed mental illness.\n\nI've been trying to piece together her symptoms to see if there might be any pattern or link between them. Palpitations, murmur, fatigue, weakness, dizziness.. maybe something valvular? Stenosis, maybe? She often neglects to eat and frequently stays less than optimally hydrated for long periods of time, so there might also be a dehydration/electrolyte aspect to it (hypokalemia)."

Pins/needles feeling in both hands, and both feet from time to time. One night my right foot felt numb and asleep to the point that it was almost a burning sensation. It lasted a couple hours, then was gone by morning. A few times the pins/needles started going up the back of my leg. These sensations are accompanied by bouts of fatigue that feel almost like I'm about to pass out. They happen at work, in the morning, in the middle of the day, in the evening. I can't seem to correlate if they happen before or after eating. It seems like it doesn't matter. It's not my usual \"I feel tired\" feeling but more of a \"sharp\" tired feeling if that makes sense. \n\nHad a particularly bad morning last week where I felt like I was going to pass out and went to the urgent care. They took blood pressure sitting/standing/laying down, all normal. They took blood and found that my cholesterol was high, and that I could be slightly dehydrated. The doc at urgent care told me to make an appointment with my primary care doc to get the cholesterol looked at, and that if my symptoms didn't change to get a CT scan done.\n\nI've made an appointment with my doc, but the soonest they could see me is a week from now. \n\nI'm an otherwise healthy person, taking buspar, finasteride, and some stuff for allergies/acid reflux. Been on a keto diet for the past year or so.\n\nI've been driving myself crazy trying to figure out what's wrong with me. Everyone says it sounds like anxiety related symptoms. Other theories include some kind of vitamin deficiency. To me it feels neurological or nerve related maybe? I sit for work and have been trying to work on my not-great posture. Could it be related to that? Would love to hear any other thoughts on what it could be or things to try to feel better. Feeling lost and desperate. Thank you."

I\u2019m trying to pin point it but I didn\u2019t really do anything out of the ordinary. I was in the middle of cutting a guy\u2019s hair when I realized that if I moved a certain way, there would be a sharp stabbing pain in my upper back. It seems like it shoots across my entire upper back. It was difficult to figure out where the pain even started at first but feeling around, I pin pointed it to my upper left back near my shoulder blade. When I\u2019m not moving and in a comfortable position, it\u2019s not painful but it feels tight. And when I do get the pain, it\u2019s so sharp and abrupt that I have to stop/forget everything I\u2019m doing for that second. I tried to sleep it off with some cold compresses and later, a heating pad. But it seems now to be worse (not necessarily worse pain because it was already pretty bad but my movements seem to trigger it a lot more frequently now). \n\nWhen I was younger, I was in gymnastics and injured a disk (I didn\u2019t know this is what happened at the time) towards my mid to lower back. That pain was unlike anything I\u2019ve ever felt. I couldn\u2019t walk for about 2 days and it slowly started to get better on its own. I later had to go to physio due to dull aches in my lower back where my doctor told me that I had previously injured my disk and now my muscles were still contracted around it. We did IMS needles and I was better after the required sessions. The reason I tell you this, is to maybe rule out a disk being injured? Since I couldn\u2019t walk at all back then but now, even though it hurts, I can still walk. \n\nI have no numbing/tingling feeling. Is it worth it sitting in a hospital for about 6 hours or can I wait until Monday and make an appointment at the clinic? Do you guys have any recommendations on stretches/pain killers/anything else that could help me in the mean time? \n\nThanks in advance."

I'm 22 years old, 164 cm tall and I weight 50 kg.\n\nMy current medication is: triptizol (50 mg/day), espidifen 500 mg (only when I have a migraine), ethinylestradiol/drospirenone (0,03/3 mg) and probiotics (hyperbiotics pro-15 1 pill/day). I don't and have never smoked or taken any drugs. \n\nI have had migraines with aura since I was 8 years old aproximately, but my parents didn't know what was happening and I didn't know how to explain them what I was feeling. When I got my period (I was 13), the migraines went worse and they brought me to the neurologist. I started taking daily medication (propanolol) and rizatriptan for when I had a migraine. But neither of them were effective. I almost had a migraine with aura per day. \n\nApart from this, I also have had a really bad history with intestinal pain since I was very young. When I was 14 I was treated for H. Pylori and the symptoms diminished. However, I have always had digestive problems. \n\nWhen I was 18 I started taking birth control pills and surprisingly my migraines improved a lot. I just had a migraine per month aproximately. However, with time things got worse. Now I don't have a migraine per month, but I get a migraine crisis 4-5 times a year. These crisis are aproximately 2 weeks long and the pain is so strong that I usually end up in the hospital. My neurologist decided to change triptans for only espidifen 500mg (I have tried all sort of triptans and none of them have worked. Espidifen is what helps me the most with the pain) and triptizol 50 mg/day as prevention (I know it is a really low dosis, but if I take more I feel really dizzy and sleepy all day). Although espidifen helped me very much with the pain, the frecuency hasn't lowered.\n\nWhen I was 19, I discovered a relation between eating gluten and having migraines. Because of this I went to a dietist which recommended me to stop eating gluten for a month and see how it affected my migraines. I had 0 migraines and my intestinal symptoms improved a lot. What happened next is that when I tried to eat gluten again I couldn't. Just eating a cookie gave migraine with aura. I tried it more than once and the result was always the same, so I had to stop eating gluten because everytime I ate it I ended in the hospital.\n\nRight now, I have developed intolerance to eggs and also lactose and everytime I eat something with egg, milk, cheese... It gives me diarrhea or migraine crisis.\n\nThe gastroenterologist decided to do some tests. Fecal calprotectin was negative and I am still waiting for the results of the fructose and xylose intolerance test. I also took a blood test and it showed that I have low vitamin B12. The gastroenterologist said it was probably because of the diet changes. \n\nI am writting here because I feel really desperated. What if I keep developing new intolerances? What if I start to have more vitamin defficiencies? \n\nMy doctors said that they don't know what is happening. My neurologist told me to get used to it because maybe this is how my migraines behave and my gastroenterologist also told me to get new intolerances. Even the last time I went to the hospital because of a migraine crisis they accused me of not taking my medication correctly, but that was not true. They also said to me that I couldn't go to the hospital so frecuently and they didn't even believe that I was having a migraine crisis because it was \"too weird\". \n\nI don't feel like I have any medical support and I really need someone to give me any advice or answer. \n\nSorry for making such a long message. I really hope that someone can help me. \n\nThank you in advance"

These issues have very gradually worsened over the course of the past 7-8 years, when it began. It used to feel more like solely a mental tiredness/burnout feeling but has gradually escalated to include a good amount of sleepiness as well. It\u2019s gotten so bad I don\u2019t even feel like I\u2019m in real life I\u2019m so out of it. I have had virtually every test under the sun done. Many of them multiple times. The only thing I\u2019m waiting on right now is a B12 absorption test that tests for the body\u2019s ability to absorb and utilize vitamin B12 correctly. \n\nAssuming this test comes back fine, I need to (and pretty much have already) finally come to the realization that my nonstop tiredness/fogginess is probably the result of a cumulative combination of: \n\n1. Generalized anxiety that maybe I didn\u2019t/don\u2019t realize is anxiety. Maybe a bit of a de-realization + \u201caccustomness\u201d in feeling like this for so long. \n\n2. Undiagnosed ADD possibly (just recently got prescribed Adderall, seems to help a bit). \n\n3. Personality characteristics that definitely don\u2019t help (Type A personality, perfectionist tendencies, high achiever/expectations, strong moral compass, tend to worry more than I should, too hard on myself, etc.) \n\n4. Possibly a bit of depression as a result of how much this has impacted my life. Relationships fading cause I couldn\u2019t function. Hobbies/interests lacking due to fatigue as well as having to spend all day having to cope with my symptoms, etc. \n\nAny advice/tools that could help?

I have been on birth control, Junel FE continuous cycle for the past 4 years so I haven\u2019t had any periods but in July I took a three week break as recommended by my therapist to see if it was causing any of my depressive symptoms. I started taking the pill again 2 weeks ago as I was sexually active and I had some minor spotting until I got my period this week. I\u2019m assuming the period is a side effect of the hormone changes, but I have been in excruciating pain this past week. I fainted once on the first day of my period and have vomited everyday. I have no history of pregnancy and had a negative test a week ago at the doctors. They also did bloodwork and it came back normal. I also started Pristiq 25 mg, an antidepressant, on Monday but I stopped taking it on Wednesday due to shakiness and migraines (May have been caused by this \u201cperiod). The clots I\u2019m passing typically have been happening first thing in the morning. I have been waking up everyday in intense pain and then about half an hour later I make my way to the bathroom and pass the clots. I have a history of ovarian cysts, a bartholins cyst, and my mother has a history of fibroids. I\u2019m not sure what to do to stop the bleeding at this point, I just want it to stop. The pain is horrible and I\u2019ve taken the largest amount recommended of Advil everyday but it hasn\u2019t done much to subside the pain.\n\n*UPDATE EDIT 5:10 pm*: I decided to take my temperature for the first time and I have a 100.5 degree fever with 800 mg of Advil in my system since I took it at 1 PM."

So I'm not sure if this is the right thread or not but skimming through r/Psychiatry 's pinned post it may be (\"If you are asking for advice or a diagnosis, check r/AskDocs instead\").\n\n\nSo throughout growing up I've experienced what I'd like to call \"non-threatening medical problems\" (panic attacks, social issues, small sickness like stomach aches from anxiety, joint pain, random pain, headaches, struggling to focus, struggling to get around easily, overheating, ect), not sure if that's the right phrasing but it's the only thing I can think of to describe my issues. I believe going to a psychiatrist and getting diagnosed and treated would help a lot of my problems, but I'm struggling with a few things. One would be I'm a minor. So, I'm unable to get help by myself without asking a parent or adult in my life, which wouldn't be a problem if I wasn't extremely scared to ask for help in all situations even if it's possibly life threatening, how would I bring it up to them? While in a secluded area such as in a car ride? Ask via email or text? Another is I'm often forgetful. Because of this I was thinking I should write down all of my symptoms in a google doc, but would that seem suspicious? I have a pretty good idea of what mental issues I may have (I believe I may have some physical ones as well, I would probably need to see the family or a local doctor to have those addressed, correct? Should I bring up my physical issues like struggling to get around and overheating to the psychiatrist?), but I don't want it to seem like I looked up symptoms of mental disorders and tried to convince the doctor that I have problems I don't. Do I write them all down on a piece of paper, or would the document be okay to use? Should I say what issues I believe I may have? I'm not really sure what I should do at all since my only knowledge of how a session goes is from forms of media.\n\n\nThanks for any advice and help!\n\n\nTLDR; I want to go to a psychiatrist but don't know how to ask for help, and once I get there I don't know how I should present my symptoms.\n\n\nEdit: was removed for not following guidelines, 15, 5'2, ~180lb (actually one issue I want to address with the psychiatrist is my food pickiness to the point certain textures/smells/tastes/looks make me physically ill possibly being more than just \"being too picky\"), female (trans guy, but have not transitioned socially or medically), currently taking vitamin supplements for not eating properly, have not smoked or used any type of drug besides over the counters when ill (most commonly use Tums for stomach issues, used to use homoeopathic remedies because my dad insisted).

        "reddit": "36 y/o Caucasian Female; 5'6\" 179  \nDuration of complaint: \\~2 mos.   \nLocation: Neck - left side thyroid gland enlargement post-biopsy  \nCurrent Meds: Wellbutrin; currently on 2nd course of 20mg prednisone   \n2018 labs: TSH levels indicated hyperthyroidism, while my T3/T4 were in the normal range. Current labs: all thyroid levels are normal.   \nFamily history of Hashimoto's disease (mom), thyroid cancer (grandmother) and thyroid inflammation (aunt)\n\nIn June, I went for a bilateral thyroid biopsy for several nodules: one 4cm fluid-filled nodule on the left side, multiple small nodules on the right. Per the ultrasound, all were low-suspicion, but due to the size of the left nodule, they sent me for a biopsy, and also requested that the left-side nodule be drained during the process. (Note: At this point, I had never experienced any visible thyroid swelling)\n\nMy biopsy was done by an interventional radiologist who was rushed and very aggressive. I waited about 20 minutes in the room while the attending nurse was calling around trying to find a doctor because none was assigned. The Dr. rushed in, complained about the ultrasound machine that was in the room, and requested that the nurse find a better one. He then started the biopsy on the left side \\*without the ultrasound machine\\*. When the nurse returned, he remarked \"by the time I get this machine set up, her biopsy will be done!\" The doctor drained the left side, took samples, and moved to the right side, where it became very... aggressive. I could feel him hitting something internally in my neck and was experiencing ear pain. I asked him if that was normal and he said \"no\", but continued on. At one point, the doctor squirted something that smelled like alcohol all over my face, hitting my eyes, which thankfully were closed. The entire process took an hour, and afterwards I looked in the mirror and saw that my entire neck was bulging out and swollen. \n\nI'm going to break the rest out in bullets just to keep this as short as possible:\n\n* The next day, I had a fever of 101.4 and redness and burning on my neck. I went to the ER, but by the time I was seen, my fever had subsided. They treated me for contact dermatitis. \n* It took a week for overall swelling to subside, and once it did, I saw that the left side of my thyroid was now protruding out of my neck. \n* I started experiencing warmth and throbbing in my neck. I took my blood pressure and it was slightly elevated (140/80) but I figured it was because I'd just eaten a salty meal. \n* The following day, I felt generally fine and calm. I was getting ready to eat dinner and decided to take my BP again before eating just to make sure it was back to normal. It was 174/152.  I live 2 blocks away from an urgent care so decided to have them check my BP, as I assumed my machine was just broken. My BP was still high, so they encouraged me to visit the ER as the nurse was concerned that it was related to my thyroid. I went to the ER and they ran a multitude of tests (including a CT scan of my head and neck). Ultimately, they diagnosed me with anxiety and sent me on my way. \n* Had a follow-up appointment with my endocrinologist, who said she's never had a patient experience this after a biopsy. Gave me a 5-day course of steroids (20mg prednisone) hoping that would reduce inflammation. She also informed me that my biopsy results were inconclusive, as all of the samples the doctor had taken were tainted with blood. \n* I'm now on a second 5-day course of 20mg prednisone, as the first did not work. The endocrinologist has no answers for me, and told me that if this course of steroids fails to work, she'll have to refer me to an ENT.  \n* I've noticed that the left side of thyroid will swell and become visibly enlarged in response to the following: stress, salt intake and increased blood flow (after exercise, etc.). (Note: I'm not experiencing any pain or discomfort)  \n\n\nMy endocrinologist has no explanation for why this is happening and the fact that she's just referring me to another specialist is frustrating. I'm hoping that someone might be able to provide a bit of additional insight or may have a clue as to what could be triggering this. Thank you in advance!"

The kind you'd normally feel after you ate something quite fast and you need to drink a bit of water to wash it down, that's the best way I can describe it. Only that no amount of water was able to wash it away. Also this was accompanied by a bit of coughing.\n\nAt work, i've started to notice that my scalp, face and ears were very itchy at around 10:00-11:00, after I had some breakfast. As I work with 2 large monitors I thought it might be from the screens, so I went and washed my face thinking that the irritation would go away.\n\nLunchtime, the itching has spread to my neck, armpits and upper arms. I had a couple hot flush and I thought it was just me sweating a little. Also I started to feel a little tingle in my lips. My colleague, whom I was at lunch with, said my face looked red. Before going back to my desk I went to the toilet and this is the first time I noticed an itchy red patch of skin with raised spots just under the belt line. I told my manager and a first aider who gave me a couple of antihistamines tablets in case it might be an allergic reaction. I suffer from hay fever and atypical ibs.\n\nA few minutes later the same type of rash: red, itchy with raised spots was present under both my armpits. At this point I was sent home under the fear that it might be shingles.\n\nThe commute home takes about 1h. When I got home most of the rash started to fade away.  \n[https://imgur.com/a/7AzDbUD](https://imgur.com/a/7AzDbUD)\n\nI made a number of calls to 111 where I got medical advice over the phone. Generally all agents I talked to suggested the rash was my body reacting to some sort of allergen despite that, to my knowledge, I didn't get exposed to anything out of the ordinary, recently. I haven't changed the detergent used to wash my clothes, didn't eat anything I haven't eaten before, etc.\n\nIt was probably late afternoon when I went for a nap as I was feeling a bit tired. I woke up, had some dinner and I was talking to my mom over skype when I noticed the rash on the inside of my thigh. On further inspection it was on the inside of both my thighs and a few spots on the left side of my torso. Also I could feel the chest knot again, a slight wheezing sound when breathing and it was slightly painful to swallow.\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/qknkeHc](https://imgur.com/a/qknkeHc)\n\nRang for medical advice again and in light of new symptoms they called an ambulance. The paramedics listened to my heart, took my temperature etc. I was told everything is normal, it looks like I have a reaction to something, we narrowed it down it could potentially be eggs as I had 3 today (one as a snack early in the morning, 2 small ones for breakfast and some mayo in the evening). The advice was to book an appointment with my GP ASAP and get some allergy tests done. As this happened Firday and my GP practice is closed over the weekend I have to wait until Monday.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Today (Saturday):**\n\nI woke up with a puffy face and the rash has grown to cover most of my torso, arms and legs. I took an antihistamine but throughout the day the rash has died down and reappeared a number of times, changing in shape, size and position on the body. My temperature went slightly up from 36.6 at 07:15 to 37.6 at 11:10 then back down in the evening.\n\nOther symptoms experienced today: Knot in the chest with wheezing, tickle when breathing and pain when swallowing or burping. Congested and runny nose, feeling hot, like I have a fever despite normal body temperature, sore throat, piles flareup.\n\nBelow more photos of rash progression throughout the day:\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/DHX8t0K](https://imgur.com/a/DHX8t0K)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**GP visit this evening:**\n\nThis evening I went to an out of hours GP and it is confirmed to be a blanching rash as a result of an allergic reaction. I was told it is not serious and that it might disappear as quick as it appeared. As the symptom is quite vague I was advised I might never be able to identify the cause of it and I am unlikely to get an allergy test on the NHS and that even if I oay for it I might not find an answer. When I asked about the knot in the chest, that as attributed to anxiety. At this point I didn't feel like bringing up the other symptoms would make a difference as they seemed less relevant to the case.  \n\n\nI'm not sure if I have unrealistic expectations but I wasn't particularly impressed with the consultation. I didn't really learn anything new and I'm still uncertain whether there are red flags other than \"if you have trouble breathing call an ambulance\".  \n\n\nI'd be curious to hear other people's opinions as I feel like I'm on my own."

        "reddit": "So it started yesterday, around 7:30 i was smoking a THC cart with some friends. Randomly i get this VERY odd feeling in the left back side of my brain, i jumped out of my chair freaking out saying call 911. I rapidly started explaining the feeling i had to my friends the best i could saying things like, \"It feels like im on DMT\" and saying it was like a whole mix of feelings. Temperature and pressure felt off in that part of my head. It started to spread almost like one would imagine a numbing agent would when injected into my brain. Numbing and \"buzzing\" through my head and spreading rapidly through my head and body but almost pulsing out of that spot. I felt moments of near dissociation or incoherence with my words and just awareness. My friends calmed me down enough to not call 911, i ended up laying down on a nearby couch for about 2 hours. I called my GF because i was freaking the fuck out, literally thought i was dying. Today i had to step out of work and had another mini freak out again same feeling and psychology this feeling in my brain again the back/side of the left side of my brain. the feeling was with me most of today through the day In my mind i definitely was having major stress and anxiety, but i cant connect it directly to the experience. When my thoughts where at the most potent in a fear/stress sense the feeling almost coincided with that. It seems nearly impossible for me to be having such an intense physiological response like this due to just anxiety and stress. I will admit i have had recently a growing and intense fear of death. Also i broke up with my GF on her birthday a week before (Yes im an asshole) we have recently tried giving it a shot again so that could be stressing. I tried DMT for the first time about 6 months ago but again i don't see the connection other than the feeling (I would say DMT felt like a death experience and it was not really enjoyable. very shaking). Im sorry if this post feels a little disordered. I dont know if i should be worried about something serious and could cause death. But im scared currently and i dont know what to do. I dont have insurance and i have little saved money. So im not exactly in a spot to be paying for treatment. What would the wisest choices and options be in my position? Thank you in advance for your help.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIm a male 19 Years old (20 in Sept) im about 5'9 and i weigh 120lbs.

I get the flu once every 2 or 3 years for like a day or so but that's it. I was prescribed Levofloxacin from the doctor and I haven't been taking anything else for this besides Ibuprofen (usually take 2 pills every 8 hours).\n\nEarly on I'd be getting the chills pretty harshly or a fever harshly, sometimes I'd wake up and my entire head ended up soaking my pillow to the point where I had to swap it out. I'd be coughing mucus too. I also have not been able to vomit since getting this, if I try it just ends up being dry heaves. The biggest issue is it's been costing me a lot of sleep each night, most nights it gets broken up quite a bit and I only get like 3 to 4 hours. \n\nLong story short I'm curious if there's anything I can do to speed this up, like eating oranges, taking a hot bath, or trying to keep coughing to get as much mucus out as possible. I had a pneumonia almost 20 years ago and pretty much what got me over it was one night just waking up and suddenly and unexpectedly coughing up A LOT of mucus. I got the feeling the same will happen. That being said, does anyone have tips to try to speed up my recovery? Just want to finally get a good night rest."

Initial blood tests on 07/26/2019 and secondary 08/14/2019.\n\nLocation (Geographic and on body): Born and raised in New York, moved permanently to Romania 2 years ago alone.\n\nAny existing relevant medical issues (if any): Bulging disc in lower back since 18. Emergency laparoscopic appendectomy at 15 and coblation tonsillectomy at 18 (performed in the US) due to persistent tonsil infections. Long history of gastroenterological issues including Functional Abdominal Pain Syndrome (FAPS) where I took cyproheptadine b.i.d. from ages 12-15, and yearly stomach ulcers treated with omeprazole + antibiotics from age 15 on.\n\nCurrent medications (if any): None\n\nInclude a photo if relevant (skin condition for example): N/A\n\n--------------\n\nTowards the end of last month, I scheduled blood work at a private hospital in Bucharest, Romania to meet the requirements of my life insurance provider. I was tested for a wide variety of things: CHEM-12, Lipid Panel, hsCRP, CBC, Thyroid Function Panel, Estrogen, and Testosterone. The results of this initial bloodwork were that my liver enzymes were increased, high cholesterol, and testosterone was 9.79 nmol/L.\n\nAs I've been suffering from erectile disfunction for several years, amongst other physical changes listed above, I decided to see a urologist. He conducted a physical exam with the result of normal sized testicles and no other physical abnormalities. Furthermore, he conducted an ultrasound of my kidneys which were okay, and sent me off with a script for more bloodwork and a urine test. The bloodwork comes back with a testosterone level of 9.05 nmol/L, PSA 1.24 ng/mL, and Free PSA 49.52% (so prostate cancer should be ruled out at least).\n\nFrom what I can see, this testosterone level is on the low side of what's acceptable, and significantly lower than the average levels of someone else my own age. I'm typically not scared by medical issues, but from what I can see my prior tests rule out some of the obvious causes such as diabetes (type 2 runs in family), hypothyroidism (Hashimoto's disease runs in family), liver/kidney failure, Klinefelter syndrome, etc... which is leaving me to wonder what could be the root cause of my low T levels, and what does it mean for my future.\n\nI was hoping someone with more experience could chime in on this situation and help calm my mind until my next appointment with the urologist at the end of next week. If I end up on replacement therapy, is this something that would be lifelong? Does it have any affect on life expectancy or fertility? Does any of my past medical history combined with elimination of other bloodwork results ring any bells for a possible root cause, so that I can preemptively get imaging before my appointment (e.g. bone density scan, MRI)?"

Prior to that, my periods were very irregular in both time (I went as long as 14 months without one) and severity.\nAbout a month into having the Nexplanon, I started spotting, to varying degrees, but it was pretty consistently happening every day. Mostly like a light period...annoying but tolerable. After a month of this, I called my GYN and he said it\u2019s normal within the first 6 months. The spotting continued pretty much constantly until about ~6-8 weeks ago where it started happening much less frequently, sometimes days in between and at one point, I thought it was over with.\nHowever, right around the same time, I started noticing that the spotting I did have was worse after sex. Even with the daily spotting going away, the post-sex spotting has continued and I think is actually getting worse. I\u2019ve noticed that there is more true blood vs. bloody discharge. I\u2019ve also started experiencing some discomfort afterward and have had to use lube every time I\u2019ve had sex recently (which was never needed before.) \nI just saw my GYN on Tuesday - he said if spotting continued at 6 month mark he wanted to see me. I didn\u2019t even think about the correlation between sex and the bleeding/spotting until just now so I didn\u2019t mention it specifically but he said the spotting itself may improve over time or I may be one of the women who are stuck with it as a side effect and may have to either be ok w/ that or switch to another form of birth control.\nI guess my question is - is it normal to have this particular side effect (pain/bleeding from sex) from Nexplanon, especially this far out from being implanted? Should I be concerned about anything else? I had a normal Pap smear in August 2018, STI panel in January, same partner for almost a year now (who had a normal STI panel in ~May 2019.) Was not vaccinated for HPV (thanks, mom.) Have used protection with all of my partners. Nothing about the sex itself has changed as far as roughness, foreplay, etc and even when I specifically kept things slow just to see if that helped, it happened.\n\nAny advice is appreciated! \n\nTLDR: concerned about discomfort and bleeding after sex - a side effect of birth control or something else?"

        "reddit": "I (23F) caucasian, 5\u20197 and 210lbs in Alberta have always thought there was something off about my periods. \n\nIt started as intense cramping in my early teens, which my parents (mom\u2019s a nurse) shrugged off as being a girl and also not wanting to go to school. The cramping got progressively worse, ending up with me in the hospital every few months with possible appendicitis but my appendix was never inflamed, chalked it up to me complaining about cramps. \n\nIt got to the point where it was so frequent and excruciating that in late 2016 I literally thought I was going to die from my stomach pain. Mom told me to take a gravol, and I ended up driving myself 20 minutes to the nearest hospital while sobbing and I was rushed into surgery for an emergency appendectomy. \n\nThe last year or so, I keep asking my GP whenever I see him if it\u2019s normal to not have a period from 6m to a year apart. Told it\u2019s probably a hormone imbalance and shrugged off. \n\nA few months back my grandmother is visiting me and over wine one night she brings up how hard it was to conceive and carry a baby to full term. My father was a stroke of luck and she wasn\u2019t able to have any more children after that. Goes into detail about how she never had a period really growing up and I tell her about my own struggles. She advises me to get a second opinion. \n\nI bring it up again with GP and he says I probably have PCOS and sets me up with an ultrasound. Follow up with GP let\u2019s me know that ultrasound confirmed it, and so naturally I question my steps and solutions to this problem. \n\nThis is where I get confused. \n\nMy GP asks if I\u2019m planning on having children at the moment, which I deny, but that I\u2019d like more information if it\u2019s going to interfere in the future. Am told that it\u2019s harmless as long as I\u2019m not looking to get pregnant and that when the time comes I\u2019ll just need to take some pills to force an ovulation and it should be fine. As awesome as this sounds (no monthly bleeding won\u2019t find me complaining), I ask for a little more information and am referred to an OBGYN.\n\nOBGYN asks a lot of questions; last menstrual cycle (can\u2019t remember exactly, upwards of 6 months), family history of diabetes (grandfather and father), family history of bowel cancer (grandmother), smoker (used to), weight gain (yes, 60lbs in the last few years), cramps (excruciating). \n\nWhen I finally talk to OBGYN she seems pretty concerned with my situation. Says that if I don\u2019t get this thing regulated I\u2019m putting myself at high risk for diabetes and cancer. Says a lot of other stuff about needing to change my diet, cut out sugar, start exercising more. \n\nGives me a prescription for pills to jumpstart my period, warns me it\u2019ll be heavy. Take the pills for the 10 days as ordered, starting to worry I\u2019m not going to get a period but oh boy did I. I was told to have two different blood tests done on Day 3 of bleeding and Day 21 after the first day of bleeding. \n\nI\u2019m waiting a little over a week now to get my second blood test done before I schedule a follow-up with my OBGYN. \n\nI mean obviously technology has come a long way since my grandmother was having troubles in the 60\u2019s and I know PCOS isn\u2019t uncommon. \n\nI guess my question is, how serious is this in my situation? I\u2019m not taking it lightly by any means, I\u2019ve been looking for a reason to get myself back into shape but didn\u2019t have the push that I do now, and diabetes hangs over my head like a cloud and I\u2019d prefer to avoid it if at all possible."

Everything went away after 2 days, after drinking lots of water and sleeping with multiple pillows. However recently, the head heaviness has come back, but it isn\u2019t accompanied by anything. I also feel a pain when I press around a bone protruding from my skull, which I believe is the occipital bone. I have been so paranoid about this, and I can\u2019t get my mind off of it, as I always think that it\u2019s something bad. My head feels a little heavier when I bend down. I believe this is the cause of either spending too much time in the sun, dehydration, or being a little deprived of sleep. But like I said, I keep thinking it is much worse. Now, these \u201csymptoms\u201d show up, but I\u2019m not sure if they\u2019re real. Sometimes I may hear faint ringing in my ears, or i feel like I have blurry vision, but I can\u2019t tell if these are real symptoms or just being caused by anxiety or like a placebo effect sort of thing.

I also get nauseous every once in a while, and some loud sounds irritate me. These symptoms go away when I\u2019m having fun, but come back when I start thinking about them. I also put on 10-15 pounds this summer (but I did eat a lot and grew like two inches, and I\u2019m 14 and I was projected to get a growth spurt), but I keep thinking this is an unexpected weight gain.

Initially he lost a lot of weight, he may have weighed around 210 when he was first diagnosed and is rapidly losing muscle mass. A year has gone by and he has never once eaten a fruit, touched any type of bread or flour product, and followed the doctors orders to leave all dairy, but he eats cheese at least once every two or three weeks. He snacks on cucumbers, nuts, celery, and other veggies and orders salads with no dressing and a grilled chicken whenever we go to restaurants. \n\nPoint blank, his sugar levels have never risen above 120 for a full year. He takes Metformin pills prescribed by the doctor, one in the morning and one in the evening after meals. \n\nWe went to get his blood drawn today and I have a few questions regarding his condition. \n\n1. Is he still deteriorating from the inside? What risks does he have if he takes care of himself? \n\n2. The doctor suggested some B12 shots? I\u2019m surprised he didn\u2019t mention what the benefits are or what they do. I\u2019m wondering if anyone knows about those shots and how they benefit him.\n\n3. He\u2019s been extremely lethargic, what could be causing this? What foods are suggested to up how energy without largely impacting his blood sugar? \n\n4. He\u2019s developed a very loud ringing in his ears that is most likely caused by the loud sounds from his construction work. HOWEVER, he says that this ringing is like a pounding in his head, that it\u2019s like a large generator humming very loudly while someone is crushing his skull and creating a lot of pressure, where afterwards he feels very dizzy and everything starts to sound very distant, like he\u2019s underwater. What could be causing that? He\u2019s definitely going to go deaf, he\u2019s been working with loud machines for 30+ years but he said this experience was recent and after his diagnosis.\n\n5. His bones all hurt very much in the mornings after just waking up. Is there anything he can do or take to ease that pain? \n\n6. He\u2019s considering not taking his evening pill.

This is more than likely a fault of my own bad living habits but i\u2019m not sure what exactly.  \n\nAt first it was in the top and front of my head like most headaches. Then after that it was the side/back of my head, mostly my ears(not inside them but the actual ear itself, like the part that hangs off your head) and behind my ears and above my neck, it commonly goes back to hurting there now but sometimes it hurts in my shoulders, and at the base of the back of my neck. Then when i woke up on Wednesday morning(the 14th) it was an intense pain behind my eyes, mostly when i move them without moving my head, if i looked up or sideways too hard it gave me an awful pain. I also had a bad sensitivity to light, but on Wednesday night i slept for a few hours and woke up and it was almost gone, it only hurt when i strained my eyes looking certain directions. I have very poor eyesight aswell and may need glasses, but i can\u2019t imagine that would make my neck and ears hurt. Now it switches between the back of my head and neck and behind my eyes. \n\nHere\u2019s some details about my condition: i exercise often, i\u2019m a huskier lad but i have decent conditioning, i usually eat what i want(which is a problem in of its own, i\u2019m workin on it) but i drink lots of water, and when i\u2019m not drinking water it\u2019s tea. \nI have poor oral health due to my eating habits and childhood laziness, and i imagine this is what has caused it. I have been diagnosed with TMJ and Insomnia but have never gotten any sort of treatment for it, i have a bad underbite and several cavities, although no signs of abscess yet. Usually i sleep about 6 hours, i\u2019ll wake up around noon then won\u2019t go to bed until 4/5 in the morning. My headache has really made me want to eat less so i\u2019ve mostly been eating small things every so often and drinking water only although today i indulged in a cherry cola. The only other medical problems i have are bad back pain from poor posture and a day or two before i got a headache i dissociated pretty badly, i was violently jerking myself awake because it felt like my limbs went numb. I have not taken any serious blows to the head that i\u2019m aware of, not in a good bit at least. \n\nI know it\u2019s a lot to unload, i\u2019m definitely working on the self care aspect now that im an adult and can actually do something about it. Feel free to ask me any questions that might help but can you guys please help, i have bad anxiety and this headache has got me bad worried and i really would like to know what\u2019s going on.\n\nBe easy please, i was very sheltered when i was younger so i have insanely limited medical knowledge"

There's this one spot (about 1 in. diameter) almost halfway down (but closer to the humerus than the wrist) my forearm that's sweating continuously. At first I thought it was pus and that maybe I had an infected wound somehow or something, so I dried it off and looked closely; there were beads of liquid forming at semi regular intervals of space in a 1 in. diameter circle-ish area. At this point the continuous sweating has irritated the skin in that spot so it's a little red ([picture linked](https://imgur.com/a/SxJb1Ut) but it's kinda hard to see).\n\nI'm not taking any kind of medication currently, and I don't have any other skin problems. I do have migraines, and I also had a headache a few weeks ago that felt like someone shooting me through the temple with a nailgun, but I don't know if those are relevant.\n\nAlso, when I say continuous, I mean that nothing I try has stopped it. I've tried a cold environment, I've tried a hot environment, I've tried washing the spot with water, I've tried washing it with soap and water, I've tried to put moisturizing lotion on it, I've tried covering it with a cloth (the cloth just gets soaked in an hour). Frankly, it's not even that debilitating, just super annoying, and the sweat is starting to make the skin sting.  \n\n\nWhat exactly is going on? Is this a symptom of a known condition?"

I've been with her for almost seven years now, and there has been a couple times where she has been very close to ending her life. Thankfully we have gotten through hard times and have been able to be generally happy.\n\n Recently she has been going through a tough time. A lot of aspects in our life just aren't going our way, for instance we are currently living in a hotel because our apartment flooded, and we don't have enough money to pay for the insurance deductible to cover our bed, furniture or anything really. She also lost her job recently due to her depression keeping her away from work. We also have a happy and healthy three-year-old daughter together that she mainly takes care of as well on top of that as she is home while I work and she is feeling very overwhelmed being at home all day. All of this and more adds up and puts a big strain on her. \n\nShe is pretty medically inclined, and wants to become a nurse. She has been doing a lot of research lately in to different disorders and such, because she has suspicions that she might be on the autism spectrum and/or has borderline personality disorder. she has been going really in depth cause she checks a lot of the criteria to fit that diagnosis. After going over all of the symptoms and other cases, a lot of things line up. Like a lot a lot. \n\nHer doctor isn't really taking anything seriously though, he isn't even entertaining the idea. He actually told her once the other week to just try being happier when she went to go change her meds. He upped her dosage on the meds that aren't helping her and just making her nauseous. she has another appointment booked with him for next week, but we fear that he's not going to take it seriously again when we bring up the autism and BPD. All we want is a actual test or something to say whether or not she's right about her assumptions. She doesn't think it's just anxiety and depression. Cuz it gets really bad sometimes and she breaks down to the point where she just cannot operate at all whatsoever every so often and is in constant mood swings that often leave her in crying and screaming fits that can't be calmed. \n\nMy girlfriend really wants to get in to see a psychiatrist, and have a one-on-one sit-down and dig deep into her own mind with a trained professional. Unfortunately around here it isn't cheap and the only free option we could find was group therapy but she could only attend one day before her anxiety took over, she can't deal with random people being there too, she needs one on one help and we cannot afford to pay for hundreds of dollars worth of sessions, especially seeing as we can't even pay for the deductible on our apartment insurance. \n\nIf she actually gets diagnosed with these more severe problems is there a way to get free sessions with a psychiatrist through the government or something? I really don't know how any of this works I just really want to make sure that she has the best Mental Healthcare possible, because up until now it's been basically just \"here take these pills and try to be happier\" which clearly isn't working.\n\nThanks ahead of time."

This has been driving me insane as of late and due to my current work schedule it is really hard to see a doctor at this moment, so I  thought I would at least get some sort of opinion as I can't find ANYTHING on google that is relevant.\n\nI can't be sure of when I first noticed it - it was awhile back - but I have two symmetrical bumps, one on each side of my ribs.  They are the same size more or less and are in the exact same place.  They are located close to the point where the ribs turn to my sides, and are about an inch above the point where my ribs end at the bottom.  They are hard to the touch and feel hard enough to be bone.\n\nA few notes:\n\n\\- I do not feel any considerable pain or discomfort, though it can be hard to tell as I can manifest symptoms with anxiety, but I know it is certainly minor at worst.\n\n\\- There is no pain when touching unless I apply a lot of pressure there\n\n\\- I am unclear if they are growing or when they first appeared, though they have not always been there.  They stand out now as I lost 30 pounds of weight in the last 6 months.\n\n\\- They are relatively large in size I feel, though that's subjective.  Maybe similar to the size of your thumb's knuckle, maybe a little larger, and come to a point.\n\nI hope this is a good enough explanation.  And while I don't have access to a phone, outside of pointing out the area, they don't really show at all with a camera.\n\nThanks in advance to anyone who takes the time to read.

I will be upfront and state that I have had an appalling diet over the years, consisting of pizza, curries, fatty foods and diet soda. I have not had any previous medical conditions - when I was around 14/15, I had blood in my stool, which went away for a few years but has since returned. \n\nI have been having some stomach pains since around late May. The pain seems to move around my abdomen: I sometimes feel a dull pain in the lower belly, and a sharper pain in the upper abdomen. I feel an almost constant low-level nausea, and am always in fear of vomiting, making me scared to leave the house sometimes (I should note however that although I sometimes taste vomit after burping, I have not thrown up since this condition started). I have very little appetite and feel bloated after eating. I also get unusually gassy after eating heavy meals (on doc's advice, I have been eating small and frequently since Monday). I also have some bad heartburn on the right side of my chest, and often get acid reflux when I eat. \n\nThe pains in my abdomen are nothing unbearable I guess - I should note I have been losing a lot of weight this last year (which my doctor has suggested may be due to my job, which involves a lot of heavy lifting).\n\nPerhaps it is irrelevant but I have suffered a lot with extreme depression and anxiety since childhood (am currently taking prozac for it). My doctor has told me that he thinks it is likely I have either gallstones or a stomach ulcer. I am going for an ultrasound scan on Tuesday, which I am not too nervous about. If these results show nothing I will be going for an endoscopy to check my esophagus and stomach for any inflamation. I am extremely afraid that the endoscopy will show no results, and doctors will not be able to do anything for me. I am so scared that I will be in pain for the rest of my life and never enjoy any of the foods I love again. On multiple occasions I have felt so afraid for my health that I was considering suicide as an option (I am in therapy). Doctor has prescribed me 30mg Zoton and 1 mg Motillium for my stomach pangs, and they seem to work okay, though I still feel some discomfort.\n\nThrowing myself at your mercy.

It is literally happening all day. Every day. I have noticed that I have been getting headaches more frequently since they started, and I have a lot more tension in my back, neck and legs.

        "reddit": "I\u2019m a 34-year-old male who\u2019s been having a lot of sexual dysfunction during these last couple of months. It happened a little bit after I went off of antidepressants (after 10 years of being on them), which was almost like a joke played on me, considering the sexual side effects were what made me quit them in the first place (I researched PSSD but the jury\u2019s still out on that one apparently). Since then, I\u2019ve had trouble with numbness in my penis, and even when there is sensitivity, it takes me probably 15 minutes to achieve an erection, and the erection never lasts more than 10 seconds. Sometimes I can\u2019t achieve an erection at all and just give up.\n\nThis past week, something more disturbing has happened. I usually masturbate while sitting upright in my bed. I noticed that when I was able to achieve orgasm, an unusually small amount of semen was coming out. These past couple days, NOTHING is coming out. I still feel the pleasure from the orgasm, but it\u2019s essentially a dry orgasm. \n\nSome further background: I\u2019ve also had trouble with frequent urination for the past 9 years. I had emergency surgery to remove my gallbladder in 2010, and when I woke up, I could feel the pain of the catheter taken out of me. I remember the doctor saying that he needed to put the catheter back in to get the remaining urine out of me. I freaked out and was in tears, begging him to find another way. He said something to the effect of \u201cthis could cause you urinary problems for years\u201d, but it fell on deaf ears. I was desperate. He said if I passed a certain amount of urine on my own, he wouldn\u2019t have to put the catheter in. I was able to do it (hurt like hell, but it happened). \n\nI started having stomach problems a week after the surgery. Food was pass through me, and it was always accompanied by an unbearable urge to pee immediately after and would persist for the day. It got bad enough to the point where I was referred to a physical therapist, who gave me some exercises to strengthen my bladder. It was around this time I was diagnosed with celiac (to explain the stomach problems) AND started a 7-year descent into major depression\u2014I know it\u2019s no excuse to avoid medical attention, but basically nothing mattered to me anymore. I stopped the exercises because they weren\u2019t working (more likely I was too impatient). I stopped taking care of my health altogether until a couple years back. \n\nThe frequent urination would come and go\u2014it was usually during bouts of anxiety or following sexual contact. It got harder and harder to maintain an erection during sex to the point where I got some Cialis. My erection problems got better over time (it was definitely an anxiety issue as well), but the urination would come back time after time. It got so bad that I finally saw a urologist and he recommended a Cystoscopy. I was told after the procedure that my bladder was very \u201cstretched out\u201d and was retaining larger-than-average amounts of urine. I was recommended physical therapy again, which this time I committed myself to. I could feel it working. Then, whenever I was hit with a stressful event, it felt like I went back to square one. It would take days of doing the exercises before I noticed anything, but it would always coincide with the end of my anxiety episode. No erection problems when it came to sex or masturbation. \n\nCut to a few weeks ago. Not only had the frequent urination returned, it was getting as frequent as it was after the surgery. In addition\u2014right after going off my meds\u2014I started suffering low libido and it became IMPOSSIBLE to achieve or maintain an erection. When I did, my orgasms seemed healthy enough\u2014but over time the amount of semen became less and less until it was finally gone a few days ago. Sometimes it would come back, but again, in small volumes\u2014and, for some reason, in any position except sitting upright in my bed. \n\nNow, I WAS masturbating more than usual after going off the meds, due to the initial burst in sexual energy\u2014maybe two to three times a day. When the burst ended and the sexual dysfunction came back, I kept trying to get myself off. I\u2019m aware of desensitization to porn\u2014I\u2019ve suffered from it before, and I know I\u2019m suffering from it again. I figured I was shooting blanks because of how often I was doing it. I was wrong. This has been happening even when I\u2019m masturbating once a day, or after a one or two-day break. Today, I feel this very uncomfortable feeling in my penis\u2014not pain, but the feeling that nothing I can do will give me pleasure. I have no libido whatsoever. There\u2019s some pain in my abdomen that comes and goes. \n\nI made an appointment with my urologist, but it\u2019s not until October. I\u2019m not one of those WebMd googling guys looking to scare himself. But over time I\u2019ve heard from friends and family alike that these symptoms could be from diabetes or something called retrograde ejaculation. I\u2019m at my wit\u2019s end. I already have one kid and never plan to have another, so infertility doesn\u2019t matter to me. What matters that I may never have another sexual partner due to my discomfort as not seeing anything come out of my penis. It\u2019s somehow even more important to me when I\u2019m masturbating alone. Seeing myself ejaculate is essential to the experience. \n\nI\u2019m going to the local lab and giving them a urine sample to test for any infections. I don\u2019t know what to do. I\u2019m only 34. This is not the turn of events I wanted in my life. I realize it could be worse. I could just be freaking out over nothing. But the idea that I could\u2019ve caused permanent damage from ignoring such an inconvenient health problem for so long isn\u2019t sitting with me well. Please help. Thanks."

She has smoked for about 50 years and has COPD; also her BP has been high for a long time but it is well-controlled with medication.  She takes synthroid, amlodipin, losartan, and now pravachol.  She has not had any other issues related to her heart or blood vessels.  She has a major tendency toward panic, health anxiety, depression, etc. so I feel like her PCP did not give her sufficient info about the risks or implications of having this plaque in her aorta -- she doesn't even know it's there.  My questions are, is the Rx for a statin the standard treatment for something like this,  can it reduce the size of the plaque and also what potential health problems is she at risk for because of this?  She complains of pain in her legs when walking but the doctor did not address that complaint.   I don't have a lot of faith in her PCP but she refuses to see anyone else.\n\nAlso, the 2018 CT report mentioned that the plaque was the same as was noted on her previous CT scan in August 2017.  But I looked at that report and there is no mention of a plaque.  Is that likely just an oversight by the radiologist? Thanks in advance for any insight."

After researching online, these are classic symptoms of diabetes. I'm only 23 and mildly overweight (in terms of BMI, but I personally dont consider myself overweight since I do have a good amount of muscle) so this led me to believe that it might be Type 1 diabetes. So today, after a week of excessive thirst and urination, I went to the doctor. He tested my blood glucose with one of those monitors at about 11:30 AM. I hadn't ate since about 10 PM last night, so approximately 13 hours or so. The result came back at 100. He said that I DEFINITELY (he really emphasized the \"definitely\") dont have diabetes and that I shouldnt worry. By my own research, 100 is prediabetic range. I have a few questions, and I'll number them below to make it easier for anybody who wants to help:\n1. Is he right that I shouldnt worry about a 100 blood sugar level, even after approx. 13 hours of fasting?\n2. Can anxiety raise blood sugar?\n3. Should I get a second opinion?\n4. Is there ANY possible way that somebody with diabetes (in particular Type 1) could have a fasting blood sugar of 100 without insulin in the early stages of the disease? I'm specifically scared about having type 1 because I dont want to go into DKA and die. I know that there is a \"honeymoon stage\" in Type 1 and I'm just wondering if it's possible to be Type 1 and have a 100 fasting level without insulin.\n\nThanks for any help."

Still to this day, I remember how I used to feel and I know that what I am going through is not right. Nothing happened in 2016 apart from going on holiday in July. All this started around October 2016.\n\n\nMental State:\n\nConstant brain fog, heavy headed and feel tired/fatigued. I am detached from myself and do not feel connected with my body, like looking at my arms, feels like they are not a part of me, I feel like I am in a dream and in a haze. Emotionally numb but can feel anxiety and panic with no issues at times. I can carryout daily tasks and work perfect, my mental capacity or memory is not affected and I feel sharp as I have always been and fully aware of what I am doing or what is going on in front of me. Just feel like I am in auto pilot and different from how I normally would feel. I feel like I am in a 24/7 hangover or high, not one day I have had a break from this.\n\nEyes: Constant light sensitivity (Everything is bright to my eyes and it has changed the way I view things especially in dark environments, seems that my eyes are blurry from being light sensitive) Visual snow. My eyes feel heavy and tired and bloodshot at times. Fuzzy vision.\n\nSleeping: I sleep around 10:30pm to 6am but wake up like I have only had 3 hours sleep and really heavy headed and groggy with dry mouth. I never wake up feeling refreshed, it is like I wake up with a hangover, This head space feeling doesn\u2019t go away, it is connected to the above symptoms.  I am tired all day.\n\nOn some days during the month: I feel really ill, and I mean really ill, On these really ill days, I wake up really fatigued, more so than other days and feel like I am about to come down with something but never do, I feel so ill and really really dead inside, no emotions and feel sick and I feel so tired and weak. It is like I have been hit with a virus out of nowhere overnight. I feel better the next day after sleep, but all the other symptoms like the detachment, feeling spaced out, fatigued, light sensitivity etc..  remain. I have good and bad days. But the really ill days can happen a few times a month. It is like on these really ill days, my current symptoms, are amplified to the extreme.\n\n\nBody: I do notice that quite often my neck and upper back feel so stiff and tense, It is really noticeable especially the back of my neck can be warm to the touch. Sometimes there is a shooting nerve sensation near my lower neck/upper back. My head at times feels like there is pressure in it and I get more frequent headaches and pains inside my head than I used to. I get headaches when waking up in the morning a few days a week. These headaches can vary on different sides of my brain.\n\n\nHearing: My tinnitus is so loud now and my hearing is becoming different.\n\n\nEvery day when I get home from work, I am exhausted.\n\nI was on Sertraline/Zoloft from 2009 to 2018 and tapered off completely and slowly over 1 year, with no issues but like I said I have been suffering from this unknown condition since 2016, so I would not say it is related. And coming off Zoloft has made no difference in how I feel.\n\nIt is getting worse as time goes on.\n\nI have researched online and did questionnaires and I have scored extremely high for Derealisation and Depersonalization Disorder and Lyme disease.\n\nI also was recommend to rule out parasites like Lyme and Bartonella disease and Candida.

        "reddit": "Hey y'all. Here are my stats: \n\nAge: 31\nSex: female\nHeight: 5'7\nWeight: 168\nMedications: Adderall 20mg twice daily\nAfflicted area: heart\nDuration: 1 week\nConditions: ADHD and generalized anxiety\n\n\nSo upon first glances I know that my Adderall and anxiety stand out as potential causes for heart palpitations right away. However, there are reasons for me to believe that they *might* not be the cause. Please bear with me. \n\nOver the last week I have been experiencing heart palpitations very regularly. They happen during all times of the day, often upon first waking up, and are especially bothersome at night. I'm unable to sit in certain positions or to lay on my sides or stomach because of them. I do notice a slight shortness of breath associated with them, but no pain. My heart feels \"enlarged\" and that its taking up too much space in my chest, if that makes sense. The palpitations can be quite \"hard\" at times, giving me a distinct kick. My heart distinctly \"skips a beat\". My husband says it sounds like it's stopping and then starting back up, and it causes me to try and catch my breath. The skips are random, but sometimes seem to follow a pattern of skipping the 3rd, 5th and 7th or 8th beat. My heart rate doesn't seem to be elevated usually, it's really steady and strong, just distinctly skipping. \n\nI do have an anxiety disorder. I don't take medication for it, but I do see a therapist every week. I do know the signs and symptoms of my anxiety as well as what triggers it. These palpitations happen when I'm very calm (like right now), when I'm watching TV, trying to sleep, generally things that don't cause me any anxiety. \n\nI take Adderall for ADHD. I don't abuse it at all, and my doctor says that I'm on a low dose at 20mg twice per day. I work for myself as a recording artist and when I'm not touring, I'm doing a lot of work preparing for tour. Most of this is comouter based for me. I'm in that phase right now. It's also worth noting that my sleep schedule is virtually flipped, where my days are nights and vice versa. This has been natural for me since I was about 14 (yes school was very difficult). On this schedule, I often go to sleep around 5:30AM (working until I'm actually tired) and wake up in the afternoon. Because of this, I often only take one dose of my Adderall, as I don't  want it to affect my sleep greatly. I get a normal amount of sleep, usually 7-9 hours, just at a different time of day as a \"regular\" person. \n\nI eat when I'm hungry and don't drink coffee or hardly any caffeine at all. When I'm home it's just water. At a restaurant if I want a diet coke I always order a water as well, and only drink a bit of diet coke, never a full glass. \n\nI'm mindful of my eating, don't eat junk food. I probably should be taking vitamins but I'm not. A typical day of food for me is a salad with chicken, pecans, etc, maybe two lean cuisines, a snack if I'm hungry later of whatever I fancy, usually berries of some kind. Maybe almonds. \n\nI do spend a lot of time sitting while I'm working on my laptop. When I'm home, it's hours and hours per day. Im wondering if this could be contributing to my palpitations. I usually wake up and immediately start working. It's not uncommon for me to work 15 hours or more per day, but again, it isn't physically strenuous (though I do work outside in the heat some and try to stay extra hydrated, listen to my body ,etc).\nBasically, a lot of my days are work and sleep and not much else, but that's by choice. \n\nI'd love to get some feedback about what could be causing these regular, every day, all day long palpitations. Should I be concerned or is this a common thing that usually goes away on its own?"

But the ear ache turned into a migraine around the back of my head and it lasted for days. I was almost unable to function for most of the next week. The pain fluctuated between both ears and my neck, as well. Over the course of several days, the pain moved all over my head: front, sides, everywhere. Just pinging around. \n\nOnce I made the connection that it was probably the pills, I stopped taking them. I looked up the side effects and headaches were among them. Other listed side effects that I experienced were: \n\n- my face had broken out in acne\n\n- my skin was insanely oily\n\n- i had some testicular pain \n\n- and obviously my head and neck were a mess (but a few new hairs sprouted; yippee). \n\nNow it\u2019s been 10 or 11 days since I stopped taking the pills.

Because of this, I think my throat basically fucked up and healed foot skin in the place of throat skin, or something along those lines. \n\nIt is not completely detrimental to my daily life. I only have serious episodes when I get very anxious, which is not often. Today, I got home from my cottage, which brings up a whole bunch of anxieties. This has caused my worst episode in months, and inspired me to finally seek medical advice for this strange condition I have.\n\nPlease help."

For the past couple weeks for pain: Tylenol 3 1-2 tabs 2/day as needed, Keterolac Tromethamine 10mg 4/day as needed. Also (non-prescription), I've been taking senna laxatives; 2 Senokot/day, and Anusol Plus suppositories, one after each BM.\n\nI did a FIT test as part of an annual checkup (in March 2018) and there was blood in my stool. As such, I had a colonoscopy (it took place late in 2018) which found internal hemorrhoids, polyps (biopsy showed they were not cancerous) and diverticulae. About a month or two after the colonoscopy the pain during and after bowel movements got significantly worse. Although my stool was soft, it often felt like I was passing broken glass or spiny seashells. I usually felt relief immediately after the BM but within an hour I started having anal spasms that were excruciating, making it all but impossible to sit or lie on my back.\n\nI went to see my GP and he told me I'd developed an anal fissure as well. He prescribed xylocain ointment, nitroglycerin ointment and buscopan. When I tried getting the prescriptions filled the pharmacist told me that buscopan was not available - their distributor had indicated none would be available for at least 6 months. I went to a number of other pharmacies and was told the same thing. As it turned out, my wife had had a prescription for buscopan and she didn't use all of it, so I used the remainder and it helped to reduce/eliminate the spasms. After it ran out the pain/spasms returned so I returned to my doctor, explained about the buscopan shortage and he prescribed the pinaverium (which doesn't seem to stop the spasms like the buscopan did). \n\nIn July, I woke one morning in extreme pain in my abdomen &amp; testicles. I went to the hospital and was told I had developed kidney stones. I was given Flomax (spelling?) to help pass the stones, Tylenol 4 and Toradol for the pain. During the following two weeks I managed to pass both stones (I've since seen an urologist who confirmed I no longer have stones). Before passing the stones, I noticed that the T4s and Toradol also reduced or eliminated the anal pain. Prior to this I had tried numerous NSAIDs (ibuprophen, naproxen and acetaminophen) and found that only acetaminophen had any impact, albeit minor. About 10 days back I returned to my GP and told him that the anal pain was becoming unbearable. I mentioned the relief I got from the KS pain meds.\n\nHe checked my anus, didn't mention and I forgot to ask about the fissure (so I don't know if it has healed) but he said I'd developed a rash which is probably contributing to the pain. He gave me a number of additional prescriptions including the Gabapentin. When I took the prescriptions to the pharmacist, she told me that there are adverse interactions between some and my heart meds and as such, she wouldn't fill those prescriptions. She asked what they were for, I explained and she recommended an OTC ointment normally used for athletes foot which I'm now applying twice/day (this ointment and the gabapentin I've been using for about a week).\n\nThis morning I had a BM at 0645h. As usual, although the stool appeared soft, passing it was extremely painful. Immediately afterwards I took a couple T3s and a toradol. The pain has continued (it's been 8 hours now). 4 hours after the BM I took another T3, 1x500mg acetaminophen and a toradol. I have since taken another 2 Tylenol and a toradol. The pain has dropped from 6-7/10 to about 2-3/10 but I still have difficulty sitting for more than 15 minutes at a time.\n\nLast couple things... Within the last year I changed doctors. I didn't have a problem with the previous one, but 8 years ago I moved and his office is now 20-25 miles from where I live. I don't have a specific complaint about the new GP but it seems as though he's just throwing different meds at me, effectively grasping at straws trying to figure out how to treat this and so far, nothing is really working. Oh yeah, to prevent constipation/kidney stones and other issues, I've been drinking 4-5 liters of water/day."

        "reddit": "Male, 44yrs old 5'6 145lbs, Caucasian, RUQ pain 5 months.  No recreational drugs.\n\nTwo years ago I had RUQ pain, went to a doctor to get it evaluated.  Of  course she thought it was gallstones.   Had an ultrasound and it  detected sludge in my gallbladder, but nothing else.  Everything else  looked normal according to the report.  So she referred me to have it  further evaluated, and I was setup to have a HIDA scan.  While waiting  on the scan the pain increased and it was as if I passed a gallstone (it  hurt so fricken bad and I almost went to the emergency room, but it  felt like the pressure was relieved suddenly so I figured I must have  passed a stone). Had my HIDA scan, gallbladder was functioning fine so  doctor decided it was best to leave it alone unless more problems later.   Then this last April I started having pain and some pressure again,  feels like I have something in there like a little golf ball or  something.  So I go to my doctor (diff one this time because I wasn't  happy with my last one), tell her all what has been going on, she  figures gallbladder problems.  She schedules me for an ultrasound, and,  if that comes back abnormal, CT scan too to make sure nothing is missed.   Well, US comes back that something is wrong, so they have me do the  CT.  CT scan report says my common bile duct is dilated .7cm, but no  visible stones, and liver is mildly heterogeneous which raises  possibility of hepatocellular disease, recommend MRCP to further  evaluate (tests for hepatitis are neg).  So they do an MRCP, and I  figure okay, this is it, they are going to get to the bottom of this RUQ  pain.  But no, MRCP comes back, again the common bile duct is dilated,  but this time .6cm and no stones no nothing showing up, and now they see  a tumor in my spine.  The cyst in my liver is just a cyst (also, cysts  in kidneys, and I only had one 1.5 years ago in one kidney).  RUQ pain  is not constant, but ranges in severity, and is daily.   Everything else  (gallbladder, liver, pancreas all look normal), and I had a colonoscopy  and EGD, which resulted in no significant problems.  Also had a gastric  emptying test which came back normal.  I have what they believe is   seronegative RA and it is being controlled with sulfasalazine 2 grams twice daily, plaquenil 300mg daily, and I take ibuprofen daily (also Venlafaxin daily lowest dose for now) because I have osteophytes in my  neck and knees that cause me pain and have depression.  My question is, what could it be at  this point?  I'm so frustrated, and it feels like there is no light at  the end of this tunnel.  I just need someone to give it to me straight,  and just let me know what I'm in for, or just tell me it's probably  nothing so I can just relax.  I'm so sick and tired of having to have  tests done and getting no where."

It just happened suddenly in class I felt spasms in my scalp. It\u2019s like a muscle spasm but on your scalp and it\u2019s not painful but extremely uncomfortable. Sometimes these spasms .(I call them twitches) last throughout the whole day. \n\nAt first the twitches stayed on my scalp until my senior year st high school. After I would get a twitch on my scalp my lip would twitch as a result. So now whenever I get twitches again my lips will twitch as well. And ou can actually see my lip curling and twitching by itself. I noticed that when this happens people will stare so I learned to hold it in\n\nHolding it in makes it worse. The twitches accumulate and I don\u2019t have a release. It\u2019s extremely hard for me to focus in class because of this. I have to hold it in because the teacher is in front and looking at us. I have to not let anybody see me twitching. I start fidgeting and I get even more uncomfortable. \n\nI try to get away and go to the bathroom and massage my scalp with the pads of my fingers and that is relieving for like a minute. Or I pull at my hair until the twitch finishes. This looks extremely strange so I try not to do it in front of others.\n\nI think one of the triggers is if I am uncomfortable. Like in class and I can\u2019t relieve it like I could at home. Or images of trypopphobia make it worse as well. Wearing itchy clothes also makes it worse. \n\nLike I said it makes it extremely hard to focus so sometimes I\u2019m in class and I am  not paying attention to anything the professor is saying because of the twitches. I do think this illness is stopping me from being completely comfortable. What if I\u2019m sitting in a meeting st work? Sometimes the twitches are so bad I just have to take a break lay down in bed and just let it pass. Sometimes it stops me from being able to sleep because it\u2019s so severe.\n\nI\u2019ve searched and searched online but I could never find anyone with the same symptoms as me. The closest thing I could find was benign fascilluation syndrome. And almost all of them experience something different then what i experience. I just feel like I\u2019m the only one in the world who has it and it\u2019s fristrating and I don\u2019t want to live with this for the rest of my life. I am constantly in a state of discomfort because of this and it affects my mood. Does anyone have any idea what is going on?\n\nShort version: Scalp spasms and lip spasms/twitches."

I also feel sometimes my arms get tired really easily, for example when I play guitar I used to be able to go for an hour, but today I got tired after only about 15 minutes.\n\nI've been to a doctor for a different reasons, but I told him about the muscle spasms, and I had blood work done, but nothing came up.

I am going to wait until I am back to normal and try the supplement again. If the issues reoccur I am going to stop the supplements and report to my urologist. I would really rather make dietary changes anyway.**"

        "reddit": "24M / 190lb / 6'3 / White /\n\nHey everyone! Hope someone has an idea what's going on with me. About a month ago I began taking some supplements which I thought would help with my anxiety: \n\n600mg Holy Basil\n\n600mg Alpha Lipolic Acid\\\n\n5000 iu Vitamin D\n\n300mg magnesium\n\n30mg zinc\n\n1g l-argenine\n\n1g l-lysine\n\n\nI know it was a lot to start with all of these supplements but I felt pretty desperate and hindsight is 20/20. I started feeling some really strange symptoms after two days so I halved the doses the next day then stopped. \n\nThe last day of taking them my throat closed up hard, which I think was an allergic reaction to the holy basil. \n\nSince then, I've had random pains and joint aches almost everywhere in my body. It started with this weird pain in my feet when I woke up every morning. But that's gone now.\n\nMy knees are sometimes incredibly stiff and take some movement to loosen up.\nI have random muscle aches in my bicep, forearms, calves, shin, and entire leg. Also, rarely in my abdomen, glutei, or shoulders. Sometimes the pain is about the size of a pencil eraser and lasts a few seconds. Sometimes it aches all day.\nIf I flex these muscles it aches even more, but if I lift weights on them it seems to help for the rest of the day.\nI have joint pain in the middle of my hands, knees, ankles, and wrists; and skin level pain in my hands/wrists. When I play video games or code, this hand and wrist pain is always exacerbated for hours. \n\nThe symptoms also move around a lot, they're very unpredictable! This pain is really stressing me out and making me feel like I can't accomplish a lot of normal things (painting a house for a few hours was unbelievably uncomfortable when it would have usually been fun and relaxing.)\n\nI had blood work come back normal. I'm a little sick with a very sore throat right now but it came about 2 weeks after my initial symptoms. Also, I lost a lot of weight in the last two months! Gonna see my doctor for a followup tomorrow. \n\nAny advice would be amazingly appreciated."

Over a year ago while I was in Ireland I developed severe abdominal pain. after a week this subsided into just uncomfortable pressure and occasional pain. I had an initial ultrasound showing splenomegaly and dilated portal vein. Follow up CT 2 months later (to rule out viral infection) showed spleen of 17.9 cm. I had a repeat CT one year later (june 2019) that showed it was the exact same size. 17.9 cm and 1.1 L in volume. I also had a special liver ultrasound to check for cirrhosis; there was none. My blood work is almost always normal. I sometimes have a bilirubin of 1.5-1.8 then is normal on recheck 2 weeks later. I have to take zofran almost daily for the nausea, I can\u2019t eat very much or sleep on my right side at all. I\u2019ve been to a GI doc and I have a hem/onc appointment in a month but the nausea and pain is so bothersome. I had mono about 10 years ago but my EBV labs were all normal recently and I never had an issue with my spleen until one year ago. Anyone know what might be causing this? I drink maybe once a month and don\u2019t use any drugs. I have depression so I take Wellbutrin and Buspar for this. Also have a vitamin D deficiency but it has been recovering with 50000 D units weekly."

As a pharmacy technician, when I type a tizanidine script, I always get a third party reject asking me to check the dosage form due to differing absorption rates between tablet and capsule and I have to override it before it proceeds to pharmacist review. I\u2019m not sure they were aware of which dosage form he took but I am curious if it may have factored in. \n\nAfter he stopped breathing, he was intubated, transferred to ICU, and sedated (sedative unknown to me) and will not be awoken until they\u2019re sure he has cleared the tizanidine from his system. I welcome any thoughts regarding this."

It seems a few minutes to a few hours after using a THC:CBD 1:1 cartridge with a vape pen, I am having what I can only guess is an asthma attack.  Breathing becomes very laborious and wheezy, coughing feels like there is mucous in my lungs but is only nominally productive, enough to have the taste of blood in my mouth.  Symptoms seem to last from 3-6 hours from onset (not from using the THC)\n\nThe variance between the delay being a few minutes and a few hours seems directly correlated to how large of breaths I take when using the pen.  Large, deep breaths make it happen much more quickly.\n\nIs this an asthma attack? Would an inhaler (Albuterol) Work to treat this?  Could this be a symptom of a larger problem?"

I\u2019ve tried different types of otc lubes and condoms that are supposed to increase sensitivity and it just feels kind of cold, no help.

It seems the combo of being on olanzipine and being off weed makes me totally numb. Wtf?\n\nAnyone have experience with this and gotten better somehow? I am scared to go off olanzipine because last time I tried I had terrible intrusive thoughts.

At first onset pain was mostly thoracic radiating to sternal/substernal pain and abdominal pain... Feeling of fullness / bloating like need to belch but couldn't. Abdominal pain fullness causes me to not tolerate conpression of abdomen unconfortable to slouch over. So bad at times I basically stay straight or even slightly hyperextended. Don't tolerate tight/restrictive clothing. Pain is much better at tines just kind of what I would describe as arthritic pain/aching/tightness/stiffness but usually only several hours into the day up an on my feet it gets worse. After all this time in pain I can have severe anxiety / panic attacks without massive pain. Usually back pain improves with laying down flat on my back after several hours. However axiety can still remain. I lay awake worrying about every little pain, muscle twitch, heatbeat ...etc. Also back pain if thorasic pain gets improves pain can get worse in lower back as in spine or top of buttocks/ top of hip bones. Have had lower abdominal pain right above pelvic region / pelvic area / inguinal and even testicular pain. After so much resting and doing very little physical exercise that gets heartrate up I can barely stand an elevated heart rate. \"Physical intimacy\" with ne doing little if any physical activity caused me to feel flushed and uncomfortable from the activity. \n\nDuration: \nFirst seeked medial care approximately around end of November last year. \n\nMedical history:\nHad multiple stomach issues as child, testing done but I'm not sure what all but do believe maybe a barium swallow was part of it.

No surgry required or recommended. Explained to me very poor outcomes from surgery to this area.\n\nReferred to neuro pain specialist ... MD seen now awaiting some generalized injections to surrounding back muscles and perhaps eventually direct injection if needed. \n\nThoughts on any all of it? Test could / should ask about about being done?\nSomeone I'm not sure who but i dont think it was cardiologist said may need CTA or MRA. With backpain and trying to compensate could I be forming a hernia? Abdominal muscles hurt often and can feel painful tight knots at times. Even wondered about separation of abdominal muscles that is frequentl in pregnant females. MRI that was ordered for thoracic and lumbar spine do they look at other structures in thorasic and abdomen regions when those (spine regions are reason for test) are specified"

It was in one localized spot (where that one prominent dot is on the right side of my glans in today's pictures), but with anti fungal cream I was able to 99.9% clear it up within a few days. That was the end of the story, or so I thought.\n\nA little over a month ago, after breaking up with my ex, I noticed the spot seeming to return, so I started applying anti fungal cream again, but this time it didn't seem to have much of an effect. The spot continued to become more prominent, and this is what it looked like during late July (https://imgur.com/a/ZTUJ3u7).\n\nKeep in mind I have had no new sexual partners since I broke up with my ex. I was also got screened for everything after we broke up just to confirm that I am STI-free.\n\nAnyways, something happened to me at the end of July, and for the life of me I cannot pinpoint why. I began having intense pains/itchiness all through my urethra and chaffing/sensitivity on my glans tip/lips. Urinating became painful and my whole genital region, specifically all through my urethra, felt very tender and achy. I was also experiencing some sticky, clear discharge at the end of my urination. While all of this was happening, my lymph nodes (mainly around my neck) began going crazy and I felt very fatigued with whole body muscle soreness. I also began developing painful canker sores all over the sides and bottom of my tongue. My gums also felt very sore. I didn't have any fever, sore throat, or congestion. I didn't feel like I was sick, it just felt like my body was putting all of it's energy into fighting whatever was going on with my dick. It basically felt like my immune system was hardly functioning.\n\n My whole shaft, balls, and specifically glans became very sticky and shiny through this week, and would dry/crack/flake when dried off (such as if I put my unit in front of a fan). From these problems I was able to assume I had something fungal related again and began applying crazy amounts of antifungal cream all over the region. This did seem to resolve the symptoms with my dick. While this all happened I scheduled a doctor's appointment through our uni health center, although I had to wait a few days for it.\n\nMy weird sickness flu-ish subsided, my tongue/mouth returned to normal, and the stickiness/shininess/flakiness resolved from the antifungal cream. However what had come back was the irritation on the urethral opening, urethral pain/itchiness/general unease, and the spot seen in the July picture. When I went to my doctor's appointment my doc told me to not worry about the spot, and that it was just \"me\", and that he thought my issues were not fungal related. I trusted his word and was on my way. I wasn't really having the problems with urethral pain/discomfort anymore during this visit so that didn't play a factor for the symptoms I was describing.\n\nHowever, my problems came back seemingly right after that visit, and I went back to the health center about 10 days ago. I was diagnosed with urethritis. I was given some antibiotics for it and was told to change all my detergents and to stop using soaps just in case. Since then, none of my symptoms have changed. In fact, they've just gotten worse. The general pain and weird feeling in my urethra is still there, as well as the sensitivity on the tip opening. I still get some weird discharge too. What's worse and even more concerning, is now the blotchiness on my glans that I was told to not worry about has spread and morphed at an alarming rate. The appearance of my glans seems to change every day. Some parts become more red, some parts become less pigmented as if it's getting less blood flow. I don't know what the hell to think of it, but it certainly can't be healthy. And meanwhile, I've been pushing away girl after girl because I am HORRIFIED to do anything sexual with any girl given the current condition of my dick. And of course I'm still horny, but I can forget about masturbation. If I even as much as stroke my dick once it causes everything to break out in irritation again and makes everything way more painful than it already is.\n\nI have been trying to have hope and have listened to my doctor but I can't help but notice that it's looking worse by the day. I still have very weird sensations in my urethra and although I've been told that the complexion is \"within normal range\", what's most important to realize is that my dick looked NOTHING like this ~2 months ago. The prominent spot was negligibly noticeable, and everything else was healthy coloring/pigmentation. Now I don't even recognize my dick anymore. It has me very worried and I am extremely anxious about it all the time, and I feel like I have reason to be. \n\nWhat's interesting to note is that if I take a bath, it causes the coloring to return to almost normal for around 5 minutes, but it doesn't take long for it to return to how you see it now.\n\nHas anyone seen anything like this in their life? I'm at a loss and it's truly exhausting trying to \"have hope\" when things get worse every day. I'm at my wits' end and do not know what to do or who to turn to. I have spent so much money on antifungal creams, coconut oil, lotions, steroid creams, anything to help my current state. I'm going back to the health center next week, but I really have no idea where to turn, which is why I am here.\n\nIf anyone can save my penis, please give me any advice. It's really taking a toll on my mental health. I'm very worried about my future."

        "reddit": "Age: 18\nSex: Female\nWeight: 119lbs\nHeight: 5\u20193ft \nRace: Hispanic/White\nPrimary complaint: Painful urination around vaginal opening \nDuration: ~2 years\nExisting Medical Issues: Rheumatoid arthritis, chronic migraine, possible IBS? \nNo current medications, although I smoke marijuana on occasion. I drink too. \nLocation: Vagina/vaginal opening\n\nI\u2019m at my wits end. I\u2019m currently sitting in the shower while typing this, because it\u2019s close enough to the toilet if I need it and the water makes me feel better. It hurts to pee. \n\nIt all started around two years ago during my junior year of high school. I remember just waking up one night having to pee. I went to the bathroom and went back to bed. I remember laying there and having to pee again, so I got back up and went to the bathroom, except the second time it burned. I remember just sitting on the toilet all night, tinkling on occasion, plagued with this burning around my vaginal opening. I even brought a pillow in there to try and sleep. I spent most of the next morning in the nurse\u2019s office, in her bathroom, until I eventually got sent home and repeated the whole night all over again. \n\nI ended up going to the doctor for a UTI. She gave me antibiotics, but they didn\u2019t help and a couple of days later the results came up clear anyway. The pain had stopped by the second day, and I thought maybe I had just gotten some soap in there or something. I was wrong. Over the next couple of months it happened frequently, causing me to miss multiple days of school. I was tested for STD\u2019s, UTI\u2019s, and even kidney/bladder infections. Everything. Came. Back. Clear. \n\nSo that\u2019s practically how it goes ever since it first started. It doesn\u2019t happen all the time. When it does, I have the urge to pee, and then I\u2019ll have the urge to pee AGAIN, except it\u2019s usually accompanied by crippling burning that leaves me unable to stand still for more than 30 seconds. Sometimes, if I\u2019m lucky, I can feel it just minor enough the first time I go to the toilet so that I can remind myself not to go again for a couple of hours or else I\u2019ll end up stuck. \n\nI\u2019ve tried multiple times to rule out the possibilities. When this first started happening, I had just gotten my ACL surgery and was taking multiple pain medications. At first I thought it was aspirin or something, but as time went on and I kept getting these weird flare ups of Satan-urination, I noticed that there were times where I hadn\u2019t taken anything at all similar to a pain killer(or any medication, really) and I\u2019d still experience the pain. \n\nNow I\u2019m dumb struck. They don\u2019t happen as often anymore, but when they do, I\u2019m practically debilitated. It\u2019s 7AM now, I\u2019ve been in the bathroom since 3AM. I have work in a couple hours. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll be able to stay still. Not only does it cause a major disturbance to my day, but it HURTS! It\u2019s just around the opening of my vagina, too. I do feel minor cramps sometimes if it goes on for a while, and it leaves me feeling exhausted. I\u2019ve peed blood once while it was happening and never again. \n\nDoctors don\u2019t take me seriously anymore. They just shrug their shoulders. I don\u2019t blame them, what else can they do? I\u2019ve had ultrasounds and visual exams done. I\u2019m losing my mind googling possible solutions to my problem and never coming up with any. I don\u2019t have any other symptoms that match any other illnesses. It just hurts to pee and that\u2019s it. Taking pain meds don\u2019t work. The only way it goes away is if I fall asleep and forget about it. What\u2019s wrong with me?"

ER said I was fine basically and just sent me home saying it was the flu or something I needed a GP for. \n\nI found a GP, and was told again that I had tonsillitis, and was given another dose of Amoxicillin, this time a stronger and longer dosage. Amoxicillin didn\u2019t help, my symptoms worsened so I returned to that same GP after finishing the medication (about a week later) and was told to take cough syrup? \n\nI left that doctor and found a new one who wasn\u2019t so dismissive and he sent me to get all sorts of blood work done, coming from a family history of auto immune diseases I was tested for all of that but the only thing that came back positive was the Epstein Barr virus. \n\nHowever, I would like to add that in between waiting for blood work results I was sent to the ER for a second time because I experienced really bad shortness of breath and almost passed out. They said it was just anxiety and once again I was just told it was Tonsillitis. \n\nAfter speaking to my doctor about the results of the bloodwork, I was put on a \u201cZ-pack\u201d of azithromycin for a week as well as 1GM of Valacyclovir twice a day. He also suggested I get some more chest x-rays to make sure I didn\u2019t get pneumonia. The same day I started taking the Z pack I felt 100 times better, I went back to work, started a new job, and thought everything was fine for 2 weeks after I finished it until I noticed that my right tonsil was still pretty inflamed. I don\u2019t think it ever really went away. The day after I noticed that, it was covered in white spots, then the day after that my fever had returned again, I had a horrible headache, stiff neck, malaise, lower back pain, and most of these symptoms wouldn\u2019t go away even with prescription grade ibuprofen. \n\nI called my doctor and went in the next day, he sent me to the ER immediately because he suspected that I had meningitis. The ER doctor was super dismissive, argued with me about my symptoms, and tried to talk me out of getting the test, \n\nI got it regardless, and thankfully it was negative. However I still feel just as sick as I did before. It\u2019s been 3 months of feeling like this on and off and no one has answers and I\u2019m just getting worse.  In total I\u2019ve been given 3 courses of antibiotics and 3 courses of steroids, nothing is fully getting rid of it. Any advice with anyone who has experienced anything similar? Or any steps I should take to figure out what\u2019s going on? \nThank you!"

How it works is I often feel a slight pressure in my throat and using my throat muscles, I can relieve that pressure by forcing myself to throw up a small amount into my mouth. Sometimes it\u2019s just liquid, but most of the time, it\u2019s food that either I had eaten recently (indistinguishable from food just being chewed up) or even food that is slightly soured from being in my stomach for a period of time. I almost never spit out the throw up, opting instead to just swallow it.\n\nI\u2019ve done this since I was a kid. I\u2019m not sure how long I\u2019ve done it, but I don\u2019t remember it ever suddenly coming on. I have a distinct memory of going on a road trip when I was ten and throwing up a partially dissolved cold medicine pill and having that AWFUL taste in my mouth for most of the car ride, so I\u2019ve at least been doing it for that long. It happens to me several times a day, oftentimes more. I notice it happens more after eating a large meal or feeling full. I get really embarrassed thinking about it and often worry that other people can tell I\u2019m doing it.\n\nDespite being embarrassed, I\u2019ve recently brought this up to my gp, and she says that it\u2019s nothing to worry about and possibly a result of acid reflux. But I don\u2019t usually have heartburn or acid when the throwing up happens? It just kind of happens. It feels gross whenever I do it, but not painful or acidic. She recommended taking an antacid, but I haven\u2019t seen any improvements.\n\nI have severe ocd and paranoia, and my therapist worries the throwing up could potentially be eating disorder related, which makes sense bc I\u2019ve always had a weird relationship with food. But when I make myself throw up, it feels more like it\u2019s out of habit than anything else? Like I feel the pressure in my throat, time to throw up, maybe chew, swallow. I\u2019m grossing myself out just by talking about it, but there isn\u2019t like, a conscious need for me to eliminate my food? Like I\u2019m re-swallowing it, not trying to get rid of it. It just kind of happens without me thinking about it until it\u2019s already been done.\n\nI always HAVE to make sure I have those mini toothbrushes, mints, gum, breath spray, anything in my purse that could mask the fact I just threw up in my mouth bc I work around people a lot. The only people that know about it are my gp and therapist.\n\nI have a lot of weird food allergies (poultry, fish, seafood), but I can\u2019t imagine that would be related.\n\nI\u2019m not really sure what I\u2019m after asking about it really, but I\u2019m worried there could be some underlying health issues or physical effects of making oneself throw up like that (like weakened throat muscles and bad teeth).  But it\u2019s distressing at the very least bc I feel very grossed out whenever it happens and worry other people notice I\u2019m doing it (plus it\u2019s not like enjoyable in any way? It almost always tastes bad, feels weird, there\u2019s nothing compelling me to WANT to do it other than the pressure in my throat)."

I don't smoke and only drink on social situations.\n\nI'm trying to find the reasons for my anxiety associated problem, where I have difficulty eating in public/with friends. It does have a psychological (mental) side to it,  but I think theres a physiological (body) reaction side, thats aggravating it or triggering it.\n\nSymptoms during an anxiety attack:\n\nI get dry mouth (there's basically no saliva), and a sense of fullness at the throat. I try to eat but I can't, chewing the mouth without saliva gets impossible, and food tastes like nothing. I end up eating VERY little, and drinking liquid much more because of dryness.\n\nProblems is that after such event, I feel no hunger at all for the rest of the day (sometimes even the next day). I can feel my stomatch kind of empty, but at the same time there's no hunger. Even if I'm totally calm, there's no saliva and it even feels \"dry\" the foods I swallow, so I end up eating much less. \n\nThat same dryness and no saliva triggers my anxiety: since I can't eat, I try to hurry and eat, but I can't and feel ashamed in front of my colleagues.\n\nI have some ideas of culprits (on the physiological aspect):\n\n\\- Tongue: I do have a white tongue, mostly on the far back. Not too much, but even though I brush, it's still whiteish. I took a picture on how it usually looks (somestimes it get worse). Is it affecting the taste on the food? \n\n  [https://imgur.com/a/Gf4WcJd](https://imgur.com/a/Gf4WcJd) \n\n\\- Rhinitis: I have rhinitis and desviated septum. I don't have a reference, but I think my nose isn't too good for smelling food.

        "reddit": "Hi all. So I (21F, 5\u201d2, 135 lbs, white) have been medicated for depression, anxiety, and bipolar 2  for the last 7 or so years (and ADHD since I was in 2nd grade). I\u2019m currently on 100mg of Lamotrigine, 2mg of Guanfacine, and 10mg of Adderall XR. \n\nLast November I withdrew from college due to a suicidal depressive episode. At the time, I was on Abilify, Prozac, and Daytrana, and had been on essentially the same doses since 2013. I don\u2019t recall anxiety ever being a major complaint, aside from occasional panic attacks that were mostly mediated with situational self-care, not additional medication. However, once I got home to see my psychiatrist, he started me on Lamotrigine and Adderall. Since then, I\u2019ve had much more trouble controlling both my anxiety and depression, and have cycled through multiple medications *with* the Lamotrigine: Clonezepam, Latuda, and Seroquel . \n\nObviously, some of my mood swings are due to my current situation (living at home with little to no social interaction, going through a recovery process involving therapy), but I\u2019ve noticed that within the last few months especially, I get anxiety much more easily than ever in my life. Daily, I get panic attacks that range from mild to severe, but they all involve a feeling of extreme restlessness and aggressive depression, unlike anything I\u2019ve ever experienced. Obviously I had anxiety before I started the new meds, but these attacks have gotten worse since June or so, and are crippling daily tasks, like going to work. I\u2019m still in therapy and constantly practice mindfulness and other DBT coping mechanisms, but they basically do nothing to stop this anxiety, which usually isn\u2019t even situational (I.e. it happens basically at random and without a specific event to provoke it).\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that since my initial meds change in November, I\u2019ve been experiencing huge improvement in my mood overall, so this fairly recent change is worrisome. I\u2019m pretty sure I can pinpoint the general start of this anxiety to after I started taking Lamotrigine back in November, but does anyone have any other guesses? Could the anxiety be related to the medications at all? I\u2019m starting to think I should just go back to Abilify, since anxiety was never an issue while I was taking it. Thanks in advance."

I'm trying to do the best I can on my own now, but it's a difficult process, and I'd really appreciate any advice.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe biggest component of my anxiety is a general fear of the unknown. I see my doctor every three months for a variety of issues, but most of them are an ongoing thing that may never fully be resolved. My doctors can't point to any tests and definitively say \"this is what you have.\" It's usually things like \"your symptoms are commonly this, try this medication for a month and come back if it doesn't help.\" I'm sure this is all well and good due to the complex nature of health issues, but I often feel like I'm running blind. I worry that one day an existing problem will suddenly get worse and my doctor will say \"It turns out that it was cancer all along. It was treatable two years ago, but now you've got a week to live. Sorry about that.\" A diagnosis of exclusion, such as IBS, is incredibly difficult for me; any time a symptom pops up, it could indicate an underlying issue with the gallbladder, liver, pancreas, etc or could also just be absolutely nothing, possibly even psychological in nature. When I look at my symptoms, I often have questions like; \"Am I tolerating a symptom at home that a normal person might consider a medical emergency, or would a normal person not pay it much attention at all?\" I lack context on the severity of most of my symptoms. My doctors are generally quite busy, and I leave with a lot of unanswered questions because of the short time slots, but realize that every patient gets the same amount of time. I have a great relationship with my doctors and don't blame them for anything.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOccasionally I'll have a few days in a row where I feel better than usual, and others where I'll feel worse.

I saw a therapist who seemed to try to steer my own self-analysis by asking thought provoking questions, but was entirely unable to get me to process anything that I hadn't already spent many hours asking myself privately.

I'm broke and struggling and its a lot of money to me! So, if you have any suggestions to help my doctor take this more seriously and maybe order more tests, please do let me know.  \n\n\n# About me:\n\n* **29F**\n* **64kg / 141lb**\n* **160cm / 5\"2**\n* **White**\n* **Australia**\n* **Non-smoker**\n* **Fairly unfit**, bit of a couch potato despite my size\n* **Current medications;** oral contraceptive (**LevlenED**); lukotriene inhibitor for very mild asthma and allergies (**Silgulair 10mg daily**); central nervous system stimulant for ADHD (**Vyvanse 30mg daily**), which I haven't been taking because I've been recovering from a chest infection (all cleared up a week ago) and needed extra sleep.\n* Enjoy long walks on the beach....\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# About the owies:\n\n* **Localised pain from left side of ribs to left side of sternum (pain scale 2)**, very slight swelling under the arm, area is **tender to pressure (pain scale 3)**, back muscles under shoulder blade feel cramp-like strain\n* **Duration 1 week, started** ***just*** **as I fully recovered from severe chest infection**, pain has increased and decreased over that period a few times and **doesn't seem to be improving**\n* **Laying down seems to make it worse**, no matter what position or how many pillows, while **sitting up unsupported brings no pain**\n* **Coughing, sneezing, sharp inhalation, using certain muscles in left arm and back brings a sharp stabbing pain in the area (pain scale 5).**  This is a more pinpointed pain than the dull aching i get while laying down, like its all in one place, but its too hard to tell if its my lung, heart or random tissue I know nothing about!\n* **Pain came on without injury to the area.

This infection was so severe I checked myself into hospital because I was so **breathless**, I couldn't get more than 2 or 3 words out without a breath in between. Had **x-ray** at hospital and a **blob showed up**, told its most likely chest infection, given antibiotics (**amoxycillin 7 day course 500mg**), nothing can do about breathlessness, **blood oxygen levels fine**, sent home. \n* **Previously fractured a rib from coughing when I was 17. Left side,** similar location but no pain near sternum.\n* **Been to two different GPs**, first one said its likely fractured and not to worry about an x-ray (fair enough since theres no treatment available for rib injuries anyway), just rest. **He listened to my breathing through a stethoscope and said he could hear wheezing, but my lungs feel clear** for the first time in weeks. He also prodded my ribs and asked if it hurt to do certain things. Second GP **ordered** **x-ray, which** **showed no fractures**, then told me its probably caused by stress and to come back in 3 weeks when she got back from holidays. Also advised me to take Ibuprofen for pain, but I don't think that's necessary as I prefer to avoid pain medication unless I really need it. I asked her if I should be taking it easy, if i can lift things, and she just said, and I quote, *\"do what you want\"*.\n* **Rest**\n* Another appointment booked with a different GP to chase down diagnosis\n* **Gentle back massage** with fisiocrem (arnica, hypericum, calendula) from my BF who knows a little about massage therapy, felt like it was really helping at the time, but the next day there was **no improvement**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Questions:\n\n1. **Any idea what's going on??** I realise its not easy or accurate to try to diagnose something over the internet, but at this point I would really appreciate any and all opinions and advice. \n2. **Should I be resting or not? Should I be worried?** Given that the pain levels are tolerable and I no longer feel short of breath, I'm not too worried, except when I cough and it feels like stabbing pain characteristic of a heart attack of course... \n3. **What can I do/say to get my doctors to treat this seriously? What tests could I request?** Especially this one. I feel like because I look quite young, docs forget I'm 29 and because I look fit and healthy, they assume I am, but I'm really not. I am really concerned by the response (or lack thereof) I have had from both general practitioners and the hospital staff so far and really need to know what's happening. I hate to criticise professionals, but I know its not all in my head, even if the swelling is so slight you can only see and feel it by comparing the two sides, I know my body and something is wrong here. \n4. **I'm going camping over the weekend....** I assume I definitely shouldn't be lifting camping gear and pitching tents on my own? Asking this question hoping I get a bunch of \"nah she'll be right\"s like my previous doctor said, even though that goes against every fibre in my body...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n    I just want to thank the reddit community, AskDocs mods, and all the docs and students on this sub!"

Never had any issues with panic attacks. I was doing research and lead myself to some research articles that study the effects of blood sugar on the body and changes in it. I read something that said that symptoms of sharp drop in blood sugar are nearly indistinguishable from those of a panic attack. So I decided to go back and look at some old medical records and glucose blood tests. My last fasting blood glucose test was 114 , and the last time I was in the ER for a really bad panic attack it was 133, approx 4 hours after a small meal. I am aware that these are consistent with prediabetes but I guess what im asking is how worried should I be. My doctor never called me to address the \\*H\\* marked next to my glucose level. I drink a lot of water but its because i get kidney stones if I don't. I pee a normal amount of times daily. I get shaky all the time and sweaty. I've even gone as far as ordering a lancing kit to test my glucose to ensure I am not actually diabetic, (might just be the anxiety). My biggest fear is being misdiagnosed with panic disorder and actually i've just been living with diabetes this whole damn time. I know how dumb I sound but Im serious, I am genuinely worried that I may have low or high blood sugar sometimes.\n\nI also am not good with eating. I usually average around 1000 calories a day and am working on eating more to actually sustain myself physically. \n\nThanks for any help."

Sometimes it\u2019s just the feeling like I\u2019m spinning feeling, usually when I\u2019m sitting or lying down. But lately the most bothersome symptom is it will feel like the floor is dropping, while I\u2019m standing. Like I\u2019m in an elevator.  It also feels like the ground will be bouncing up and down while walking. Sometimes it just feels like I\u2019m floating around. This gives me a lot of anxiety and it\u2019s really difficult to go to work.  I feel off-balance as well, have difficulty reading/focusing. \nI had a bout of vertigo when I was a kid, that would only happen when I lied down to go to bed.  It went away after a few months, but would occasionally come back every now and then. I never got any treatment for it, since when I was growing up we never had health insurance and my mom didn\u2019t want to take us to any doctors.  \nNot sure if that episode is related but this time it does feel different.  I do get occasional ear ringing, and occasionally, but not often, it\u2019s like my ear will start \u201cclicking \u201c.  It\u2019s not just a sound but I can feel it \u201cclicking\u201d as well.  There was a day recently where my ear felt achey, but it was very brief, and I haven\u2019t had much pain at all.  Not sure if it could be an ear infection if I\u2019m not having much pain?  I haven\u2019t noticed any bloody discharge.  Only a small amount of kind of liquidy wax that was bright orangeish out of my left ear but it was a small amount. \n\nI\u2019m planning on seeing a doctor about it.  Im wondering if this is something I could just go to an urgent care for to get taken care of because it\u2019s pretty annoying, and waiting weeks for an appointment would really suck. Any advice is appreciated, thanks."

Feels like the top of the breath is cut off, there is air hunger. No other symptoms; no dizziness, fatigue, blueness of fingers or hands, tingling, fainting, high heart rate, high or low blood pressure, nothing. All stats are normal. Am able to get a good satisfying breath every few minutes once symptoms onset, and I often forget about them for a few minutes at a time, at which point I have no idea if shortness of breath continues.\n\nTests done:\n\nECG: normal\n\nDaily pulse, oximeter readings: within normal ranges, even while symptoms occur.\n\nChest x-ray: shows moderate pectus deformity, mixed type (currarino-silverman). Front xray view looks normal and healthy, lateral x-ray view shows protrusion at high chest area, depression in lower chest area. Deepest point is right where heart sits. \n\nSmoking history: smoked 1-2 packs a day from age 16/17 to 21/22 (can't remember exactly). Smoked weed during most of 20s. Smoked vaporized weed (vape pen and natural vaping device (magic flight)) starting a year or two ago until several months ago. Did have some intense coughing and lung pain from vaping. Also some short periods of \"choking\"/gagging (hard to describe) until drinking water (lasted all of a minute or two each time). Stopped smoking a week and a half ago.\n\nAdditional details: I first noticed shortness of breath a year or two ago. It would happen usually after I smoked weed. I sometimes also had panic attacks, so I attributed the shortness of breath to anxiety. I've been seeing a therapist for this for a year, though symptoms haven't improved. In this last month it's bad enough that I had gone to emergency room once out of panic. \n\nLastly, I'm awaiting comprehensive pulmonary function testing next Thursday the 5th. \n\nAny theories as to what the cause of this may be? Thanks for reading and any responses are welcome!"

        "reddit": "Female, 22, no health issues.\nSo this all began about 4-5 months ago. Mild fatigue and an intolerance to the cold (sometimes I could not swim in 100 degree dry heat due to the pool being too cold). About a month ago the fatigue got worse, and I began to fall asleep while driving because I was so tired. This is especially dangerous as part of my job is driving clients with disabilities. I saw my PCP who sent me for thyroid blood tests, and they all came back normal. Well that is kinda complicated in a way as my TPO was 16, the range being under 9, but doing some research I found that a thyroid issue is not usually seen unless it's at least 35. About a week ago I started getting heart palpitations, chest pain, shortness of breath, weakness in my legs, and diarrhea. I would say this could be anxiety, but I used to deal with panic attacks quite often and this feels totally different. Not anxious, and it happens about 10-15 times a day I would guess. It is worse by me being at work pushing around clients in wheelchairs, and walking up the stairs to my apartment. My legs get so weak and painful, and I cannot breathe by the time I get to my door. The thing is that the stairs are not even long! This has been going on for about 1 1/2 weeks now and is getting worse. A similar situation happened to me a little over a year ago, but less severe. That time I was sent to a neurologist and did tests to see if I had seizures. To this day still do not understand what my PCP was thinking as I have no history of seizures, not even family history. Total waste of time and money, but these two instances mat be connected. Anyways, I made another appointment with my PCP, but who knows what will happen."

He had a sleep study done, he has sleep apnea, he got a CPAP.\n\nWell it kinda helped, he felt a little more alert but it kept pumping air into his stomach.

He was in police academy in 2017, he places a lot of value in his physical health. \n\nHe had double jaw surgery, a bone spur removed from his nose and his tongue moved 19 mm forward in early May of this year. He slept all the time for the first few weeks, but he was hopeful and said he felt more rested than usual. Unfortunately he was eating, but couldn't find enough calories to keep his bulk, so he's now 160 lbs, hasn't been able to work out since before his surgery and he's still not getting rested from sleep.\n\nThey did a test to see if it was sleep apnea and they said it's not anymore. He tried RLS medication and said it worsened the quality of his sleep. He tried the CPAP again and it still pumps air into his stomach. I've tried making him sleep on his side. \n\nWe don't know what else it could be. I'm worried for him, he's tired all the time, I've had to pick him up from work some days because it's not safe for him to be driving like this. He's frustrated and I'm scared. \n\nSide note: We don't believe it's his depression because he still wants to do things and still enjoys activities when he's able to do them. He's frustrated, and said when he was depressed, he disassociated and didn't care. \n\nWe've tried to think of anything that changed around the time this started hitting him and we can't think of any changes."

On the goddamn nipple, of all places. Took it off smoothly, asked our general practitioner (Doctor 1) what to do, she said just sit tight and monitor for symptoms, since there's no way the disease would show up in early bloodwork.\n\nGF didn't have any symptoms. No red rash circle. Just a little - maybe half an inch wide - red-ish bump at the bite spot for a few weeks, but no rash (sorry, didn't get a pick, it's long gone now). Doctor 1 looked at the bump and didn't identify it as a rash, intensive googling indicated that a bump after a bite is normal and that there is quite a difference between a post-bite bump and the real \"bullseye\" rash of lyme disease.\n\nEither way, we waited for one and a half month. There were no symptoms, other than a headache for two days or so, but we didn't make much of it since GF has had periodic migraines for all of her life.\n\nWe did bloodwork test two days ago.\n\nBorrelia burgdorferi IgM tested 18.2 AU/mL (indicated norm is &lt;18, so just slightly more) and IgG tested 80 AU/mL (indicated norm is &lt;10, so eight times the norm).\n\nNurse of Doctor 1 told that it looks like GF's immune system beat the disease, which at the time sounded weird, because I've never heard of someone beating Lyme disease on his own. I thought you mostly needed antibiotic intervention to cure it. She said that IgM relates to the current disease activity or something and IgG notes of post-disease recovery? I don't know.\n\nAfter GF got to Doctor 1, she said that with such bloodwork results nobody would put my GF on antibiotics and she also thought that GF went through the disease by herself and that since she's had no symptoms, she doesn't think we should use antibiotics. GF agreed and said that she doesnt quite wish to nuke her immune system with antibiotics.\n\nAll of this didn't sit too well with me, especially knowing how serious Lyme disease can get, how it's hard to treat once it's been there for years, but easy to treat in the early stages, so I asked GF to get a second opinion. Doctor 1 didn't leave me an impression of absolute trust.\n\nDoctor 2 was from an infectology center and he had the opinion that my GF never even had the disease. To my question if a person can beat a Lyme disease on its own he conclusively said \"no way\" and then explained that bloodwork results regarding Lyme disease are highly unreliable and since there were no symptoms, he doubts GF ever had Lyme. He couldn't quite explain in laymans terms why would a bloodwork test still indicate the disease as positive if a person has never had it and he suggested that there is a second type of test that can be done to verify the disease, but it's really expensive and not covered by state healthcare and since GF has had no symptoms, we're thinking if we should drop such money on such test.\n\nCan any doctor here give a third input on Doctor 1 and Doctor 2 thoughts and Lyme disease in general and what we should do?"

For about 6 years.\n\nSorry the story is very long:\n\nSince I was about 15 I started having yeast infections and vaginal problems. First time it was just itchy around the vulva so I got some cream and it stopped. Next time it was when I was about 16 and about to go for a school trip. So it was very itchy and burny. So I got nystatinum vaginal tablets and some natamycin cream. It pretty much cured all the symptoms but after I was done with treatment the itchiness would come back. I got a lab test and it showed candida albicans. So I went to gynecologist and got prescribed natamycin cream and natamycin vaginal tablets. And probiotics afterwards. The infections kept on coming back. One time it was a different yeast strain. The other I also had ear yeast infection on top of vaginal one. That's when I got better treatment with higher dose of fluconazol. And cream and regular vaginal antifungals and probiotics always on top of that. After that my infection stopped but the itchiness never went away. Almost every day a few times per day I'd feel quite itchy down there. So I decided to go off sugar for one year. It did help a little as I didn't get any proper infection but the itchiness stayed. \nI only use cotton underwear, never used any products to wash my vagina, only water, always wiped front to back. I also was not overweight or didn't have any other issues. Except for acne. I started throwing away underwear more often.\n At the end of the period infections would come back or symptoms were increased. I used to use pads more then moved to tampons. \nWhen I was 19 I did not have any serious infections but every now and then would get itchy. I did not use any antifungals. And didn't  used antibiotics since the yeast infections started (as far as I can remember). \nI tested my blood sugar levels and everything was fine. \nThe next serious episode hit me after having sex with my boyfriend. We used latex condom. I bought clotrimazole external and  internal cream and after few days I felt better and the infection was not severe. Again the itchiness was till there.\nAfter having intercourse again and also some petting. My vulva was feeling itchy and burny and it stared hurting while I was peeing to the point I was in constant pain. So I went to GP got a swab but nothing was found (could be due to me using the cream) and I asked to do urine test and it turned out I had UTi. I got antibiotics and after taking them the peeing improved and I still used some cream so everything calmed down. This time I forgot to use probiotics. However the infection didn't come back and only itchiness stayed. \nEvery now and then I would get some discharge but I am so helpless I just ignore it. I changed from latex condoms to non latex ones. Although sex would hurt and it would burn a lot afterwards especially inside nearby the urethra area(like the top part of vagina). I haven't had sex for about 2 months and suddenly at the end of my period I got very burny infection. I can see the discharge and it looks like yeast infection. I did not have any sexual contact and haven't inserted anything into my vagina. The only thing is I used pads more this time and maybe ate more sugar than usual. I'm so sick of yeast infection ruining my life. Can anyone help me or have any ideas on what's going on?\n\nAlso I got tested for basic STIs and didn't find anything"

I'm about 5'1\" and 120-ish pounds (1.55m and 54.4kg), and I'm currently taking Zoloft (sertraline hydrochloride) and Wellbutrin SR (bupropion hydrochloride) for depression. I have a tendency to be dehydrated, so I made an extra effort to drink plenty of fluids on the day of the donation (my veins are also on the small side, so they're pretty tough to find when I'm dehydrated). \n\nDuring the actual donation, I was mostly fine. I was somewhat tense (they kept telling me to relax my shoulders) but not really squeamish (I'm thinking about going pre-med, so watching the blood collection was actually kind of cool). But as soon as it was over, I got a weird rushing sensation in my head. Then I vomited a couple times (I'd eaten about an hour before). I drank some Gatorade and ate a pack of pretzels, and I felt better pretty quickly. \n\nI kept sipping water throughout the day, but I also probably overexerted myself. After donating, I hurried to my dorm room to clean up and change, then all the way across campus so I could make it to class on time. I was fine then, but about three hours later when I was rushing around again, I suddenly felt light-headed and short of breath. I was hoping to push through it, but then everything around me started looking way too bright and it was so disorienting that I had to stop. I sat down and drank water for about half an hour (I also threw up a couple more times), and since then I've been mostly fine. When I got back to my room, I lay on my back and elevated my feet for an hour or so, and I also ate a lot of snacks. \n\nOne more thing: I'm not usually prone to nausea/vomiting, but I do believe that Zoloft makes me more predisposed to it (not sure if that's even a thing). The last time my dose got upped (several months ago), I felt a vague sense of nausea for a few days. During that time, I went on an amusement park ride with spinning seats, and that left me nauseous and gagging for a while (I've been on similar rides before, and never had this problem). I also get severe nausea ever time I take my meds on an empty stomach. That being said, it has never made me throw up before.\n\nSo, can anyone figure out what happened to me? Do you think it was a reaction to the blood loss or something to do with my medication? And do you think this will happen if I donate blood again?"

But I don't drink or smoke.\n\nHello!\n\nLet  me start by saying that I am very  aware that it is probably  controversial to ask a questions related to  drug use, and want to  stress that I am a responsible adult, I exercise, I  don't smoke or  drink, but I have found that the occasional (6-8 weeks  in between) lsd  or Psilocybin mushroom trip is incredibly therapeutic  for my emotional  and mental health. I have suffered with depression and  very bad food  addictions in the past, and I still struggle with taking  care of myself  when unpleasant feelings hit. But after a trip, I feel  connected to  who I am supposed to be, I meditate, I'm kinder and more  empathetic  with my friends and much much more resilient to work  stresses. I just  want to stress this because -- while it is totally fine  in my book to  do drugs recreationally -- the reason this is important  enough for me  to ask this here is because I feel like giving this  feeling up, without  trying to any route of research I can find, would  leave me with a  poorer quality of life.\n\nSo   here goes: Last October, I had Bell's Palsy. I took an lsd trip  (100ug) some 5 days before (i.e. long after the substance should have  left  my system). The palsy was preceded by a few days of feeling  draggy,  having a right-hemisphere headache and a very achy and stiff  neck. It  wasn't my first lsd trip and I never had those symptoms  before.\n\nI  didn't take anything  during my recovery, obviously, but I didn't have  the guts to tell my  doctors about the trip. My blood panel tested  positive for Lyme  disease, but in such a small amount that my  neurologist pretty much  ruled it out and diagnosed it as an idiopathic  palsy.\n\nI  also had big dental  issues on that side. I now know I had a massive  cyst in my right cheek  (the same side as the palsy), which couldn't be  diagnosed on x-ray. It  was infected several times and every time, my  dentist opened up the same  root canal, shrugged and prescribed  antibiotics. The cyst was recently  removed alongside three root tips.\n\nBy   February, most of my symptoms had receded (except for the fact that my   eye still closes a bit slower and not as tightly and I currently can't   close my eyes without the muscles in my cheek contracting, which is   incredibly annoying).  I wasn't feeling great about myself and I thought   I'd try a smaller dose (around 70 ug) and see what happens. Yes,   stupid. I know. What followed was a week of anxiety, because I again had   headaches and that pain in the back of my neck. But no palsy. It just   went away.\n\nAt that point I was   pretty much done with lsd because the positive effect was too   overshadowed by palsy panic. However, I tried shrooms for the first time   last week. I had hoped that I could have the same experience but   without the issues. (And yes, the experience was wonderful and mystical   and I feel so emotionally well right now...) But wrong. I've been   feeling draggy all week, really bad headaches, stiff neck and this time   I'm running a low grade fever (I can't tell if that was the case   previously; i never measured). I saw a doctor today, but I am new in   town, didn't know the doctor yet, he was super nice but looked old and   conservative and I didn't quite bring up the courage to ask about the   shrooms and the lsd. But he wasn't worried about my palsy history or   anything, but he ordered a blood panel for infection markers.\n\n**So now I have some questions:**\n\n* Could   it be that the psychedelics trigger something in the lyme disease so   that it gives me symptoms even though the tests show such a low antibody   count?\n* Could   they just lower the immune system and that somehow triggers a small   infection and the palsy was unrelated? But then why are the symptoms so   often mainly on the right side?\n* Other people [report headaches](https://www.reddit.com/r/DrugNerds/comments/1y65mr/lsd_and_headaches/)   after a trip - but usually not for as long. Some suggested it could be   due to the vasoconstrictive quality of the drug. Could that be  related?  These people suggest taking vasodilators before/during the  trip - is  there something to that?\n* Could it be related to the cyst? But it is removed now so it shouldn't, right?\n* I   have an appointment with a new neurologist tomorrow to talk about my   remaining palsy symptoms - how will he likely react if I ask him about   illegal drugs?\n* Could   it be harmless aches? This may sound stupid, but maybe it will show  how  deeply I appreciate what these substances do for my mental health,  when  I say that if I knew it was just aches and not signs of a serious   issue, I could see myself just taking that as the price to pay.\n\nThank you so, so much for any help. It is massively appreciated."

For the past 14 months I have had CBT to try and resolve any underlying issues, however, around 6-8 weeks ago my mental health became very difficult to manage.  I booked myself a doctors appointment and was willing to try medication for the first time to help me. The doctor prescribed me 15mg of Mirtazapine, not only to help with my depression and anxiety, but to help with my insomnia too.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe Mirtazapine helped enormously with my insomnia, and within 1-2 weeks it had really improved my depression and anxiety, which was very relieving! As time went on, the effects became a lot less noticable, and although it had improved my sleeping pattern, I began to feel more and more tired throughout the day, despite having 8-10+hour sleeps. In addition, (although I realised my weight/appetite would increase) I gained 15-20lbs in the 6-8 week period. Whilst taking the medication, my eating habits were very well in-control and I had increased the amount of exercise I was doing, and yet I was still gaining weight faster than I have ever done before.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBecause this is the first form of medication I have taken for mental health, I thought I would make a doctors appointment to see if there were any alternatives that wouldn't drastically increase my weight and wouldn't knock me out as much as Mirtazapine did.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe doctor prescribed me 50mg of Sertraline. I was told that if I wanted to, I could stop the Mirtazapine straight away  without having to taper down and I could start the Sertraline straight away too. And/or I could use the Mirtazapine in 7.5mg doses to help possible insomnia that may be brought on by the Sertraline. As well, the doctor said that if the side effects of the Sertraline are a little too much to begin with, I can reduce the dose to 25mg per day.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm a little concerned, because everything I've read says you should taper down to avoid any possible withdrawal symptoms. The doctor seemed very relaxed about when to start/stop taking medications, and also the doses in which I should be taking these medications.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUltimately, my questions are: Would it be ok for me to stop taking the Mirtazapine straight away and start with Sertraline? Are there any issues with taking Setraline and Mirtazapine together? If there's the potential for the Sertraline side effects to be too much at 50mg, would it be more sensible to start at 25mg and increase after a period of time?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you!"

        "reddit": "I've gone to the ER to check this out and results were fine (blood labs, EKG, x-ray). I'm a 5'10\" male, 150 lbs who has been sedentary for the past few years. Used to be active and eat healthy. Dealt with depression. \n\nOn several occasions now when I try to do something with heavy exertion my chest tightens and I get short of breath. Sometimes I even feel a little nausea. It lasts for days thereafter.\n\nThe ER doc said I look too healthy to be a heart disease candidate so I'm on the fence about seeing a cardiologist for further testing. \n\nMy dad and uncle both had triple bypass surgery last year. My grandfather has as well in the past. I, myself, used to be vegetarian and active and never had cholesterol or lipid issues. My current HR/BP is 70;110/70 even when I do experience symptoms.  I do tick the boxes for inactivity and psychological stress when it comes to heart disease.\n\nSo I guess my question is can I be experiencing this discomfort simply due to my heart being out of condition, and not necessarily atherosclerosis? I know when you're out of shape you can be short of breath walking up a flight of stairs, but the chest tightness for days is worrisome. You reckon if I start with light walking everyday and ramp up gradually I can get rid of this problem? Thank you."

Do not smoke/do any drugs and only drink on special occasions.\n\nLive in southern part of US.\n\nA few months ago, I remember drinking coffee and suddenly feeling very \"off\". I ate or drank nothing unusual (I tend to eat the same things everyday--eggs and coffee perhaps a toast with nut butter). I have no known allergies and never have. Then I began feeling pins and needles and feeling very overheated and broke out in a (more severe than the current) red rash. There were no raised parts or bumps. Just red blotches that were larger on my trunk, arms and legs and went around to my back, neck, face, etc. I have never experienced this so I had no benadryl or anything on me but my husband went to get that for me and it subsided eventually approx an hour later to a much less severe rash after taking. There was nothing unusual and I had similar amounts of caffeine to what I usually have, maybe 1/2 a cup more? but I'm a student and some days of higher caffeine intake are not unusual for me and I am mindful of having too much because I prioritize good sleep and lowering anxiety.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt hasn't happened since until today.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLeading up to reaction:\n\nI consumed  an energy drink that I will often consume before working out with \\~300 mg caffeine. I've had this numerous times with no issues: for those curious it was a Bang Energy Drink. I had no food prior (which is common for me as well) and also no other caffeine. I also try to sip this slowly so I am mindful. I probably drank it over a 30-45 minute time frame.  I took a B-complex vitamin as well as Vitamin D3. I forget to take this very often and I cannot remember if I took these the day it happened to me before, but I've taken it in the past with no issues. Additionally, I do supplement with a product called Ovasitol (myo-inositol) for PCOS symptoms.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nApproximately 30mins to an hour later after ingesting either of the aforementioned things, I felt completely fine then suddenly \"weird\" (this is the only explanation I can think of--just a very off feeling) and then the pins &amp; needles, \"hot\" feeling began.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*Both times the sensation originated around my neck/chest/shoulders.\\*\\*\n\nAfter the rash subsides, I am left with a sort of \"heavy\" feeling in my chest and it feels like it is mildly harder to breathe/pressure-y. I am unsure of this is a result of perhaps some anxiety due to the rash or if this is truly a physical symptom but thought i would mention it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCould I be allergic to caffeine? I find this unlikely because I consume it every single day. A B vitamin? From what I gather, it seems that either are extremely rare and unlikely.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTl;dr: Suddenly having allergic reaction to something. No changes in diet/lifestyle. Happens after ingesting things I have prior or often with zero issues. What could it be and is it worth exploring with a physician or do I just keep benadryl handy at all times?"

I've been experiencing it again since yesterday afternoon. Just a few minutes ago I was out getting the mail and when I walked back inside my vision was getting really blurry for a minute but this time it felt like everything was getting darker like I would black out. My chest got super tight, I got a lot of head pressure, and it felt really hard to breathe. I just took one of my hyrdoxyzines to try and calm down but I'm so scared that I am actually about to die.\n\nI went to the doctor last week where he checked on everything and said I was fine. He gave me Prozac which I have been on for 6 days. I wonder if my dose is too high because I have experienced dizziness and a very scary \"blacking out\" sort of feeling when blinking or closing my eyes. I think I may also be having suicidal thoughts, but I really don't want to die I just want my old life back. I have another appointment with the same doctor in 3 weeks but I don't know how much longer I can deal with this. Maybe the meds were a mistake this whole time. \n\nEverything around me feels fake and like I'm drifting away from it. I know everybody says I can't die but each time I think it feels more like I will. Everyone except me and my sister are going out of town tonight and a lot of the next 3 days I'll be home by myself. I'm worried I'm just going to black out and have no one to help me. \n\nI feel like everything is ruined beyond repair. The feeling still hasn't gone away.

Thank you in advance for your help.\n\nI\u2019m going to be as concise as possible:\n\nI was diagnosed with bronchitis by my primary doctor and allergist/immunologist the end of last March. The breathing issues I experienced were unlike anything I\u2019d ever had ; couldn\u2019t get a deep breath, shortness of breath, coughing (productive at first).\n\nI was subsequently given several rounds of antibiotics and a few prednisone bursts, which had minimal effect. I also had 3 chest x-rays (over the course of months) and a chest ct scan. (I also ended up in the ER twice.)\n\nAfter about 2 months, I was referred to a pulmonologist and cardiologist. An echocardiogram and stress test were performed with normal results. \n\nThe pulmonologists (I sought two opinions) performed pft. Both were average, no diseases indicated. The second, performed about two weeks ago exceeded average. My lungs are always clear upon examination. I don\u2019t wheeze. I had been taking Pulmicort 2x a day, and seemed slightly more symptomatic when it was reduced. I recently switched to Asthmanex to see if it has a better impact. Albuterol has minimal impact on symptoms. \n\nMy peak flows are always 500 and I oxygenate perfectly at rest and on exertion. \n\nPulmonologist 1 said on paper I don\u2019t have asthma, but believes I now need a long acting inhaler in addition as the Pulmicort didn\u2019t help much. \n\nPulmonologist 2 said, if anything, I have \u201cirritable airways\u201d and perhaps \u201cjuvenile\u201d asthma. He now is sending me for a barium esophagram to rule out issues with my esophagus. \n\nI also saw a rheumatologist and had extensive testing. No indication of any immune diseases. \n\nI saw an ENT, was scoped. I have LPR and nodules on my vocal chords. I also had some Candida in the back of my throat, which I treated, and swelling of my vocal chords, and laryngitis. She suggested Zantac 2x/day for two weeks.\n\nThe one positive is my cough has reduced greatly and almost disappeared.\n\nNow, my main symptoms are;\n\n1. Feeling that I cannot get a deep enough breath (on and off)\n2. Chest congestion/ some pressure (on/off)\n3. Shortness of breath on exertion. \n4. Intermittent horseness\n\n\nIt feels like I still have bronchitis to a lesser degree. Doctors have said I do not have chronic bronchitis, however. \n\nI also yawn and have air hunger. It lasts all day. I am worried I will have to quit my job, as it\u2019s difficult for me to function like this.\n\nI\u2019m confused, have gone to literally countless doctors appointments.\n\nEdited to add: I have been told I \u201cmay\u201d have Mast Cell Activation Syndrome based on a persistently elevates tryptase level (14-16). This has remained stable for 3 years and is checked every 6 months."

Can they run the test with that? The people in the lab department that talked to me said the sample was still valid, that they didn't need a new extraction.

I was trying to check if food could be the cause of that rash through some allergy, since I was told it could be \"sweat\", or the type of T-shirt I wore. Bathing daily, not doing any sports, cotton t-shirts did absolutely nothing for it. When I reintroduced processed foods, primarily wheat products, it came back.\n\nIf I avoid exposure for a couple weeks and reintroduce them in the next few days I get a pretty noticeable rash that settles down (probably high cortisol related) to this state after weeks of consuming an unrestricted diet. I also get irritability and feel \"accelerated\" but fatigued shortly after eating wheat (1-3 hours) and 12-48 hours later I get a sensation of \"burning\" and pain all around my abdomen (lower, upper, mid, sides.. it changes).\n\nTo add: I had **asthma** and allergies since childhood (not so apparent anymore), with very high IgE levels, but only tested for **air allergens (positive test)** and some dentist anesthesias (tested mildly positive for one, the dentist also observed a minor reaction as a child).\n\n10 years ago tested multiple things for high blood pressure, heart was ok, renal ok, organs were ok, thyroid ok, blood markers were all ok except for **Cortisol**, which was high. Tested for cushing and was negative. Derived to cardiologist and psychiatrist, didn't follow on that since I didn't consider that to solve the problem, it was just to treat the symptom and by that time I had been through 2 years of bureaucracy.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was thinking of an allergy when I first went to the doc, considering my background, but they said testing for celiac was more important. By now I've been eating a gluten containing diet for months, it does make me feel pretty bad, but considering I have no anemia or any celiac in the family I wasn't so sure about it and still think I should go to an immunologist next."

        "reddit": "Hi all,\n\nRandom stuff: 28M, 5 feet 10 inches, 200 pounds, white, USA.\n\nI've had CNS issues my entire life (had to learn how to balance in school and was supporting my weight with handrails up until grade 2-3). According to my father he was told by a psychologist (or some type of doctor) that I'd never be able to ride bikes or play basketball or anything like \"normal kids do\".\n\nAnyway, I managed to get around the balance issues. I still have fine tremors in my legs but can run and walk just fine. Balance is still an issue when walking in a straight line, but not enough of one to bother me.\n\nI've also been plagued with learning disabilities my entire life, along with a mental haze.\n\nFastforward to six years ago. Falling over on hikes because my right leg gave out on me. No issues with leg structure, muscles or anything else. So it's likely a CNS issue. Specifically, my knee gave out on me. Doctor couldn't find anything wrong.\n\n**Fastforward** to three years ago. Suicidal thoughts, depression, flat emotions. Diagnosed with BPD and bipolar and major depression. Have seen several psychiatrists since and none of them agree with the BPD or bipolar diagnosis. Nobody knows what happened to cause the issue.\n\nFastforward to two years ago. Fell down the stairs and broke the handrail. Still not sure what happened there, it's pretty fuzzy.\n\nAgain, fastforward to last year. Complete paralysis of my body, couldn't even move my eyes. Started with random arm movements and around 3-4 minutes later couldn't move anything. CT clean, so I'm on my way again.\n\nIn that time period, I have had: Repeated episodes of dissociation / seizure like activity / blanking out / cutting myself with a kitchen knife because I spaced out. I have had tremors, officially diagnosed with essential tremors but likely not parkinsons.\n\nI have also been officially diagnosed with sleep apnea in that time period. Not due to AHI but because I had 300+ rera's in the night along with 200+ awakenings in my sleep study.\n\nDuring these paralysis events (brief or long) I am fully aware of my surroundings. I just can't move anything. I've had a paralyzed diaphragm for several minutes. Most of the time the diaphragm isn't paralyzed but I'm not consciously aware of breathing, either.\n\nMy longest event was around three hours according to the hospital.\n\nFastforward to the last couple of months: MRI to rule out more neurological issues. Non-specific lesion was detected in my face. Radiologist didn't know what it was, the doctor who took the biopsy said it was likely vascular as it's a soft lesion. 4+ biopsy needles and when the results came back it was \"non-specific\" and likely not indicative of the lesion...\n\nI've also developed rear molar pressure that the dentist said isn't due to my teeth. It's on the same side of my face as the lesion. This comes and goes and doesn't bother me too much.\n\nI've developed facial nerve issues. Feels like it's cold all the time (icy) with weird sensations. Very hard to describe. When the doctor took the lesion biopsy I didn't feel much of anything. The doctor kept saying she was sorry for the pain this was going to cause me - nothing. The only thing I felt was when the lesion was moving around during the biopsy as that sent shock-like sensations through my CNS, but not pain. Caused me to jerk reflexively several times.\n\nPreface: I have been having hard pea-sized lumps in both earlobes that come and go. PCP couldn't biopsy them because it's my ears and the dermatologist decided it wasn't worth seeing me over.\n\nFirst EEG came back normal. Second EEG (sleep deprived) I haven't had the results yet, but the tech did comment that I'm stuck in stage 1-2 sleep and don't have any REM. This is also the exact results of my sleep study, so no surprise.\n\nI'm going to insist that the doctor take another biopsy or just remove the lesion. She blew me off last time saying it was likely nothing to worry about as it's a soft lesion and wasn't very interesting. I had to insist. But I'm just looking for some advice on how to proceed from here and what kind of treatment/testing I should be looking at."

Additional history includes gastroparesis, GI absorption issues, triple positive ILC breast cancer (bilateral mastectomy 2018, reconstruction 2019) and migraine-induced seizures either caused by or causing brain lesions (MS ruled out). I take anastrozole for breast cancer, venlafaxine for seizure prevention (increased to combat anastrozole side effects), and zolpidem for the anastrozole side effect of insomnia. In the next few months (after last Herceptin infusion 9/26) I will have a Dilaudid pump inserted into my waist, my third breast surgery, and then a full hysterectomy.*\n\nI've asked parts of this before, but things continue to get worse, to the point that I'm thinking about seeking therapy for the first time in my life over it. I have at least three major medical problems (in the process of confirming a fourth), but recent horrible experiences are causing me to develop such a fear of being mistreated again that I've been refusing to go to the ER, even if it means putting myself in danger. I am supposed to have three surgeries in the next four months, and I'm dreading it when I've plowed through worse in the past 50 years without even a speed bump.\n\nPlease keep in mind that most of this happened while I was an obvious chemo patient - bald/fuzzy, body fluids flying everywhere, etc. - and that the cause of seeking treatment was usually the most common chemo side effects doubling up on a lifetime, 50 years of hospital records, of a GI problem that caused the same physical issues. My oncologist actually spoke with me about discontinuing chemo and taking my chances because I was so dangerously ill a few times. Also very important, my GI team, the practice right there at the hospital, agreed wholeheartedly with a lifelong diagnosis of absorption disorder and GIs have told me and everyone for years that if something is available IV/port, administer it via IV/port, since it's pretty impossible to tell how much I'm effectively being dosed otherwise aside from there being a marked difference in recovery time. It was also pretty globally known that my husband also had cancer. We were in adjacent rooms in the hospital for a week at one point, and constantly there with the other the rest of the times.\n\nExcept for one exception, ERs treat me very well, very appropriately, and only admit me for serious reasons: intestinal obstruction on film, dehydration causing critically low potassium, infection at recent surgical site, can't remember the name of the infection where they dressed up in hazmat stuff for four days, etc. Then I had four horrific experiences in a row as an inpatient, and it really damaged me. #1 and #4 happened at my regular hospital, an excellent nationally known/lauded network, where I've been an inpatient more times than I can count.\n\n1. I was admitted for a triple whammy - bronchitis, surgical site infection, and intestinal ileus. The hospitalist team refused to administer medications intravenously. After eight days of pain and suffering, I finally convinced them that this was the problem, they switched to IV, and I was better and released four days later, the usual timeframe. 3x longer in the hospital, than the other half dozen stays in the past six months, because they wouldn't listen to me, my GI, or my surgeon (who called me from vacation irate when I left a VM that a surgical fellow planned on opening me back up while I had an infection).\n2. I was admitted for an intestinal blockage that cleared itself, so the GI team took advantage of my presence by doing an alternate colonoscopy prep (because they have always said the usual prep could kill me) and doing a colonoscopy. During the five day stay, the hospitalist didn't examine me once. The very first day, while I still had a blockage on film, he started harassing me about opioid use. My regular doctors are angry because this had been part of my treatment plan for 12 years and I was prescribed/taking very moderate doses, and only about five days a month. I could relay back and forth conversation that would (and does) infuriate most physicians - five days of daily harassment where I never lost my cool, just kept telling him to please read my records, call my specialists, count my pills which only decreased in number by about 5 in the two months since I'd been there... flat out harassed me.\n3. I was sent to a new GI, very highly regarded, fresh eyes, yadda yadda. He was wonderful during office visits - squeezed my shoulder and said, \"We WILL help you.\" Not. Again, soooo much suffering, but too much detail. A friend witnessed the ER admitting me 4am-ish because there was a blockage on my x-ray. The GI flew into the room that morning, angry, \"The first thing we're doing is cutting the Dilaudid dose in half.\" by day four, I was exhausted with pain and starting to really get upset about this new pattern of being chastised by doctors daily for the first time in 50 years. He did an endoscopy and I woke up to him already yelling at me that there is nothing wrong with me, that I've been faking for the drugs (for 45 years, apparently...devised this plan when I was 5), that he had already heard from #2 above, threatened to code it in a way that Medicare wouldn't cover it... nightmare. The next day, my usual perfect 110/80 was 170/105 in pain when they told me they were releasing me around 11am. I told them I could ask my father to pick me up on his way home from work around 4pm. Not good enough, leave now. WTH? I started taking pictures of the BP and some other things. SIX people came back into the room to all bully me together. I contacted my (business) attorney, told them I was doing so, and repeated his replies to them. After they ignored laws he cited, the last advice my attorney gave was to tell them I was exercising my Medicare right to an appeal. The hospitalist (who I couldn't even identify at the time because I never saw him) nastily said, \"Go ahead. As of this moment, I am cutting off all medication. You will just lie here for two days.\" I didn't help my cause any by eventually asking, \"Where, exactly, is the \"do no harm\" happening here?\" Flabberghasted attorney, hypertensive level 7-8 pain for me... nightmare. The kicker? My PCP called in three prescriptions a week later for the infection the GI found when he did the endoscopy. (Also had a falling out over it with my beloved PCP of 13 years, but that's too much extra detail.) (Also FWIW, this all happened when doctors knew my husband was in another hospital having a major lung and lymph node surgery. I was being yelled at while waiting to hear that my husband had come through OK, being kicked out with no one at home.)\n4. I was very sick from recent infusion, fell and hit my head, later to learn I had a concussion. I was found in a nearby park four hours later, extremely dehydrated, horrible vertigo and light sensitivity, vomiting, and having no idea how I had gotten there or when. Strangers who happened to be nurses called an ambulance. When they started IV, I asked if they could please test for opiates (they couldn't) and explained. One EMT had a physician father and said doctors were going crazy like this everywhere. She was angry about it like all good medical personnel are. Among other things, I had an intestinal ileus when admitted, because my bowels become HYPERactive when I don't graze on food and then they seize, no bowel sounds past the lower right. The overnight doctor actually looked at my records, understood the anomaly, and had a friendly, curious midnight chat about it with me after giving me 1mg Dilaudid that brought the pain down to a bearable 4 and let my intestines relax from the \"seizing\". Shift change. No one would medicate me. I spent eight straight hours crying, sometimes delirious, in level 8-9 stomach pain and about a level 5 headache - one day after a concussion, remember -  fingertip shaped bruises from gripping my own arm so tight during spikes. My nurse was begging doctors to reconsider. She even looked into me going AMA and coming back in through the ER, but Medicare would have refused to cover it. We finally \"handled things\" ourselves (family, nurse not involved or knowing). The next day, the hospitalist was appalled that my own GI doctors didn't show up for 23 hours after being called and pain management never responded to the call. I shared with him that the day before had been the second-worst day of my life - the first being the day I was brutally raped in college. My nurse-the-whole-time sniffled when she apologized for the hundredth time and hugged me goodbye. She felt terrible. It had taken its toll on her, too.\n\nThat's it. I'm now filled with anxiety about unfamiliar hospitalists (while I'm trying to get a false diagnosis of general anxiety off my medical records, but that's a whole other story) and I am going to be in the hospital at least three times yet this year for full-on, GA, under the knife surgeries, one with an OBGYN and a general surgeon because they are concerned about what's going to happen when they cut into all of the adhesions for the hysto. My regular doctors are all appalled, angry - my PCP fractured his wrist and was accused of embellishing for pain medication - but all say office physicians don't insert unsolicited advice when hospitalists are running point. My MD/JD aunt thinks it would be as close to a slam dunk med mal as you can get, but advised us not to sue for several reasons, not the least of which that it would be a long, arduous process while MY HUSBAND AND I BOTH HAVE F'ING CANCER.\n\nHow do I fix this? Who do I write to? Who do I report to? WHAT DO I DO? This has become like twilight zone insane, how much power doctors wield and how effortlessly they can pretty much ruin someone's life, or at least their psyche."

Because I didn\u2019t want to go to school my parents put me through a online/health school program. To be eligible to work with the health school I had to be seeing a therapist regularly. I saw one once a week, and at the end of the year he called a meeting with my mum and me. He talked a bit about me and then dropped the bomb that he thinks I have Aspergers and that I should get it checked out.\n\nThe reason I believe him is I\u2019ve always had a secret suspicion that I have aspergers, partly because a friend of mine growing up had it and when she pointed out some traits that she has are because if the aspergers, I noticed I have similar traits, such as obsessing over certain topics or understanding social cues.\n\nA couple of months ago we moved house and I decided to go to a local school (and feel much happier now than before). My mum and I went to see a doctor to get out medical documents transferred, and get our height weight blood pressure ect checked. I came back all good but when I brought up the possibilities of being checked for aspergers (I left the health school before they could arrange for me to be tested) he was all weird about it, saying he didn\u2019t want me to be tested incase it got put on my record or something.\n\nI said that I don\u2019t mind, I just want to know, but he was still weird about it and so was my mum. Later on I asked my mum if I could get tested and she said maybe but wouldn\u2019t talk more. Everyone I\u2019ve tried to talk about it to seems to think I should forget about it, except for my best friends who has some problems around getting diagnosed herself. \n\nAt this point I don\u2019t really care if I have it or not, I just want to know the truth. Mostly because I think knowing would make my life easier, also I\u2019m not sure if it can be inherited genetically, but if it can and one of my kids get it I want them to know earlier on than I did so they don\u2019t have to go through what I do.\n\nWhat I\u2019m asking is if theres a way I can get tested (for free preferably, I don\u2019t have a job) for aspergers without my parents consent, because I\u2019ve asked many many times to be tested but they either make excuses or forget. I don\u2019t know if its different for each country but I live in New Zealand if that helps. Any help or advice would be appreciated, thank you."

Previously smoked socially, maybe 5 total cigarettes on the weekends? Minimal drinking, especially after this health issue. I haven't had any alcohol in 10 days as well, but I previously drank about 3 glasses of wine on Friday nights. Never more than that. Not the best diet but it isn't all junk food. I need more fruits and veggies but I think it's a fairly average American diet. Not a lot of fast food though. I do a lot of walking (I go to college at a gigantic university) but no cardio. I drink at least 80 oz of water a day, usually more like 100. No caffeine consumption other than the Excedrin I've recently started taking to help with my headaches. I don't avoid caffeine per se, but I don't seek it out. Sometimes I'll grab a coffee before class but it isn't a habit. No recreational drugs.\n\nList of symptoms with 0 context:\n\n**-Extreme lightheadedness and dizziness after standing, no matter how long I've been sitting for. I have not fainted but I have nearly fallen (I held on to my friend to keep from falling).**\n\n**-Sporadic numbness and tingling (pins and needles) all over my body, usually in my arms and legs but has also spread over my trunk a few times, and has affected my face and mouth/tongue (I sounded drunk).**\n\n**-Many short-lived migraine attacks about 3 times a day, lasts for about 30 mins and they make my vision in both eyes become blurry, sort of like a drop of water on a lens. Massive pain in sinus area.**\n\n**-Neck pain ALL. THE. TIME. It's hard to sleep because no matter how I position myself it feels like my neck is strained.**\n\nNow I'll type it out in a more narrative format.\n\nAbout four weeks ago, I noticed the light headedness upon standing. I've gone through phases of this in the past, so I figured I would just be better about eating more snacks more often and add more salt to my food. After a week of doing what has helped in the past with no improvement, I started to get worried. Then, along with the light headedness, I began to get throbbing pain in my temples and sinuses and I also developed visual disturbances after I would stand up.\n\nSo light headedness after standing ----&gt; light headedness + throbbing head pain after standing ----&gt; light headedness + throbbing head pain + visual disturbances. This developed over about 2 weeks.\n\nThis sucked, but I wasn't too worried. Then, one night, I got out of my car after a 15 minute drive and I had the worst dizziness of my life (this was when I had to hold on to my friend to keep from falling). The visual thing happened, the head pain happened, but something new happened this time. I got pins and needles in the left side of my face and my left shoulder and arm. This \"episode\" lasted about 45 minutes. I was conscious, I was aware and able to have a conversation, but the sensations were FREAKING me out.\n\nThe next night, I had another tingly episode after standing up. It legitimately felt like a stroke. I was terrified. I was confused this time, I couldn't connect my brain to my body (like I couldn't recognize my numb arm as MY arm, if that makes any sense) and the tingling went up to my throat and mouth. I had the visual disturbances again, and the head pain. \n\nNow I have at least 1 full-on episode everyday. By full-on episode I mean after I stand up, I have the throbbing head pain, the visual disturbances, the dizziness, and the pins-and-needles sensation. I have several more \"mini\" episodes that don't involve all of those aspects, just some combination of them.\n\nThese episodes always occur after I stand up, but not every time I stand up. Sometimes I get lucky and I can stand up just fine.\n\nI went to the ER 2 Sundays ago and they did a CBC, chest x-ray, and an EKG. They reported back as normal. I followed up with my primary care doc last Thursday and he is pretty sure it's some sort of neurological migraine, which I don't disagree with, but he seemed to write off the triggering event, which is standing up. He said that he thinks that is a separate issue even though I explained to him that I only get the migraine attacks AFTER standing up. \n\nI have an MRI scheduled for this Sunday.\n\nIs this really just an intense migraine? Does the fact that standing up triggers a migraine mean anything?"

He referred me to a colleague of his. My tentative diagnosis is Meniere's disease. I have also had extreme migraines over the same period of time that these symptoms appeared, and I recently had a blindspot appear for a short period of time in my left eye so I am being referred to an ophthalmologist.\n\nBasically, I am a walking disaster.\n\nDue to the blindspot, my ENT mentioned concerns of intracranial hypertension in conjunction with Meniere's. I had a temporal bone CT scan that was clean other than showing a very thickened eardrum and some stenosis due to multiple surgeries on my ear as a child (from chronic otitis media). I had a hearing test that shows both high and low pitch hearing loss in both ears. Next Tuesday, I am having a brain MRI with contrast and a sinus CT. On September 12, I am having vestibular testing conducted.\n\nThey were very gung-ho about Meniere's disease and seem to think that's exactly what this is. They want to inject my thickened eardrum with a steroid 3-5 times and think that will resolve my symptoms. They put me on Diamox for 6 days and it didn't do anything other than give me some wonderful cystic acne spots. I've read that the steroid injections can make my already terrible hearing worse. I am literally throwing-up every day, I have had to start working 32 hours per week instead of 40, and I'm losing tons of weight. I'm desperate for a cure, so if I need to do the injections, I will.\n\nMy question for you, Reddit experts, is: Does this sound like Meniere's? Should I just go for the injections?"

Trigeminal Neuralgia attacks occur on the right side of her face, mainly on her cheek and lips, but the pain has been migrating towards her brows and forehead in recent months.\n\n**QUESTION**\n\nEverything I have read about MVD surgery for Trigeminal Neuralgia states that surgical options should only be pursued for those who \"still experience debilitating pain despite best medical management.\"\n\nCan someone explain what \"best medical management\" and \"debilitating pain\" means? My mother has TN and has been taking rising amounts carbmazepine for over two decades and she has struggled with it the entire time. It hasn't always been \"debilitating\" but it hasn't necessarily been a walk in the park. If MVD has a success rate of over 80% (Mayo Clinic states over 90%), then why wouldn't this be a better option? Why treat the symptoms when you can treat the disorder? Is it simply because surgical procedures are inherently risky so the risk/benefit analysis simply leans towards not having surgery?\n\nIs it truly better for my mother when she has an attack to decide between taking medications to achieve slightly less pain but being completely zonked out and miserable or forging medication and grit her teeth in immense pain in order to have the coherence and presence to conduct as best of a normal life as possible? That is better than surgery that has a 80-90+% rate of success?\n\nThe doctor discourages surgery because he says the 80-90% success numbers aren't reliable and do not count those who have reoccurrence of pain but that's not what my limited research shows. I simply can't understand why he would be so adamant against it. We're highly considering getting a second opinion not to seek out a doctor who will simply rubber stamp an approval of the surgery, but better explain why the choice of pain &amp; misery vs. less pain and non-coherence is a better option than surgical risks for a highly successful procedure.\n\nThanks for all the advice."

I have been suffering from so many symptoms for so many years, it's driving me insane. I've been to a neurologist, ENT specialist, endocrinologist, I have had all sorts of blood work done, an MRI of my brain, EEG, EKG, - everything has been negative. I should mention that I am in general a very anxious person, but I am not a hypochondriac. My symptoms took a turn for the worse after leaving an alcoholic boyfriend of 3.5 years, which was the most stressful period of my life. \n\nHere's a list of symptoms that I have been experiencing:\n\n\\- strong Deja V\u00fa feeling accompanied by a weird stomach sensation and feeling like blacking out - if I sit down, it goes away (first time I did not sit down and next thing I remember is waking up on the floor)\n\n\\- regular Deja V\u00fa's as well, sometimes a few times a day or a few in a row (for example looking at my phone triggers them)\n\n\\- mild burning sensation in my right leg and sometimes my left hand that usually goes away at night (have had that for the past month)\n\n\\- a falling sensation in my head (as if in an elevator), which last for a brief second\n\n\\- random anxiety attacks that come on suddenly or just a feeling of inner stress that may last for a few days\n\n\\- just feeling weird in general, which is very hard to describe\n\n\\- ringing in ears (a few times a week)\n\n\\- nausea that's not related to what I eat\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have had a brain tumor ruled out, epilepsy, MS, thyroid issues, other autoimunne disorders....my neurologist pretty much thinks it's anxiety related. I made the mistake of telling her about my stressful relationship, and how it made everything worse, although I'd had many of the symptoms prior to that. Still, that's why she thinks it's anxiety. I do not disagree, but can one's mind really do this? I feel like I am going crazy. Life isn't fun like this. I always wait for the Deja V\u00fa to happen or the weird feeling in my head to ruin the rest of my day. Nobody understands. I know my stress levels have been trough the roof, but these attacks usually happen when I am feeling good or not thinking about anything negative. \n\nI don't know what to do anymore. I feel like an idiot. If it's something besides anxiety, what could it be? Should I ask for more tests or should I just go to a psychologist?"

And to explain myself, I felt like the pancreatic eznymes weren't really helping either.\n\nDoctors have always noted how fast my heart rate was and how low my blood pressure always was.  A regular appointment from my PCP brought up the dysautonomia suspicion again. She referred me to a specialist. The specialist did a tilt table test, which I passed. However, she diagnosed me with dysautonomia based on my history and symptoms. I am on beta blockers and it has really helped my heart rate. I've been drinking the correct amount of water and eating more salt. I still need to get compression socks. (although, I think she says that compression stalkings, or even full leg compression is better, but in Alabama I am already way too hot and my heat tolerance is awful)\n\nIt's just this one persistent symptom I can't relieve. I can't go out and enjoy myself for long before having to leave because I am shaking so bad and feel awful. My blood sugar has always been normal. My thyroid levels have always been normal. It happens mostly while active, but at times will happen when I am not. I can start to feel it in my stomach, it feels sort of cold and then my limbs will start shaking. I can sort of also predict when it's coming on. I just don't really know what to do at this point.\n\nedit:// this post was brought on by my episode today at the Botanical Gardens.  these happens once a day, or once every few days. especially at work, where I cashier.\n\nDocs, what do you suggest?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you."

One thing I should note is I am awful at taking my medicine and I will often go weeks or months without taking it once I run out because I forget to refill it. I just recently started taking it again after many months of being off it. I\u2019m starting at 50 mg a day and going to up it slowly to 150 mg because my doctor said this reduces side effects. \n\nA couple days ago I was just hanging out at home and I felt fine and normal, and then all of a sudden, I started feeling hot and sweaty, my heart started beating fast, and I felt nauseous. The edges of my vision were going black and I felt really dizzy, weak, and confused. I recognized that if I didn\u2019t sit down right then, that I was going to pass out and fall on the ground, so I quickly sat down and laid my head down on a table. The feeling was so intense and I\u2019m not sure how long it lasted, but I feel like I could have passed out for a few seconds or lost consciousness, but I\u2019m not sure if I did or if I would be able to tell if I did. I just kept thinking in my head \u201cit\u2019s going to be ok, it\u2019ll be over soon\u201d trying to calm myself down because I felt like I was dying. I felt like I was going to throw up but didn\u2019t. Anyways, after maybe about 5 minutes everything just kind of stopped and I was able to stand up and get back to what I was doing, with no lingering effects. \n\nI\u2019ve experienced this about four times in my life that I can remember, first when I was around age 14, then around age 16, then a couple months ago, and the most recent one. Each time it was triggered by seemingly nothing and it was the same experience of symptoms.\n\nHere are some things I suspect could be causing it:\n\n-It could be a side effect of restarting the medication. The most recent attack coincided with me starting the pills again, but I don\u2019t remember if it lines up for the rest of the times. I also don\u2019t remember if I had even started them the first time by the time I had my first \u201cattack\u201d at age 14. \n\n-It could be related to my periods. They have always been intense and I believe for at least two of the attacks I had I noticed my period started the very next day. Could also be a coincidence and this also did not occur with the most recent attack.\n\n-Could be panic attacks or something of the sort. I don\u2019t know much about them but it sounds kind of similar and I do have anxiety. However I read that they have lasting effects for the rest of the day and I don\u2019t experience this.\n\n-Could also be related to my eating habits. I\u2019m not anorexic or anything but I believe my height and weight put me in the underweight category. I go through phases occasionally where I have a bad loss of appetite and I don\u2019t eat a lot, like maybe one meal a day (I know this is bad). I\u2019m in one of these now which lines up with the most recent attack but I don\u2019t remember about the others. \n\nAlso, I got tested for anemia a few years ago but the doctor told me I was healthy.\n\nI don\u2019t have health anxiety in general and I\u2019m never really worried about myself or my health, but this last incident has me worried because I don\u2019t want it to happen in public when I\u2019m alone or can\u2019t get anywhere to sit fast enough. The second time it happened to me I was walking alone through a parking lot and I had to literally lay down for a sec in the middle of it; clearly that\u2019s not very safe. I also would just go to the doctor but I have a fear of getting blood drawn and I\u2019m pretty sure that\u2019s the first thing they\u2019re going to ask. I\u2019m also going to college in a few days which is several hours away from my doctor. I\u2019m just wondering how serious this issue is and whether anyone knows what it is. Does it sound like it\u2019s something specific being caused by something, or is this more of just a thing that happens to people sometimes for multiple reasons? Thank you! I will answer any questions you have."

Most of my memory of the first 4 days is almost non existent as I was continually medicated, for what, I am uncertain. I was in and out of conciousness (mostly out of), for those first 4 days. I was transferred to a different hospital on the 4th day. \n\n   I noticed a tightness in my chest and breathing, as well as pain in upper part of the inside of my throat that sits next to my ear canal on the right hand side (sometimes hurts to swallow, also causes ear pain like an infection might, that comes and goes) after being moved as I was now mostly lucid and able to hold a conversation. \n\n\n  They released me 3 days later, said I was fine and I went home. I was back in and out of the hospital 2 more times after this for the breathing. The first one I walked into ED, and I was admitted. I was given breathing treatments and antibiotics. I had to leave early against medical advice due to roommates moving out in a rush. I went back in 24 hours later by ambulance, and they stopped the antibiotics, said it wouldn't help, and started giving me prednisone. When I was released, they sent me home with prednisone, and I finished it as prescribed. It did seem to help when I was taking it. I did have a specialst look at my throat when I was in the hospital on the 3rd visit, he found a bit of swelling but no actual damage. They suspected I might have fluid built up. \n\n   It is here I need to inform you all I have type 1 diabetes and stage 4 renal failure, and am suffering from edema. During the 1st trip after being moved I was placed on a liquids only diet for the duration of that stay as I could not swallow solid food without severe pain that would cause me to cry. I would not be able to start swallowing solid food (uncomfortably) until 2 weeks later. My voice did not return (mostly) to normal until 2 months later.\n\n  I still cannot raise my voice above \"indoor\" without audible distress to my breathing and voice (I still sound \"raspy\"). I cannot inhale too quickly (like ome would while singing), and any excess physical activity outside of walking normally, (i.e. carrying heavy items or walking too fast) renders me gasping for breath. First thing in the morning, I cannot breath well and am gasping and clearing my throat until I have been in a upright position for 10 minutes. At night as I fall asleep and I relax, I can hear the snore like noises I make (this is abnormal for me). Some days this gets a little better, and other days (like today) I am miserable and fearing an ER visit. Vaping doesn't always make it worse, sometimes it feels like it helps. I do have a mild allergy to my kitty cat, so I feel that might explain the symptoms while I sleep or am in my room for long periods of time. \n\n  I did see my new primary care physician (first visit), he sent in trainees and didn't even see me himself, they couldn't see anything on an initial exam, and so issued me a referral.\n\n\n   I do not have an appointment with a specialist until 9/18, and this has been affecting my quality of life for almost 3 months. I can't exercise, I can't do most of my chores or other activities by myself or I start having what feels like a serious asthma attack and I get dizzy and can't breathe. Can ANYONE tell me what is going on and what I can do to ease my symptoms? I cannot afford financially to take time off of work to go back to the hospitals that failed me in the first place.\n \n\nThank you for reading my wall of text.

The panic, however, was before I received treatment. I am currently on 25mg Vistaril as needed for panic. No other medications. I suffer from IBS-C, chronic constipation, and just recently, doctors believe I suffer from GERD. I have not had an endoscopy yet. I am taking nothing but Tums for the acid, which kinda helps and kinda doesn't.\n\nA few weeks ago, I began experiencing a sudden onset, sharp, stabbing pain in the left side of my chest. This caused me to panic, obviously. I woke up the next day and that entire side of my chest was a moderate achy pain. I took Tylenol and it seemed to calm down, but my nerves have been a mess ever since. I suffer from mild vertigo from time to time, and I get worn out when I panic so I can't even say this is causing fatigue for sure. I checked my blood pressure twice that day and it was perfectly fine. The pain has jumped into my left shoulder and armpit, mildly, and sometimes into my left forearm, which can be very, very sharp, right above my elbow on the top side. I went to the doctor two days ago and explained my symptoms. I had my vitals checked, all were normal. The doctor decided to run an EKG and a chest X-Ray. The EKG came back fine, chest X-Ray I will find out tomorrow. I feel a constant slight pressure in my chest, and if I move a certain direction, it can become a quick stabbing pain. There is no visible swelling/bruising. I'm not sure what to do if the doctor calls me tomorrow and tells me the X-ray is fine, because I'm dealing with some pretty moderate pain and discomfort. It doesn't feel like pain from reflux/GERD and the pain itself is not anxiety, I know the difference. Any things I can recommend to my doctor? I was baffled that she didn't order a blood test, but I'm gonna need more testing. I appreciate any advice I receive!"

I have been vaping for about a year with 2-3mg of nicotine. About 7+ weeks ago, I had a week long migraine. I have a history of migraines but they are down to 2ish/year from being chronic since I was 6. This migraine consisted of the usual nausea, vomiting, and sensitivity to light. So the week goes by, and the migraine is gone, but the nausea didn't go away. I threw up about once or twice a day. Freaking out thinking I'm pregnant, but I wasn't. After week 2, I started extreme constipation. This is gunna be a long one. \n\nI would pass my bowels about 1once every 3-5 days and the were painful and even caused bleeding. If I touched or gently pushed between my ribs or touched my left side and lower abdomen, it would hurt. So me being super stubborn, week 4, I finally go to an urgent care. He gave me a strong nausea med (Ondanestron 4mg. Strong to me) but that was I next day, I go to the ER. \n\nThe ER doc presses on my left side (mind you I'm already crying in pain because I can't poo) and I scream. They do a CT scan and find nothing in my abdomen but liver irregularities. They said this could just be from years of anti inflammatory and Birth control meds. Sent me home with a resolvable Ondanestron 4mg, Pantoprazole 40mg, Dicyclomine 20mg. Come 4th of July, I landed back in the ER and their CT scan (different ER) says I'm HIGHLY constipated. Made me drink a whole bottle of Magnesium Citrate. Threw it up 45 minutes later. I bought myself another bottle and sipped half and finally pooped about 6 hrs later. I made an appointment for a GI spec, who's apparently the best, but I have to wait like 3 weeks. Everyone is also booked in town. \n\n5 days later, trying to pass at work, and it hurt so bad and was soooo large, I was shaking, blood shot eyes, red face. I left work for the ER, they gave me morphine (which I hated) and wrote me another referral. They also were shocked because no one prescribed me something to poo. \n\nWHAT WAS FOUND: Finally, specialist day comes for GI. They order me an EDG and Colonoscopy. The doc found my villi are flattening in my intestine, my stomach is showing some redness and irritation. Colonoscopy found two small (unsure which exact size) polyps. He cut them out and sent to biopsy along with bits every every part of my digestive tract.he also found 3 internal hemorrhoids that he says I should get banded and removed. They want me to have 4+ doses of MiraLax/day and Benefiber 2x/day.\n\nIt's been about a week since my procedure and my stomach is still so tender. I still only poo about 1 every 2+ days, which I guess is an improvement. \n\nMy diet was pretty bad. I am a huge Diet Dr. Pepper drinker. Which I quit when I got sick. Lifestyle changes are in the works. \n\nBut needless to say, I am terrified. I'm weak, I want to use the restroom so bad. I only found out half way through my pains, my great grandmother on my maternal grandfather's side had stomach surgery at 30, my great uncle had his stomach acid plugged or whatever. I can still feel every gurgle in my stomach and left side. \n\nI understand I need to wait for biopsies, but nausea, constipation, and everything does not seem to be a side effect of polyps. I have no idea what it means to have my villi not moving like they're supposed to. \n\nI know this is a long read, but thank you."

It has only happened about 5 times, always occurs at night, only lasts about 30 or 40 minutes, and varies in intensity. Basically, I feel extreme pressure in my head, rapid heart beat, and nausea. It feels as if my head is pulsing and about to explode. I\u2019ve just kind of written this off as an annoyance until a couple weeks ago when I had a severe attack. Here\u2019s what happened. I was calm, feeling fine when I began to feel slightly nauseous and unwell. I went to go lie down and then it hit me like a sack of bricks. My head felt as it always has only much worse. Then, I became unbearably hot and sweaty, which made me feel even more miserable. As it ratcheted up in intensity, I also got a strange metallic taste in my mouth. I could barely think or speak to the people around me, and it was so horrible it felt like an out of body experience. Eventually, I vomited, (for the first time since I\u2019ve had this) except I wasn\u2019t aware I was about to vomit. It just sort of came out once as if I was coughing up blood or something. A few minutes later, I threw up for a real, and after several minutes of that, I began to feel better slightly. As the pressure and nausea subsided, my whole body began to shake uncontrollably. I couldn\u2019t keep my arms and legs still, and my core was jittery as well. After that ran it\u2019s course, I felt better, only I was weak and my body broke out in hives. This attack was by far the worst one, which concerns me because what if the next one is worse? Up until this point, I\u2019ve only had nausea, rapid heartbeat, and intense head pressure. And only in one other incident did I have body tremors. I\u2019m very concerned by this and I feel as if it could happen again any night. The previous two incidents happened with two weeks of each other. Before that, it had been a year. I don\u2019t believe it is an allergic reaction, but I really don\u2019t know. It could be related to stress and anxiety, as it tends to happen after particularly stressful days. I don\u2019t believe it is a panic attack because while those days have been stressful, they weren\u2019t too bad. Also, I\u2019m not panicking during these attacks, and the symptoms are extremely physical. I just lie down, close my eyes and try to ride it out. I\u2019ve been scouring the internet and I\u2019ve found nothing on this, so I would really appreciate someone helping me out and telling me what it might be and what I should I do. Anything y\u2019all might me able to tell me will do."

        "reddit": "mid 20s, Male, 5'11, 200 ibs, white, few days, chest, anxiety with panic features (taking Ativan and Lexapro), nothing else.\n\nSo recently been diagnosed with some sort of anxiety disorder with panic features. Symptoms started 3 months ago (was having full blown episodes that rapidly increased in a time of stress until I settled and got help), and finally started being treated within the last month. I'm taking Lexapro daily and Ativan as needed right now. The past few days I've had a new weird sensory thing that I'm wondering is a normal symptom. I get like flashes (mostly at night when I'm more tired) where I feel a tingling and sometimes slight hotness with it in a non-focused region all over my chest. No pain, but it bothers me when I notice it. Ativan helps but doesn't make it go away.\n\nThe prior month I was having issues with touching parts of my chest and head that I felt like felt weird and I was getting a odd sensation when I touched particular spots. Medication is helping normalize that. Guess I'm just looking for anything I should follow up on if the symptoms persist. I've had perfect bloodwork, sightly prediabetic and slightly elevated liver enzymes at last checkup that doctor wasn't too worried about but I'm going to follow up on in a few weeks. Just want to know if there is anything I should be mindful of as I deal with this. Thanks for any advice."

While i'm sure anxiety is part of it, it seems like it's more linked to insomnia (which anxiety can cause) because nearly every time i had a bout of diarrhea i didn't sleep well the day before, if it all. I've always had trouble sleeping but it seems it's gotten worse ever since i've developed these symptoms, even though most of the time i can't sleep it's not because symptoms are making it harder. i still get some gas regardless of sleep but it does seem like even that is less likely to happen or less severe if i slept well the night before. I've even had some pretty heavy food that should trigger IBS symptoms and on the days where i'm well rested it dosen't seem to cause anything (apart from some minor gas but even drinking water gives me gas). Should i mention this to my gastroentorologist, and is there any other detail that might make it easier for the gastroentorologist to more precisely diagnose me or treat me? thanks."

When I finally do wake up, I'm confused, I can barely stay awake for more than 2-3 seconds, and then it starts all over again.  This will happen for 10-20 minutes, with me \"waking up\" into a hyper-realistic dream in my room where I'm experiencing a new bout of sleep paralysis 20-30 times, having nightmares the whole time and calling out as loudly as I can (a mumble, I'm sure) for people to come and help me, even if I'm completely alone.  \n\nThe worst is when I really do wake up and actually get out of SP but can't physically stay awake.  It's like I instantly get pulled back into sleep within seconds, after which time it starts back over again until I can manage to stay awake for more than 30 seconds.  This is the only time this ever happens.  When I wake up normally at night without sleep paralysis happening, it'll take 30 seconds to a minute to get back to sleep at least, and I'm not confused and in a stupor like I am after waking up from these repetitive episodes of sleep paralysis and false awakenings.  If I can manage to stay awake for just 30 seconds, it'll stop, but no matter how hard I try, it just doesn't happen.\n\nThis happens pretty much every single night, and it's been going on for like, a year and a half now.  I absolutely dread going to sleep, to the point where I now sleep with a light on and YouTube playing, which seems to make it less frequent, but my sleep quality obviously goes down.  I've knocked things on my nightstand over, I've embarrassed myself in front of friends and colleagues that I've had to share hotel rooms with, but most of all it's just absolutely horrifying.  I started having sleep paralysis about 5 years ago and thought it was interesting and enjoyable at first, but it keeps getting worse and worse, happening for longer, and longer, more often, more terrifying, and that feeling of complete stupor upon awakening is really disconcerting.  It feels like even with all my willpower I'm completely unable to sit up and keep my eyes open for more than a couple of seconds.  \n\nI've had other weird sleep phenomena happen to me within the same period, such as exploding head syndrome, nightly nightmares, increased frequency of unintentionally lucid dreams, waking up feeling paranoid/like I'm still dreaming, and a number of other things.  I also have a slight tremor that's gotten worse over the same period, as well as other small odd things I've noticed that have gotten slightly worse over time, like a really slight electric shock sensation and metallic ringing sound when I move my eyes back and forth that happens for a few days at a time accompanied by a slight flu-like feeling and worsened tremor every couple of months, I feel like I'm becoming more clumsy, I have decreased tolerance for heat and cold, I became depressed shortly after I started noticing all of these things, increased muscle tension (this is probably just my GAD or ASD, I guess), substantially decreased energy, mental fog (I just feel more stupid than I used to), and a number of other small things like that.  \n\nI've told my doctor about the sleep paralysis, he knows about the tremor, depression, and muscle tension, but I haven't told him about the other symptoms because I'm worried that they're caused by my worrying instead of the other way around.  I'm even nervous about posting this, I'm worried I'll sound like I'm a hypochondriac or something like that.  I guess I'm worried that I AM a hypochondriac, and that if I go to my doctor with this I'll just be wasting his time.  Do I just need to relax, or are any of these symptoms something that warrants serious consideration?  Thanks for your time."

The hospital conducted multiple ECG's as well as a heart ultrasound and x-ray by a cardiologist and nothing was found.\n\n With that been said following a blood work, I discovered that my phosphate was 0.37 in a value of 0.80-1.45 as well as my magnesium which was 0.71. I received an infusion of phosphate and was stable at 1.81 as well as my magnesium was stabilized. I was then followed by a nephrologist from June 2017- October 2018 and my electrolytes were stable and also my heart palpitation had disappeared.\n\n In April 2019 I began experiencing heart palpitations again and visited the emergency only to find out that my phosphate had gone to 0.50 from a value of 0.70-1.35 in which I was then prescribed oral phosphate to take for 20 days. Upon checking in with the doctor was phosphate was then at 0.87 in May  2019  my magnesium descended from 0.87 to 0.71 so I took oral magnesium pills and within one week they were stabilized. With that been said within May-June, I began experiencing panic attacks and anxiety brought on by my heart palpitation in April which continued once or twice a week. Upon going to the emergency an ECG was conducted as well as blood work and all was stable and I was given Clonazepam 0.5 mg to take as needed as well as vitamins in order to help keep my electrolytes stable. \n\nIn July 2019 I then had a Holter monitor test done for 24 hours in which I did not experience a heart palpitation and all was fine.

My gastroenterologist did give me 40 MG Apo Pantoprozole in which I take as needed since 2017 however I fear it may be descending my electrolytes and now as I experience heart palpitation while resting I do not know what else I should do or if this is likely dangerous?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks for the advice."

Nothing was pursued or concluded. Doctors final verdict: \"He is just a very tired kid, just let him sleep more\".

Prior navy and worked on planes). Also felt pressure alongside the right side of my head down the same side of my neck, but not necessarily \u201cpain\u201d. I had headphones in pretty loud so turned them off. Ringing went away, ear pain was barely there at that point so I finished workout at a lower intensity. The pain radiated from my ear up the side of my head and down my neck the next few hours. it almost felt like a had a sore throat on one side but it was behind it. I felt nauseous, fatigued, sensitive to light, and moody. The pain was very intense but not unbearable. Figured it was a migraine. The neck-head-throat area pain went away over the next 3 days.

That was Oct 2018.\n\nThe pelvic pain got worse afterwards and the stomach distension stayed. I basically looked pregnant non stop. \n\n6 months later I began seeing a new gyno, who suspected endometriosis or fibroids. The only medical family history I have is ovarian cancer, but that has not been found. We did a diagnostic laparoscopic surgery where endometriosis was deemed negative, but they found 2 inguinal bilateral hernias, one which had swallowed half of my uterus somehow(they took photos).\n\nI healed from the diagnostic surgery and 7days later had a second laparoscopic surgery for the 2 hernia repairs. That was May 31, 2019. About 10 weeks ago almost now. \n\nThe pelvic pain has gotten worse and stomach distention much larger. Im following up to get checked for adhesions and recurrence of hernia. \n\nBut from the ectopic pregnancy, to the hernia repairs, it feels that the original culprit of my chronic pain and distension never was found, I'm in pain everyday and have had 8 ct scans, over 20 intravaginal ultrasounds, numerous xrays and other scans, etc over the last few months and all come back normal. \n\nIm seeing a gastroenterologist who ruled out celiac (though my symptoms are there with or without eating), ruled out gluten allergy,  and next is gonna test for SIBO.\n\nIm seeing an immunologist, because I have a vitamin D 25 hydroxy deficiency, very very high AST and ALT levels, and very low blood sugar and pressure, but high potassium. I had a full metabolic panel done. \nSince my symptoms include hair loss now, extreme fatigue, recurring kidney and urinary infection(6 the last few months all separate..) and recurrent general infections he wants to test me for lupus, diabetes, and several autoimmune disorders. \n\nIm seeing a new surgeon for a second opinion to check for adhesions since I had 3 surgeries in 6 months, and 2 within 1 week, because a hard lump formed in my abdomen now. My pcp thinks i have hernias again too.\n\nMy question, with all my medical history explained here, is does anyone have any advice or insight to my current condition?\nAgain im being checked for numerous GI issues, many immune disorders, and hernia and surgery related complications.\n\nBut what is the cause of the original severe pelvic and abnormal pain and bloating/distension?\nI have a photo showing my normal body(where I'm losing weight and sick) vs my body with the distended abdomen (where I look 6 plus month pregnant). It only went back to normal ONE time the last year: after the surgery, where all the co2 and gas was pushed out and I had not eaten for days, and in that i lost several pounds somehow?\n\nIf I can post a picture id love to because it shows a 24 hour difference and looks like 2 different people. \n\nThank you if you read this far...\n\nTLDR; very bizarre distension and pain, then had ectopic rupture, 2 hernias and surgeries, and still the same issues months after, all doctors say my condition is bad but have no clue what it is and how to treat it\n\nEDIT PHOTO: https://ibb.co/p48Lsfb\ntaken 24 hours apart, the thinner version is my normal body without the bloat right after surgery, and larger distended version is my body 24 hours later when pain returned"

        "reddit": "Hi everyone. I am a 31 year old white female living in the Southwestern US. I am overweight (about 230lbs), and have a family history of high blood pressure, diabetes, stroke, and cancer. I am a heavy drinker (working on that), and ex-smoker. Writing all that down has helped put all my medical issues and risk factors into focus, and this most recent episode has definitely been a wake-up call. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, about 6 days ago (Tuesday, August 6), I woke up around 4am because my right arm and leg had fallen asleep. I adjusted my position, and fell back asleep. I woke up a few hours later (around 9am), and had the same sensation. After a while of being awake and feeling like my arm and leg were asleep, I started to freak out. At some point, the numbing sensation had spread up the right side of my neck, to my ear and part of my scalp. When I stood or sat up, I would get very light-headed and dizzy. My husband drove me to an urgent care clinic, and during the drive I had trouble focusing on moving objects outside the car, and could only focus on objects about 3 feet in front of me. I will note that my speech was fine the entire time, I had no facial paralysis or weakness, and no confusion. At the urgent care they determined I was not having a stroke, and they performed an EKG, which came up totally normal. They also did some blood work, and everything came out ok, including glucose, kidney function, vitamin levels, and whatever else they normally test for (I can include a pic of results if needed). My blood pressure was extremely high (not helped by the fact I was convinced I was dying), and I have been on the edge of needing blood pressure meds for a while now, so they prescribed me 2.5mg Amlodipine. They sent me home, and I spent the rest of the day trying to relax. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI woke up the next morning feeling the same way, and was too freaked out to wait for a doctor's appointment, so we went to the ER. They performed another EKG and blood panel, plus a CT scan to look for a possible tumor. Again, everything came back mostly clear (glucose was a little high, but they were not alarmed by it). They gave me a Sodium Chloride drip to possibly alleviate my light-headedness, plus 100mg of thiamine. I still walked out feeling the same way as when I walked in: pins-and-needles sensation on my right side, plus dizziness, blurred vision, trouble focusing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI went to my PCP on Friday, and she didn't have any answers for me, either. She said a pinched nerve would be a more localized sensation, and wouldn't affect my head. She did mention a condition called Pseudotumor cerebri, but I have not had any headaches since this began. She referred me to a neurologist, but I can't get in to see him until October, by which time hopefully this will have gone away on its own. Meanwhile, I have cut back significantly on drinking, and my blood pressure has gotten down to almost normal (134/86 as of my last reading, Sunday morning). I have also started taking a Basic B Complex supplement. Couldn't hurt, right?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI went back to work as a bartender Thursday afternoon, but am still having problems focusing and get tired very easily. While working, I have to sit down every hour or so, and my head just gets foggy. It almost feels as if I'm drunk. The peristhesia definitely gets worse with movement, as well. By the end of my 6 hour shift on Sunday I was limping because my foot was numb and almost painful. I feel horrible because I am not performing at work as well as I should, and it's not fair to the rest of my team. Today is my day off, and I feel ok, but I can't tell if it's really getting better or if I'm getting used to it. My hand was feeling almost completely normal until I started thinking about it. I also have not been very active this morning, so I'm worried it will get worse again once I get the day started. I'm just incredibly frustrated and scared. I wish I knew what was going on so I can get back to normal. Any insights or ideas are welcome. Thanks!"

This usually occurs all over the whole body. One minute I'll feel itchy on my scalp, the next it could be my legs. Sometimes the itch feels like a 'stinging' sensation. Other times it feels like a 'running ants' sensation, like something crawling on a part of my body. I always chalked this up to dry skin as I have a history of dry skin as well as terrible acne. Showers offer some temporary relief to the itching but it comes back not long afterwards.\n\nHowever, what I find unusual is that when I have these itching episodes, they are usually accompanied by muscle twitches in random parts of my body. \n\nI've had lots of blood work done for unrelated issues and two of my liver enzymes always come back slightly elevated; Bilirubin and ALP. This lead to an ultrasound which didnt reveal anything. I then visited a hepatologist and he didnt think there was anything wrong with my liver but had me get an MRCP scan done to check for PSC. Results were a bit inconclusive. Radiologist said there looked like there were signs of possible narrowing in the bile ducts but the hepatologist reviewed the report / scan and said that it seemed to be normal. I'm due another scan next year.\n\nI'm just a bit confused with all of this. Does this itching sound like its Liver related? Or is this neurological, considering I'm having muscle twitches also?"

A few years ago (2016) I had surgery to have my adenoids removed, a septoplasty, and turbinate reduction. It made breathing through my nose much easier, but I still mainly (due mostly to habit) breath using my mouth.\n\nThe trouble is, a lot of the time when I breathe using my nose it feels like I'm kind of suffocating, but *really* slow. It gives me an anxious feeling in my chest, and eventually I switch back to breathing through my mouth.\n\nI'm sure part of it is due to me being accustomed to breathing through my mouth, but I was wondering if there was some way or some test to determine if the air flow I'm getting through my nose is adequate?\n\nI remember when I was first being examined by an Ear Nose and Throat doctor, prior to the surgery, they shoved these sponges/wads way way up my nose, and I think they said they had Afrin in them. When they pulled them out I was *amazed*. I was breathing just as well with my nose as I was used to doing orally. However, the feeling I have now a few years after surgery isnt like that. I've never used Afrin because you arent supposed to rely on it, but I wonder if theres not some improvement that could be made. However, I have no idea what metric I would use to determine if what I'm feeling right now is enough.\n\nSide note: Would it be dangerous to artificially prevent myself from mouth breathing in the night? One of many issues I sought to eliminate by getting the surgery was mouth breathing at night, which makes my breath bad and dries out my mouth to an extreme degree. Would it be dangerous to artificially close my mouth? Would I wake up if for some reason my nose indeed is not enough by itself, or would I run the risk of accidentally suffocating completely? Im probably not going to do that, but I just figured I'd ask."

I have tried to keep it cool but still find myself being told regularly to chill, \u201cwhatever will be will be\u201d, but she\u2019s a little to \u201cdon\u2019t care\u201d attitude if you ask me.\n\n    I am thirsty for water, have been my entire life, I drink nearly 2 gallons a day regularly. I\u2019ve asked doctors and only thing to come from it was being checked regularly for diabetes but nothing coming from it.\n    \n    About 11 years ago I hurt my back at work lifting wrong, it\u2019s what caused the problems with my lower spine. Originally I treated it with physical therapy and pain meds. Eventually things got better, I lost weight to make things easier on my back and continued my PT at home and getting off the meds.  But things always seem to happen, I take a fall or lift wrong again and my back hurts all over and I kind of repeat the process every few years. Recently my new pain management spinal doctor suggest these epidural injections into my spine to relieve pressure and reduce pain. They work great, ive had it done several times.\n    \n    About 2 years (9 years ago) after my back injury I dislocated my knee at the park. It didn\u2019t feel like it hurt THAT bad, so I went home and then boom, it swells like a balloon to the point where I couldn\u2019t even bend it. It eventually healed up after a few weeks but it was never quite the same. I\u2019ve re-injured this knee problem probably 8 times since then, about once a year. I\u2019ve also hurt my other knee being so nice to the hurt knee, it\u2019s a vicious cycle.\n    \n    I feel these 2 injuries, and growing up in a gaming generation led to a very sedentary lifestyle. I played WoW for years, not often leaving my chair, and now as an adult I do most of my work still from a desk. It has led to obesity, and not a great body.\n    \n    I am also an alcoholic. I have been drinking regularly since I was 18, it was pretty bad for a few years, but I never had any issues to serious like needing to go to the hospital. These days I have about a handle (1.75L) a week, sparingly throughout the day, chasing with water, but this last year I have switched to drinks with more sugar like Gatorade. It\u2019s a terrible habit that I wish I didn\u2019t have, and I\u2019ve been trying to taper down off so I don\u2019t go into withdrawal and have seizures (something that scares the hell out of me). Despite my looks I do not enjoy sugar, I do not enjoy any kind of desert and I can feel when Ive had to much and it makes me sick to my stomach.\n    \n    I am also a smoker, In my early 20s it was 2 packs a day, now it\u2019s about just 1 cig every 3 days. I\u2019m so close to quitting, I\u2019m very proud of myself for that.\n\nMy blood pressure use to be hanging around 145/85 but now with medication I\u2019ve been around 130/80.\n\nI hope this creates a better image and can help diagnose a problem.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTHE ISSUE:\n\n    Third week of July 2019, I go to stay at my grandmas for the weekend (she is very old and I go every few weeks for a night or 2 to help her). Saturday night, in the middle of the night I wake up to very sharp pain on the tip of my left foot\u2019s big toe. This continues for over an hour, I get no sleep and never got use to it. That\u2019s when I notice my foot is also partially numb. I\u2019ve had bad circulation for years and having things go numb here and there was common. I write it off to too much sugar, or to many drinks, sometimes I slip-up and go to hard. This is what I continue to think as the next day I feel violently poisoned. \n\nAlcohol perhaps? Or the Sushi from the last night? No clue, either way I was viciously nauseas and actively gagging &amp; puking at every smell or hint of food while having severe diarrhea. This continue for 5 days! The different part about it though is ALL the liquids are coming out of my #2 and I\u2019m peeing very little despite tons of water being the only thing I\u2019m consuming. The pee is also getting very yellow, like lemon lime Gatorade.\n\n    It\u2019s now the 31st, day 4 of the sickness. I had been putting off a blood test for a follow up to check on my cholesterol and lipids. While at the office when its time to pee in a cup, barely anything will come out and it\u2019s dark brown. ( I also had to #2 at the office because well I was still very butt sick) I immediately go into full worry mode. I start questioning the physicians there if I should go to emergency, they ask if I take medications and I say yes and they say don\u2019t worry. Still though, I worry and hold off on my regular meds from now on. I get my blood drawn, go home and continue to be sick. The numbness is now on both feet and regularly tingles / sting with pain in different areas of my pads.\n\nAug 1st, My shins are now also numb. I\u2019m off to my spinal injection, with everything going on I feel like cancelling. I\u2019m told I\u2019ll get a chance to voice my concerns with my doctor before hand. While in the waiting room I get a call from my primary saying I have a UTI and she sent antibiotics to my pharmacy. I have NEVER had a UTI before and was shocked I even got one. The fianc\u00e9 thinks it\u2019s from holding in my urine to often. I get called to the back, my BP s 156/82, immediately laid down. I\u2019m still trying to talk to me Doctor before anything happens, but before he even says hello the injections are going in. They always pinch / hurt during. After he finished he walked right out, great bedside manner /s. While doing my checkout my BP is lower to 136/80. I chit chat with the assistant and mention my first UTI I just fond out about, she laughs and says she got her first as well a month prior, then asked if I was sick. She has a lot of my symptoms, I calm down with this knowledge. I then manage to catch my doctor walking by when I yell at him to stop and talk to me a second, I tell him about my numb legs and he says the injection should help reduce that. Spoiler, he was wrong. I leave, get my anti-biotics, and go home.\n\nThe next day I\u2019m already feeling better, my urine clears up, the day after I felt even more normal, except this numbness. It was hurting worse and numbing more. I was losing my balance.\n\nSince I hadn\u2019t had issues with dark urine since that day I started my meds again on the 8th I believe.\n\n    Fast forward to yesterday the 10th, the numbness is up to my knees on both legs, I can BARELY feel my feet, my hands also 50% numb now, typing this is much harder than it should be, and even my lips 2 days ago when numb. The only upside, is I haven\u2019t been sick. But now I can barely stand, I DO NOT feel comfortable driving anywhere, in fact just going to the bathroom is a struggle. \n\nIt was my Aunt birthday, my family is all at my grandmas and I\u2019m trying to act normal so they don\u2019t freak out and rush me to the hospital which is something they do regularly for many little reasons. We eat steak, chicken, asparagus &amp; potatoes. I manage to take a few bites of cake to make my aunt happy. My fianc\u00e9 eats roughly the same thing. We both hate it.\n\nWe get home that night, she has a night shift, I stay behind. I peed brown urine, it worries me, and then we both get sick, me more than her. She starts puking it work, while I\u2019m puking and diarrhea just like before at home. The nausea is very intense and we both have it.\n\nThe numbness is even worse, I can\u2019t lay on my sides or my hands get to numb, and I can\u2019t lay down at all without my left leg feeling WAY to numb, like I can\u2019t feel it at all. Walking hurts, I feel like I have little bb pellets inside my feet. My feet are COLD, but I can still move them even though they feel swollen.\n\nI haven\u2019t slept, I can\u2019t sleep. I\u2019m way to sick, and way to worried about what is happening to my legs &amp; hands &amp; lips.\n\nI had my first panic / anxiety attack last week, I cried but had my fianc\u00e9 to calm me down. Last night I was alone, I cried again.\n\nI\u2019m scared, Google makes it worse. I\u2019m worried I could have multiple blood clots from my sedentary lifestyle, or I\u2019m having a heart or spine issue.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPlease help\n\ntl;dr 3 weeks ago a painful creeping numbness started on my feet, now it's up to my knees and worse also my hands and lips. I have also been dealing with a sickness and anxiety attacks.  \nI have my primary Doctor's tomorrow to follow up on blood results but I need answers about the numbness, the following day I have a follow up with my spinal doctor.   \nI can't stop thinking maybe I should go to the hospital now, but its a 12 hour average wait."

I went to the ear doctor and got it cleaned up - it was a bit aggressive. Some time later, my ear started ringing and I had a sudden panick attack: my hands felt cold, my breathing got shallow, stuff felt slow and I had to sit down. I went to the doctor and they took a scan on my head. I have a deviated nose. They found a mass in my head but it was mucus they said. Anyways, I went to a few doctors. They checked my blood, they did the aforementioned head scan, and well some ear tests. I lost some hearing in that ear, can listen, but I have persistent tinnitus since then. A huge issue I had going forward was feeling very edgy, feeling dizzy when I was standing, sometimes having panic attack like symptoms that I managed to control, as well as weeeeeird headaches (they felt like pressure around my head, doctor said tensional headache), but sometimes it felt like it moved. Meanwhile, I\u2019ve had other weird issues popping up out of nowhere during my worst moments of these weird symptoms. For example, one night I had intense pain in the stomach. Months ago. Nothing happened. Another day I had pain in my arm, went to the doctor and said it might\u2019ve been a pinched nerve. It was not muscular pain. Anyways that was months ago. The doctor that did tests said it probably was anxiety. I tend to agree that since the ear problem I had a lot of health anxiety. The headaches were slowly going away. I touch my neck and feel some inflammation. It flares up and I start to feel some pressure again in my head (not as bad admittedly). The only symptom that had never gone away is the tinnitus. Anyways, I\u2019ve gone to the same doctor again. She\u2019s checking the neck, said I had a developing pharyngitis after she touched my neck which is a relief cause I was panicky.\n\nI\u2019ve been feeling that pressure a little bit. In the coming weeks I\u2019ve also had something weird develop: whenever I blush I feel like little pinches, wherever I blush. Today those weird panic attack like symptoms are here even though the neck thing isnt bothering. The pressure is very light, but my hands feel cold, my head a bit heavy and my hands are sweaty. I feel edgy.\n\nBefore this started I was a terribly calm guy. I admit health has been a strong concern for me and could agree it is anxiety."

It could be as simple as a few strawberries or half a banana...I\u2019ll throw it up. This will last usually a few months before my eating habits return to normal.. and then things will be fine again. Sometimes there\u2019s nothing that triggers my eating to go off tracks. It\u2019s pretty consistent in its time frames though. I\u2019ve done blood, ultrasounds ect and cannot figure out what is wrong. I have no idea how to stop it so when I go into my vomiting cycle I just avoid eating for several days at a time until I\u2019m okay again. Obviously this causes pretty drastic weight loss. I was reading about cyclic vomiting syndrome and it honestly sounds like me...except instead of getting stomach bug type bouts of vomiting for hours or days My body will just completely empty my stomach anytime I try to put food in it for months. Other than that the cycles of normal eating to vomiting following meals is me.. could this be it? If it is what do I do now?"

I underwent a Bartholin\u2019s cyst marsupialization, which went very well in the operating room, but quickly went downhill in recovery. \n\nIn recovery, I started bleeding profusely. Before the procedure and procedural sedation, the surgeon told me to expect minimal bleeding. I was quite loopy leaving the operating room, but definitely noted the bleeding and informed my nurse, who gave me what looked like 2 dog pee-pads and told me it was fine. I remember a pretty interesting experience in the bathroom where I was sent to change, getting blood all over the floor and desperately trying to clean it all up (I doubt I did a good job.) The surgeon never met with me afterward and I was released shortly after. \n\nIn the 10 min. drive home, I soaked through both pads and my pants. Once home, my boyfriend led me to the bathtub where I proceeded to lose a lot of blood. He called the surgeon back who instructed us to go to the Emergency Room. \n\nI was immediately given a room and waited several hours for the on-call gynecologist to come in. The head physician paid a visit to do a quick assessment and informed me that the surgeon had cut an artery. I continued bleeding. The gynocologist later estimated I had lost about a liter of blood. This all hit a head mid-operation (the gynocologist administered local anaesthesia and worked to seal the open wound), when I started to lose consciousness. My boyfriend was standing next to me and said he\u2019d never seen someone turn that shade of white. I\u2019ll never forget the extreme thirst I felt. The doctors eventually gave me a saline solution and I spent another 5 or so hours in the hospital recovering. \n\nI have no reason to doubt that I went into hypovolemic shock. Unfortunately for me, the hospital and staff do not have this on record. (I requested all documentation and they either excluded certain blood tests or never ran them.) I knew the situation could\u2019ve been avoided because a week later, the wound burst again and I was rushed back to the ER for a third operation. This time around, they administered the saline and another solution **immediately** to help with the loss of blood. \n\nI worry now of the potential unknown effects from the hypovolemic shock. Since my surgery, I\u2019ve had a significant increase in my anxiety and depression (I was never formally diagnosed, but now that it\u2019s impacting my job and relationship, I feel it is time.) I\u2019ve had much more \u201cbrain fog.\u201d I procrastinate more than I ever have before. And while I can work with a therapist/psychologist on these issues, I can\u2019t help but wonder if that experience of blood loss may have anything to do with this. \n\nI will work with doctors to sort this all out, but if any practitioner has any sort of experience or professional opinion, I\u2019d love to know. I am not looking for an exact answer, of course, but rather information to help guide me."

Left side of neck, top of left trapezius.\n\nAny existing relevant medical issues (if any): 3 bulging discs from C2-C5. My neurologist says they shouldn't be causing me pain because they are minor. I have also been diagnosed with hypersensitivity. (Any kind of light touch or specifically poking HURTS like crazy. My cats can't even walk on my legs without me crying.) I also get these electric shocks down my neck and it makes my head twitch. They are random, uncontrollable, and painful. I also have chronic inflammation from my neck to my shoulder. \n\nCurrent medications (if any): Gralise 300mg QHS (Just switched from gabapentin 600mg QHS 5 days ago), Tizanidine 4mg-8mg QHS, Tramadol 50mg TID PRN, Nortriptyline 25mg QHS (Just started 5 days ago), Ibuprofen 800mg QD PRN.\n\nIt all started about 5 years ago after I got pregnant. The weight of my stomach pulled my neck down and I had trouble sleeping. I would often wake up and feel like a had a kink in my neck that wouldn't go away. It was often sore and felt like it needed to be popped. I occasionally went to a chiropractor but felt like I needed it popped more and more often.\n\nAfter I had my child I started working at Dollar General stocking shelves. Lifting those 50 pound boxes from above my head down to the floor jerked my shoulder a lot and it made the pain unbearable. It felt like a burning sensation in my neck and left shoulder. The neck pain was also always on the left. This increased in frequency to the point that I was hurting even on my days off.\n\nI was drinking up to 3 red bulls and taking 3 aleve a day. I was also getting headaches at that time I figured it was from the stress. The migraines progressively got worse so I started taking Excedrin migraine. I started getting lethargic and shaky the more I took the aleve and the excedrin. I was also taking stacker energy pills just to push through all of the work. I found out years later that I'm \"allergic\" to aspirin and aleve. Not sure what the allergy is and neither are my doctors. I just know that when I take any NSAID besides ibuprofen that I feel weak and shakey and my chest hurts. I did this to work through the pain for 2 years. \n\nI got a call center job where I could sit down all day but sitting down made it worse. The longer I sit down the more pain I have in my shoulder. I went through 2 different call center jobs within a year because I was calling out due to migraines and pain. \n\nAt this point I started using a tens unit and various narcotics from ER visits. I'm sure they thought I was a drug seeker and eventually quit giving me any advice or trying to diagnose me. Throughout all of this I didn't have health insurance. They would take an xray me at the ER and tell me that I was fine. \n\nI ended up going back to college after the call centers failed. I knew that my health was declining and I needed to find a good paying job with health insurance. It took me another year after that to be able to see a PCP. \n\nMy PCP sent me to an orthopedic doctor. He did x-rays and told me that my neck was leaning forward and that I needed physical therapy. After I did the physical therapy with them and I felt no relief I got referred to a neurologist. The 1st neurologist that I saw wanted me to do Chinese cupping and acupuncture which I thought was a crock of shit but I tried it anyways because I was desperate. She also ordered a nerve conduction study which was negative for pinched nerves. But I would bet my life on that being incorrect. She also started me on gabapentin. I felt no relief from any of these things nor did I feel relief from massage therapy, tens units, stretching, yoga, nothing... She increased my gabapentin to 600mg twice a day and I started losing my vision. I wanted to quit but it made my pain worse and put me in the bed for a week so I had to stay on a low dose at night. I quit seeing her because I didn't think her treatment plan was going anywhere. \n\nI ended up seeing the same nurse practitioner over and over again whenever I would go to a migraine clinic for trigger point injections. This is a walk in facility that is owned by the same neuro facility I was going to. He ended up pulling my chart one day because I was crying and told him that nothing was helping me. He is the one who FINALLY gave me muscle relaxers and pain medication after 3 different doctors didn't help me. \n\nHe has been trying and trying to diagnose me. He is the first person to order a CT of my head and neck. Which came back negative for abnormalities. He also ordered a neck MRI which showed the 3 bulging discs. He said that we could try epidurals to shrink them back into place and see if it would help. I had 3 epidural injections on each of the C2-C5 discs each month for 3 months. I felt no relief from this. \n\nI think he started to give up because he referred me to another neurologist in the building that did guasha therapy. I tried that and it hurt so bad I left in tears. He was poking my shoulders and it felt like someone was punching me. I went back to the NP last week and told him my experience with the guasha therapy and the way the doctor hurt me just from touching the muscles on my back. He said it sounded like I have hypersensitivity. \n\nHe went to talk with the doctor that he works under and he suggested the nortriptyline and gralise and to get another neck MRI and a head MRI to check for lesions. So now I'm waiting for the hospital to call me and set that up. \n\nCommonly asked questions: Have you thought of surgery? Yes I would love for someone to replace the discs or try to cut the muscles apart and figure out what's wrong but my doctor says that a surgeon more than likely won't touch me. \n\nHave you tried _____? Yes I have literally tried everything. Here is a list. \u2022Chiropractor \u2022Ice/Heat \u2022Medication \u2022CBD/THC \u2022Yoga/Physical therapy \u2022Tracton devices/disc hydration devices \u2022Special pillows \u2022Dry needling \u2022Cupping \u2022Tens Unit \u2022Hot stones \u2022Massages, deep tissue, relaxation, neuromuscular, etc. \u2022Shoulder brace &amp; Neck brace \u2022Exercising, losing weight, etc. (Lifting 5 pound weights nearly put me in the hospital from pain) \u2022Trigger point injections \u2022Cervical Epidurals \n\nHow many migraines do you get a month? At least 5 big ones.\n\nHow is your pain on a normal day? My pain is never below a 6. When it gets to a 10+ I just take every medication in my arsenal and knock myself out for as long as possible. I have literally begged my husband to knock me out before. \n\nI'm hopeless at this point and not expecting to ever find a cure for my pain. I'm in debt and my spirit is just broken due to all of this. If anyone has any ideas of what we can try I'd greatly appreciate it. \n\nTLDR: Symptoms are neck pain on the left side that feels like a burning bruised soreness all the way from the muscle to the bone. Left trapezius pain up at the top running up into my neck. It is inflamed as well and spasms. The knot is always there and rarely responds to muscle relaxers and does not respond to trigger point injections or massage. Headaches from the shooting neck pain, also only on the left side. Sometimes I get pins and needles in my left arm going down into my hand. I also get electric bolts shooting from my head into my neck once again only on the left side. I can only lift 5ish pounds with my left arm without feeling pain in my shoulder and pulling my neck. I can lift whatever I can get a good grip on with my right hand alone without feeling much discomfort or complaint from my left half. \n\nTLDR the TLDR: The left upper half of my body freaking hurts."

I'm about to paint the other nails right now and was just wondering if I can do that one, too. Thank you!"

I have had this issue with my breathing for a while, and I can't really remember when it started but it has been going on for years. Recently, it is becoming a huge issue. Often, when I'm breathing, I start feeling like even though I am breathing, I'm not getting enough air/the feeling you get when you take the first breath after holding your breath, but constantly. The deeper I breathe to get more air, the worse it gets. I do have an anxiety disorder, but this does not occur when I am anxious/ having a panic attack. Often, anxiety is triggered by this feeling of not being able to breathe, not vice versa. It definitely started before I was taking any medication. I have never been checked for asthma, because I have never had an asthma attack, or what I think is an asthma attack (although these may well be asthma attacks, idk). Recently, it has gotten worse and more frequent, and I really need help. My parents don't know because I am not sure how to tell them that this has been going on for years and I just never told them.

        "reddit": "This may be a long post, and for that I apologize. I have no medical insurance and am unsure what to do about a sudden change in my health.\n\nI am 44 years old, female, weight aprox 125-130, 5'4\" tall, ex smoker of cigarettes, history (ancient) of amphetamine use. Familial history: mom has something related to lupus.. Aunt has MS, other aunt leukemia, other aunt breast cancer, sister fibro, grandmother RA. \nMy issue is twofold, i suppose. Number 1, I have hep-C.. Didnt know that until 2009 although drs determined at that time after asking me questions that i had probably contracted it when i was fifteen years old and had shared drug paraphanelia (spoon, like a fool) with an infected user. Anyway, i had a liver panel which showed i was a little off, but still within the normal ranges of whatever they look for. Im not sure what that means. But they said that the medication available to me at the time was not effective curing the particular type i have. I hear that now they can.. But again. No insurance and no money.\nPart two.. And the most worrying part to me is that I was working in my brothers field in rural Oregon during summer of 2014, digging thistle from his cowfields. (physically fit) I got bit by a tick im pretty sure? Ive never had one, but he has a lot of deer that live and bed down in his fields. I was wearing shorts and hiking boots, and something got me on my ankle. I have many pics here: \n  https://we.tl/t-DOSADpuTOs\n Anyway, starting maybe a year after that.. I suddenly started being exhausted by the littlest things. Like an indescribable exhaustion in general, and to the point of shaking sometimes with exertion.  I have always been a strong healthy person, did hard manual labor most of my life despite my size. Then suddenly within months, i can barely bring a bag of groceries up one flight without feeling like i will vomit from over exhauation... It feels like when you run too hard. Coupled with that is an inability to put thoughts together sometimes, achy joints that sometimes swell, flu feeling almost constantly, and now my eyes are suddenly.. And i mean very suddey.. Going to sh*t. I mean, within maybe two months i went from thinking my eyes were goopy and trying to blink it away, to now if i cover my left eye, i cant see anything but blur in the right. My left eye is bad close up, but clears a little at a distance. I also have pressure behind my eyes, like bulging, and pain. And one eye is more.. I dont know.. Rounded? Now.. Pushed out a little more than the other. Other strange things are a numbness and tingling in my arms. Often. Making my hands unusable which is bad, as I paint and olay guitar... suddenly weird smelling urine. Not sweet like diabetic smelling, and not just strong.. But weird. I cant describe it. Its not all the time. And heart fluttering. A lot. More and more frequently. And finally, now Im having weird feelings like something hard has been shoved up under my ribs.. Uncomfortable as it was when i was pregnant and squished in there, if that makes sense. I know this is a lot. And yes im getting older. But i look and have always felt very healthy, and you dont suddenly age all in a couple months. A person knows their oewn body. This is worrying me. What do i do with no insurance? I dont want to clog up an er, but where else do i go? Should i even worry? Could it be serious.. Such as lyme disease, or (god forbid) liver cancer or MS? \nPlease, all advice is very welcome, and appreciated. Ask questions if needed!"

Also warning, for some people it is going to be too much information.\n\nFor a few years now, I (25f) have had pain during penetrative sex with my husband. It used to be not as bad, as I was able to motor through the pain when  he tried to enter me and the pain would stop after a few seconds. However, around 6 months ago, it really hurt when he tried to insert his penis around halfway inside my vaginal canal, I told him and we stopped right away. Since then we tried a few more times, but due to high amounts of pain, we always have to stop before he can fully enter my vagina. I also noticed that the pain starts to happen in the middle (?) of my vaginal canal, not right at entry. It feels like my vagina kinda closes the gate for entry and all muscle contract to make it impossible to enter for him. \n\nI have been diagnosed with endometriosis around 10 years ago, and since diagnosis had two operations for the removal of cysts and endometriosis itself (one around 1.5 years ago and one 10 years ago). I have been taking the pill continously (with a one week break every 6 months) as this was recommended by my gynecologists after the diagnosis. I know that pain during sex is common with endometriosis, however I did not start to  have problems during sex up until 5 years ago. \n\nMaybe for further information, I also feel pain when I masturbate with a vibrator, although the pain is considerably less, because the vibrator is a lot smaller/thinner than my husband penis.\n\nI hope some of you are able to help me, I feel like I am in a vicious cycle of trying to have sex, experiencing pain, therefore not wanting to have sex, trying to have it again....My husband has been great in all of this, we have been having non-penetrative sex regularly, but he is very scared to hurt me again, so we pretty much stopped trying to have penetrative sex.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGeneral information:\n\nHeight: 165cm (5\u2032 4\u2033)\n\nWeight: 55kg (121lbs)\n\nRace: Caucasian\n\nDuration of complaint: 5 years (pain started), 6 months (pain got unbearable)\n\nLocation: Europe"

Everything came back normal (bloodflow is fine, no swelling, torsion, etc). The ultrasound showed nothing out of the ordinary and my urine cultured no bacteria and was negative for STDs. I usually have lower abdominal pain that accompanies then testicle pain. I workout 6 days per week so I was suspicious of a hernia, but I have no lump anywhere. The pain in my testicles is mostly on the backside of the right one, but it is also my left one. The pain is worse when sitting in a car. Originally the pain was worse after lifting weights, so I stopped for the first week and a half. But now I am lifting weights again and the pain seems to be the same constantly. Thank you.\n\nEdit: the only other symptom I have had is slight testicular redness."

It was centered mostly at my sternum and almost unbearable to roll my shoulders forward or bring my arms together or lift anything more than ~10 lbs. I gave the weightlifting a rest for a week and the soreness improved each day. But it would worsen with physical activity that increased my heart rate which would sometimes set off the feelings of palpitations/doom/sweating/paleness.\n\nAfter that first episode of the chest pain being accompanied by the other symptoms, I saw my primary physician who sent me to a cardiologist that same day. 12 lead EKG, bloodwork, and a follow up echo treadmill stress test came back normal. They did not do a chest x-ray or Holter monitor. Cardiologist thought maybe it was just anxiety/stress.\n\nIt decreased in severity and went away almost entirely in the weeks after that. But after finally resuming upper body weightlifting that involves the chest to some degree two weeks ago (namely benchpresses but avoiding dips entirely), I've had two recurrences of the midsternal chest pain accompanied by palpitations/sweating/paleness/doom and both times while I was at rest and had my arms folded across my chest. Once when I was sitting down at work and again when I was sleeping on my side and woke up to the pain and found I'd fallen asleep with my arms crossed."

        "reddit": "**Long post, but I really need help. I deeply appreciate everyone that will take some time to give their advice. This situation is causing me to waste my life, I'm unable to properly function, and I can't stand it. Please, please take time to speculate and give me suggestions for what I could try.**\n\n* Age: 30\n* Sex: M\n* Height: 1m84cm / 6ft\n* Weight: 78kg / 170 pounds\n* Race: caucasian\n* Duration of complaint: 2-3 years\n* Location (Geographic and on body): northern europe\n\n**Overview:**\n\nHi reddit docs,\n\nI've been having an issue for about 2-3 years now that's slowly ruining my life.\n\nBasically, the problem boils down to having a chronic nasal congestion. It's as if my nasal passages get inflamed after I eat. The only way I get through is if I'm on nasal sprays 24/7. If I use a nasal spray and eat, I get a runny nose instead of congestion. If I don't use nasal spray, I just get congested so badly I'm unable to breathe.\n\nThis also results in chronic fatigue, my brain not functioning properly and sometimes painful eyes. I used to think I just suffer from some unexplained chronic fatigue, but only after I experimented with water fasting I came to the realization that congestion after eating food is my issue.\n\nHere's how water fasts have temporarily healed me. I've done one 82h, one 55h and one 12 day water fast. Every time, about 8 hours after my last meal my nose starts clearing up, but I'm still addicted to the nasal spray, normally for until about 48 hours after I start fasting, but at 48 hours my nasal passages have cleared up enough that I'm actually able to stop using the spray. Interestingly, the left side of my nose is always more blocked than the right side. It seems to me the nasal passage is narrower, but if it's not inflamed it's totally wide enough. When I stop fasting, then I can eat normally for about 20-30 days without chronic congestion and the use of spray, BUT, every time I eat I still get a runny nose! I can feel the congestion slowly getting worse over time, and in about a month I'm always back to using the spray. At first only in the evening before sleep, but in about 6 weeks I'm using it every 4-6 hours. And then to cure myself again, I'd have to go on water fast (which I'm sick of btw).\n\n**When did it start?**\n\nI've been using nasal spray regularly for about 2-3 years, can't remember precisely, but I do remember my breating starting to slowly get worse about 5 years ago. At first I only noticed it when flying on airplanes - I'd start getting terrible pains during the landing. I googled it, realized it has to do with nasal congestion, started using sprays just on airplanes. That fixed it. I then moved into a tropical country where I used aircon every night. This made the congestion worse and over time I started using the spray regularly at nights to sleep. Then I moved to europe, quit using the spray, though I did notice that my breathing had again gotten a little worse. Nothing to prevent me from living though. I then moved back to SE Asia, lived with aircon again, started using the spray again at nights, but it slowly got worse and worse. Moved back to europe, addicted to the spray 24x7 now, all the time, except when I do water fasting.\n\nNow, I realize it may seem like I'm just addicted to the nasal spray thanks to the use, but honestly, that's not the case, because when I water fast, everything clears up nicely. I can simply see that my breathing has slowly gotten worse and worse over about 5-6 years and that's why I've started using the nasal spray in the first place. Remember: when I stop eating, I can stop using the nasal spray. Every time I eat, I get either congested, or a runny nose.\n\n**What I've already tried-tested:**\n\n* I quit gluten completely. That has benefitted me with my chronic fatigue quite a bit. 5 months already.\n* I quit dairy, that was a BIG one for me. I'm pretty sure I'm lactose intolerant because every time I eat dairy I get congested as f...\n* I've eaten lots and lots of probiotic foods and supplements thinking it may have something to do with microbiome\n* Did a course of digestive enzymes\n* Incorporated heaps of superfoods and fresh juices in my diet, organic\n* I've done various supplements including magnesium, multivitamin, zinc, spirulina, chlorella, iodine, fish oil, probiotics.\n\n**Other things I've noticed about my health that may help with diagnosis:**\n\n* When I eat dairy, it has a massively negative impact on me. I used to suffer from rectal bleeding, bright red blood on paper, and frequent, small stools. When I stopped dairy and gluten, that issue has gone away. Could this be IBS / UC or something like that? If so, could there be a correlation with nasal congestion?\n* I used to drink coffee every day, then I quit. When I started drinking coffee again, after about 2 weeks I noticed it made the skin on the knuckles of my left hand extremely dry and cracked. I quit again, the issue resolved. I started again, the issue returned. I quit again, it resolved, I started again, it returned, but this time on the elbow on my left hand instead of knuckles. I quit again, it resolved. Haven't started drinking coffee again.\n* I have significant issues with insomnia, not sleeping enough, waking up too early or in the middle of the night. Luckily, supplementing with st john's wort has helped with that significantly. I'm currently on st john's wort.\n* I don't tolerate apple cider vinegar at all, it has a hugely negative effect on my cognition, to the point where I need to go and lay down.\n* I sometimes get a low-grade fever and can feel inflammation in my body that also seems to correlate with eating, but I haven't been able to pinpoint what foods specifically, if any.\n\n**Other notes-thoughts-questions:**\n\n* To me it seems it clearly has something to do with digestion, as when I stop eating, the problem goes away. But any time I consume anything but water, I get a runny nose, even organic, freshly squeezed juices. Also, I don't tolerate dairy and coffee, pretty sure gluten is bad for me too.\n* Could it be some sort of a virus? If so, what should I get tested for? I did take parasite medicine after I left asia just in case, so I doubt it's that.\n* I haven't taken an STD test in a while, could it be that some sort of an STD has that type of an effect? No other reasons to suspect an STD though.\n* Could it be lyme's? It's been a long time since I last had a tick, but I've heard people getting lyme without ever finding ticks on themselves?\n* Any other tests I should/could run? Thanks for not being able to function properly, I'm extremely low on funds and can't just go out there and have every possible test, but if you think there are some I really should take, I'll try to find the funds.\n\nEdit: I also suffer from post-nasal drip at night, at least if I'm using nasal spray. If not, I'm just congested af. This issue too, goes away for about 4 weeks after I do a water fast.\n\nI deeply appreciate every single one of you that takes time to read it, and even more those that take time to respond."

        "reddit": "I have been living in my worst nightmare for over two years now. It started in March of 2017 when I was 19. I\u2019m 21 now, weigh 150lbs. Male. About 5\u20196.\n\nI post online periodically just waiting for someone to have a light bulb moment. For someone to suggest something that hasn\u2019t been looked at yet. Truth be told I have been cleared by psychiatrists (thinking there was an anxiety or stress base to this) and have seen multiple neurologists, two rheumatologists, have had two PCP\u2019s. Nobody can figure this out. Yet the origin is clear \n\nI was being given meds to fight off a psych reaction to another med that I was given to help my Tourette\u2019s. I have practically no known medical issues aside from the tic disorder. They gave me a combination of celexa and Topiramate. Low dose of each and I only took them for 5 days total before my case started. Went cold turkey after that\n\nI experienced handfuls of bad side affects immediately from taking them. Far worse than they should be for a regular healthy 19 year old. Lost 15lbs in 5 days sort of bad. Nausea, headaches, toes falling asleep, lethargy and weakness, the weight loss. My body didn\u2019t like them\n\nI was a medical marijuana patient and I decided to use that to help my side effects so I could eat and sleep better. First night it was fine.\n\nI went out on day 5 and after a few hits my entire body got paralyzed for about 10 seconds. My vision was shifted to the side and my entire body clenched up and I could not move. It faded off randomly and I went back inside thinking it was nothing\n\nMy body then broke out into my condition. Given, some symptoms were relative to the meds and weed. The important symptoms was my leg muscles(?) clenched up burning and stinging. It felt like my legs were being stabbed to death with sharp knives internally. My heart was palpitating very strong, my body shivered and I felt frozen. My head was absolutely on fire. We assumed it was just a bad trip on weed. It wasn\u2019t.\n\nIn present time my entire vascular system feels like it\u2019s being overworked (temporal arteries burn 24/7, my heart feels like it regularly beats too hard) and this muscle nerve pain thing in my legs on top of heart palpitations is triggered by stimulation. I also get numbness and tingling in my hands/arms/face from stimulation too. Meaning when I get excited, drink caffeine (yes clearly weed too but I don\u2019t go near it and haven\u2019t since) physically exert myself, take any kind of medicine that interacts in the body. Strength of trigger dictates my symptoms.\n\nWe cannot figure out any general origin. Brain MRI normal but with scattered white foci. Bloodwork all normal. Vascular system on test has no inflammation. EMG normal. EEG normal. Psych evaluations show no origins or influences on this. All my other tests have just been normal\n\nWe don\u2019t know what went wrong but something did. Something interacted among the combination that has left my body a mess. Stimulation or interactions in my body leads to pain and all this numbness and tingling and stinging.\n\nIs there ANYYY possible spinal origin? Maybe an unnoticed asymptomatic condition that could have flared up from this?\n\nTruthfully my brain should not have been hurt this bad from the mix. Not to this extent. There\u2019s something we aren\u2019t thinking of it\n\nLet me know your thoughts \n\nThanks in advance to everyone that reads this and helps out"

Before I go on, I\u2019m not a native English speaker so I\u2019m very sorry if I make mistakes here and there. And also I\u2019m sorry if my post is disorganized.\n\nIt all started two months ago really, when I  realized I have been experiencing deja vu\u2019s as if it\u2019s the norm. It\u2019s very unnerving, when you face through deja vu\u2019s each day and before going to sleep, you have this god awful feeling that maybe... maybe something really, really bad is coming your way. That\u2019s how I felt anyway and let me tell you, it\u2019s taken a toll on my mind ever since. I feel very conscious about myself and what\u2019s happening around me as if something bad is coming. That\u2019s when I started to develop something akin to cherophobia (is that how it\u2019s spelled?), a phobia where the person having such disorder is scared of feeling happy because it may follow up with something negative.\n\nI\u2019ve read that an average person would experience a deja vu at least a year and those who experience a lot are either under extreme duress or have mental illnesses. I wish it was the former and yet, I don\u2019t feel like what I\u2019ve been through for the last couple of months or years are somewhat very stressful.\n\nApart from that, I\u2019m a very anxious person at times. When I get the hint of something that can go wrong, I will be genuinely scared. My hands tremble a little, I start to sweat a lot and I feel dizzy. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s an anxiety disorder or not which is why it concerns me a LOT.\n\nAnd last but not least... I have a strong facade that I hide under. I can make my face expressionless and it\u2019s what I do most of the time. Maybe because I feel emptiness sometimes.\n\nI really hope it\u2019s nothing serious. \n\n\nTl;dr \nConcerned for my mental health. Experienced a lot of deja vu\u2019s that has taken a toll on my mind.\nI feel emptiness. I get anxious really quick and easily."

During this whole process I have been \"diagnosed\" with anxiety, depression, bipolar disorder, PTSD and OCD.  I have taken so many different medications and have been waiting for that \"ah ha\" moment when I suddenly feel better or different in a positive way.  I have trouble collecting my thoughts and I am always tired.  I am constantly seeing on social media and video after video where someone has overcome their mental illness and just graduated college with honors or turned their marriage around and having great success in life in general.  Of all the mental health professionals I've seen I have yet to connect with one of them.  I am currently on Medicaid and it has been the only great thing about all this because I've gone from one medication to another.  I understand that my options (with medicaid) are limited but I don't believe that to be an excuse for poor care or impersonal care.  Things I do know about myself is that I have anxiety.  Just recently I mentioned to my doctor my \"manic\" mood changes where I feel motivated about something and then I loose focus and can't think.  I try and focus on one dream at a time and then I think I'm superwoman and then I crash because my brain can't hold that many thoughts.  I thought of ADD or ADHD.  I feel alone and isolated and I am the only one feeling that I just wont get it right.  I am 32 years old, smart, educated and hopeful but I am also sad and discouraged and almost ready to give up.  If ANYONE is going through the same thing PLEASE reply.  Feeling anxious and symptoms of ADD feels like an oxymoron and I feel like I am going nuts!  Thanks for reading."

Surgeon suggests surgery. 2 weeks later i get a laproscopic nissen fundiplication full wrap. It has been 2 years since the start of inital cough.\u00a0\n\n\nThe moment im awake and swallow water and beef broth for the first time im like its still happening.\u00a0 Nothing is better.\u00a0 The surgeon says to wait until swelling goes down.\u00a0 Two weeks later im suffering from bronchitis laying in bed recovering from a horribly painful surgery while i have non stop reflux and coughing still.\u00a0 2 months later still the same problem.\u00a0 They check the wrap and tell me everything is looking good.\u00a0 I say im still choking on this shit and the surgeon says \"well this surgery works.\u00a0 Good luck.\"\n\n\nIt has now been 5 years since the day i can pinpoint my cough starting.\u00a0 Im miserbale most of the time.\u00a0 Most people think im nuts.\u00a0 I suffer continuously from coughing up yellow sputum from my lungs.\u00a0 It happens right after i eat or drink.\u00a0 Water or thin liquids make it happen the worst which sucks since i work outside in the summer and cant get dehydrated.\u00a0 I dont drink alcohol or caffeine. The problem seems worse when im awake and standing up and better at night when i sleep.\u00a0 Ive tried hundreds of things over the years...treatment for h. Pylori, drinking aloe juice, apple cider vinegar, etc etc etc.\n\n\nI recently took gabapentin at suggestion from my physician after reading an article about reflux that is not fixed by fundiplication.\u00a0 It did not work and if anything made me worse.\u00a0 He has suggested a SSRI.\u00a0 i feel he thinks this is psychosomatic. Ive had horrible reactions to ssris in the past (in my mid 20s)\u00a0 and have been terrified of them since.\n\n\nHere is the thing....there is only one thing that i KNOW has helped in all this time.\u00a0 I recently went a vacation to gamble and a friend offered me some cocaine.\u00a0 I binged it for several days and noticed that shortly after using it my swallowing and coughing problem went away.\u00a0 This caused me to purchase some and use it daily for a weekish of time.\u00a0 When i would stop using the drug for a day or more the problem would very slowly return until it was back at full force 3 or 4 days later.\u00a0 Start the cocaine again and once againt the problem would go away. I originally thought it must be one of the following: it dried up my nose, or it numbed my throat, or it effected my brain in some manner that resolved the problem.\u00a0 So i did an experiment and stopped snorting the powder and instead \"boofed\" it (disolved the cocaine in water and squirt it up my bum).\u00a0 It still had the desired effect of making the health problem go away and now i could rule out its effects on my nose and on my throat.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nSo here is the question....what is the cocaine doing to stop my problem?\u00a0 Is there an analog that would work to do a similar thing that is not a black market drug?\u00a0 Is there a drug that can help me that wont make me a cocaine addict?\u00a0 Im at my wits end with all of this and now the only thing that helps me is an addictive stimulant drug.\u00a0 Im afraid to ask my own doctor about this.\u00a0\n\n\nPlease help.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nTLDR - cocaine is the only relief\u00a0 that i get from laryngopharyngeal acid reflux (lpr) and i am desperate to find something with a similar mode of action that i can try.\u00a0\u00a0"

My further back medical past also includes a couple of incidents of anaphylaxis (none since 2015), a bout (8 months) of optic neuritis with know known cause that still flares up from time to time (no MS, MG, 2x MRIs in the last decade), asthma attacks (but none in 3 years? a lot of Prednisone in my life as a kid/teen), a history of ovarian cysts, and meralgia paresthetica (which usually only bothers me if I wear jeans). \n\nCurrent medications: lexapro, multi\n\n\nHi Reddit.. 29/F/CA here. \n\nMedications: vitamin D, multi, lexapro\n\n\n\nIn July I started a medically supervised VLCD (and am now down 15lbs!) but at the start they did labwork. The results were normal for everything (it was a cholesterol and glucose panel) except an extremely elevated CRP of 48. The doctor didn't seem extremely concerned, but when they transmitted the results to my PCP she asked me to come in. We talked about any outstanding medical issues (how was my asthma? Still well controlled) (how is my ankle? still painful but not swelling nearly as much post 2 surgeries, no sign of infection at surgical site) (how is my mental health? normal). She also did basic neurological tests (follow the light, hold up you hands, is pressure the same?) and checked my joints for mobility and and swelling. Seeing nothing unusual, she ordered repeat labwork which just came in today.\n\nMy CRP is still elevated at 40, and my ESR is at 45. The rest of my CBC was normal. She's unsure of what to do next considering I don't really have any symptoms of anything concerning (no rashes, fever, high blood pressure, elevated HR, etc), so she's just suggesting to repeat in a month.\n\nUnfortunately, my anxiety is causing me to jump to all of the worst conclusions -- small cell lung cancer (I grew up in a house of smokes), ovarian cancer (I've had painful cysts forever!), actually having MS or MG, lupus.. \n\nSo, I'm hoping some of you can put my mind at ease while I wait a month for my next blood draw. What other, less horrible things can cause elevated inflammatory markers?"

He sent me to do a pulmonary function test, bloodwork and a chest x-ray.  This all came back normal but I had a consultation with a pulmonologist.  After looking everything over and taking all of my information, he did not know why I was experiencing these issues so therefore blamed it on \"subconscious anxiety or panic attacks\".  This seems like a REALLY weak answer.  I'm well aware of what anxiety feels like and this isn't it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel like when I breathe IN I can NEVER get a full lung of air.  Like my diaphragm is restricting the expansion of the lungs.  I told him this and was ignored essentially.  The breathing problem comes and goes.  I've noticed it flares up after eating something acidic so my nurse friend (hopefully gf soon) told me it might be acid reflux.  My MD has shipped me Omeprazole but I haven't received it yet to try it.  I wake up at 3am sometimes and immediately be gasping for air.  When I yawn occasionally, I can not get to the \"point\" where you start releasing.  Yawns are just irritating to me instead of comforting since I can never finish one.    \n\n\nI'm really here for a second opinion or anything any MD might be able to suggest outside of reflux or anxiety.

I've already been to multiple doctors about this and already finished voice therapy for muscle tension dysphonia that began last year. I had acid reflux from eating out late last summer and successfully treated it within a month just raising the head of my bed a little, taking Zantac at bedtime, and other lifestyle changes. The ONLY difference this time is that I am on isotretinoin therapy. **Can isotretinoin delay the healing process of GERD/acid reflux and its related anatomy? I physically feel acid reflux, as in, I feel the acid rise up to my throat when it gets really bad. I've been told it may be medication-induced esophagitis by a different GI doctor on Reddit but I'm not sure if this is it since I physically feel the acid... maybe they're linked, I'm not sure... could someone elaborate on this please?** I have taken all the medications I needed correctly and made lifestyle changes, even more so than last summer, yet I can't find ANY relief from constant reflux. This issue is degrading the quality of my life and limits me on so many things and prevents me from partaking in my hobbies.\n\nI left a message with my dermatologist's office this morning asking if it's acceptable to pause isotretinoin therapy for 3 or so weeks to let my reflux issue heal.. I am starting my 6th month now and have about 22 days left of medication.\n\nThank you for your time."

        "reddit": "**I know this post is pretty long and pretty disorganized. Thank you to anyone who takes the time to read it and to give advice. Sometimes when the pain gets bad I begin having suicidal thoughts and it really scares me.**\n\n* Age: 18\n* Sex: female\n* Height: 163 cm / 5ft4\n* Weight: 43kg/ 97pounds\n* Race: Chinese\n* Duration: 3 months\n* Location: Canada\n\nOk, so this started around three months ago I would get random sharp pain where my stomache a few times throughout the day that lasts anywhere from a few seconds to a few minutes. I don't have a family doctors since my mom doesn't believe in doctors. So after a week of the pain, I went to a walk in clinic behind my mom's back where the doctor told me I most likely just ate something bad. However, the next day, the pain got worse and spread to other areas of my abdomen and went up to my chest and spread to my back. So I asked my dad to take me to another walk in clinic where the doctor told me it was just stress... My mom was not happy with me going to see a doctor. My mom only believes in acupuncture ,moxibustion , and meditation healing the body and getting the bad qi out of the body. She is even against taking Chinese medicine. My mom learnt how to practice acupuncture and moxibustion in China. So she did acupuncture and moxibustion on me for like a week. My condition didn't really improve. So a week after she stopped doing acupuncture and moxibustion, I managed to see a third doctor without her knowing. The doctor told me I was constipated and told me to start taking Lax a day everyday. She ordered for blood tests, abdominal ultrasound, and abdominal X-ray. I was in school so I was pretty busy so I couldn't get all the tests done until a month later. Around two weeks after I saw the doctor, my abdominal pain got really bad and my chest was hurting so I was short of breath. I asked my dad to take me to the ER where they did blood tests and urine tests but apparently everything was normal. Fast forward to a week before I finally got my ultrasound and x-ray done.  I was experiencing a little bit of vaginal bleeding even though my period wasn't supposed to come for another week. In reality, my period was late for two weeks. When went back to see the results for the blood test, x-ray and ultrasound, I was told everything was normal except the ultrasound showed that there was a lot of poop in my body which confirmed what the doctor said earlier: that I was constipated. However, they couldn't find out what was causing the constipation. I was thinking maybe I had hyperthyroidism since I have a lot of its symptoms, however, the doctor told me the tests show my thyroid is fine.\n\nHypothyroidism symptoms that I have are:\n\n* Joint pain (knees and shoulders) - I have had this since I was little\n* cold intolerance\n* fatigue\n* forgetfulness\n* random muscle soreness in limbs\n* heavy menstrual periods\n* trouble recalling things\n* memory loss\n* muscle weakness\n* slower thinking\n* anxiety (not diagnosed)\n* dry skin\n\nI have been having these symptoms for around a year.\n\nI know you are supposed to have weight gain if you have hypothyroidism, however, I have lost around 4-5 kg in the past few months.\n\nAfter a while, the pain kinda went away so I forgot about it. However, the day before my next period came, I got really really bad period cramps where my vision was blurred and my ears were ringing. (I have had this a few times in the past). After the period cramps, the abdominal came back. I was sure it wasn't period cramps because my period cramps are in the lower abdomen however, I was having pain all over my abdomen. I managed to see the same doctor as last time and since I was having bowel movements everyday that are smooth, she told me to stop taking lax a day and to start on metamucil. However, I stopped taking it after a few days since it didn't really seem to be doing anything for me.\n\nA few days later, I went hiking with my family. We came back from the hike and was eating dinner when I suddenly felt super dizzy and had blurred vision and ringing in my ears. I felt super fatigue and week. My mom wasn't gonna let me see a doctor, and in the state I was in, I couldn't go see a doctor on my own. So... my mom started doing acupuncture and moxibustion on me once again. I didn't want to do it but it's not like I could refuse. my mom is one of those scary tiger moms. Besides, I was so weak I couldn't really do anything. I was sleeping a lot. After round a week, I'm feeling less weak idk if it's because her acupuncture and moxibustion is working or if it's because my body was healing on its own or something else. However, ever since the incident at the dinner, my fatigue became worse and I constantly feel dizzy and I have a constant headache.\n\nAlso, in the week after the incident, I have notices that I would feel the urge to poop but when I go to the bathroom, nothing comes out. So I managed to ask my dad to buy me some Lax a day without telling my mom. I also developed a fever a few days after the incident which went away after a day-ish, it came back again after a few days then went away after a day-ish. I also developed a mild cough.\n\nSome of my other symptoms are:\n\n* acid reflux sometimes when I burp\n* limbs go to sleep easily\n* tingling feeling in teeth\n* constant headache\n* constant dizziness\n* head feels heavy all the time\n* brain fog\n* constant eye strain even after rest\n* dizziness, blurred vision and ringing in ears when I stand up or sit up\n* pain in right buttock (had this for maybe around a year -I can't really remember well)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have also noticed that I lose my balance easily.\n\nI was in depression two years ago and four years ago, un-diagnosed of course.\n\nI also have thought I might have ADD for years but never diagnosed.\n\nI have never been diagnosed with anything because of my mother's beliefs,  or should I say lack of belief in modern medicine and doctors.\n\nAs for what the abdominal pain is like right now, I have dull pain all over my abdominal, that spreads to my back sometimes. Sometimes sharper pain that travels, and sharp pain where my stomache is that comes and goes. I don't think the pain get better after bowel movement or worse with eating.\n\nI have a history of holding my poop in when I'm busy. I know it's really bad and I have been trying to stop doing it. Maybe that was what caused the constipation?\n\nI can also feel a lump on my upper left back that feels a bit sore, but you can't really see the lump. I'm not sure if this is related to anything I'm experiencing or if it's anything to worry about. my mom did cupping therapy and moxibustion on this a few times, idk if it did anything.\n\nSince the my tests results were normal, I don't know what I can do now. It has been almost two weeks since the dinner incident. Should I try to see another doctor? But I'm leaving for university (to another province) in less than 3 weeks. I really don't want to go to university in this state. Also, I'm afraid it would be hard to try to get a diagnosis with the medical services at university.\n\nOnce again thank you for anyone who is willing to take their time to read my post and to give advice. I know my post is really long and quite disorganized."

I have had issues since I was in middle school with sore throat, earaches, and low energy. At one point my primary care doctor had me wear special ear molds any time I was swimming or bathing as a pre-teen because I was going so often for ear pain. I feel like the ear pain/aches stopped around puberty and I didn't notice any relevant changes until the last few years. I have had 3 ear infections in the last year, and 2 pretty painful ear infections between 2015-16. The glands on my neck have been swollen pretty much since I was in middle school (age 11-13). I had bronchitis once when I was 18-19. I also have had upper respiratory infections several (3+) times in the past few  (3-4) years. I was told I was anemic around age 17 - iron deficient. I have also visited primary care doctors over the last 5 years (since gaining health insurance) 3 times for chronic fatigue, anxiety, and trouble sleeping. I was given a dosage of vitamin d - 50,000 units. Both times I was given this it was for a week and zero follow up.  I also mentioned to them that I have little to no stamina, and I tend to breathe very heavily, and sometimes it is painful with minimal work out. However, I am pretty active despite that. I have been a flight attendant since 2015 so I do I walk a lot, lift 30-40lbs regularly, and other aspects that come with the job. Outside of work I like to go outdoors, walk, ride my bike and longboard, and I do not live a sedentary lifestyle - except for when I am sick, which seems to be more often. I also can't remember the last time I slept a full night. I recently got a weighted blanket and it has helped some - but I do still wake up several times through the night. My biggest issues are the chronic fatigue, trouble sleeping, and the respiratory/ear issues becoming more frequent. I will also note the last few years I have had some dry scalp, it ranges from very little to pretty severe - where I have little scabs and red/raw areas without ever touching my scalp. I have combatted this a little with medicated shampoo, but it still happens here and there. As I said before, I have gone to primary care doctors and they really have kind of dismissed my symptoms and one even said \"I think you're just a couch potato and you need to eat better.\" My diet is generally pretty healthy. My husband and I don't eat a whole lot of red meat, lots of vegetables, very rarely do we have snack cakes and those types of food in the house. I do drink soda pretty regularly, in addition to water, club soda, and tea as my main beverages.  It may be surprising, but I have never smoked, I have never consumed alcohol. and I have never tried any drugs. I very rarely take medications.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs far as family history: Thyroid issues do run in my family, particularly in the women on my mothers side. My mother is diabetic, her mother was as well. My maternal grandmother had rheumatoid arthritis and emphasema (she smoked for 20 years). My mothers brother has asthma, diabetes, and emphasema (non smoker). High blood pressure with mother and maternal uncle. My uncles daughter has lupus, shes in her early 20's. My other uncle's (maternal) daughter has overactive thyroid, she is the same age as me. My father passed at age 55 from kidney failure and heart failure. He also had sleep apnea and used a machine at night for this - this was diagnosed in the last 2 years before he passed. His youngest brother passed in his 40's for the same issues. However, they both, had several decades of substance abuse including hard drugs and alcohol. My parental grandfather died in an accident at age 29, so I do not know my paternal  family history very well aside from my father.\n\n*edit* \nI\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s relevant to this but my limbs tend to \u201cfall asleep\u201d rather quickly. If I\u2019m simply sitting with my leg crossed for a few minutes it will fall asleep. My feet fall asleep quickly, my hands sometimes when I\u2019m just watching tv, from my elbow down if it\u2019s sitting on a pillow a certain way. It\u2019s somewhat concerning. My mother has nerve damage in her right leg, however, I was very young, but I do believe that was caused by a bedsore that was untreated during a 3 month hospital visit. So I\u2019m not sure if it is anything more than that."

Whilst having a neck ultrasound to confirm Hashimoto's about ten months ago I asked them to check the lymph node, too. They confirmed that the node was enlarged but said that it was nothing to worry about so I forgot about it. Hashimoto's was confirmed as I had evidence of autoimmune damage to my thyroid gland and iffy bloodwork and I've been on 25mcg thyroxine since,\n\nAbout two months ago I noticed two new lumps on my neck, roughly central, under my chin. One is very small, about 2-3mm, and very hard and round, the other is bigger and more irregular, around 12mm and longer than it is wide. They're not visible but easily felt - they're firm and don't move on palpation I've been meaning to mention it to a doctor at some point but just haven't got round to it.\n\nI get night sweats somewhat regularly; it comes in phases. I've always chalked it up to hormones. This past week I've had night sweats every night, sometimes waking multiple times a night. I've also been feeling particularly weak and lethargic. My energy levels are pretty unpredictable generally and I spend a lot of time resting. I thought the thyroxine treatment would improve my energy levels but I've seen no improvement since diagnosis. I've been particularly tired for a few days now but that could easily be down to any number of things.\n\nI've also been experiencing intense itchiness in patches on my hands and fingers for a few weeks.\n\nLast night I absentmindedly felt for the two new neck lumps to see what they were up to and noticed the larger of the two had gotten bigger and firmer. My perma-swollen lymph node also feels bigger. I've lost a bit of weight recently but not a huge amount - just a couple pounds over the last couple months.\n\nThis is probably not relevant but just in case: two months ago I was seen in A&amp;E for severe (10/10) recurrent gastric pain over the course of 2-3 weeks. Bloodwork and abdominal ultrasound came back clear. Consultant said symptoms half sounded like gastritis and half sounded like gallstones and called it a diagnostic conundrum. She recommended an MRI and gastroscopy but as the pain hasn't recurred since said it was fine to wait and see if it comes back. I was on 40mg omeprazole daily for 4 weeks.\n\nI also suspect I have exercise induced bronchoconstriction, or something like it. Running in cold weather has always irritated my airway and makes breathing difficult. Once in particular around ten years ago I was running outside and my throat closed up (not completely) and I wheezed for about half an hour before it resolved. Then around four weeks ago I was running for a train on a hot day and experienced the same symptoms but a lot worse: I felt like I had the tickliest throat I've ever had and my airway closed up so that I could barely take a breath. Trying to breathe made me cough uncontrollably. Pretty unpleasant experience but I assumed it was just my airway freaking out and that it would calm down eventually, which it did, and I resolved to see a doctor about it at some point. Again, don't think it's relevant, but as it's recent and I haven't yet seen a doctor about it thought it worth mentioning.\n\nOther diagnoses are: PCOS, ADHD (methylphenidate 10mg 2-3x daily), Aspergers, generalised anxiety\n\nMy main concern is having these new lumps in my neck and that they seem to be growing. I'm prone to health anxiety so I always double, triple guess whether or not I ought to see doctor. I hate the thought of wasting a doctor's time and looking like a crazy person (I know health anxiety is on my file somewhere). Thing is, I was right about my thyroid even though it took years to convince doctors to properly test me. I've read that only a biopsy is truly conclusive to rule out cancer in the lymph nodes so I'm less reassured about the ultrasound result than I once was. Do I need to see a doctor, and should I ask for a biopsy? Would an ultrasound or CT scan be conclusive? If I see a doctor and they tell me it's nothing to worry about without running any tests, would it warrant asking for a second opinion?\n\nObviously not asking for a diagnosis or anything like that, just some advice on how seriously to take the lumps, and how seriously to potentially expect a doctor to take them. Thanks!"

I also had severe almost sciatica pain.. it\u2019s actually what sent me to the gp in the first place because I genuinely believed all my other symptoms were anxiety related. I had dip tested my urine at home but my dips were out of date.. and they didn\u2019t give anything off. So just thought anxiety? \n\n\nMy gp did a dip test which showed white blood cells, inflammation (?), proteins and blood so diagnosed me with pyelonephritis.\n\n\nI went home with bucastem and coamoxiclav and instructed to use cocodamol (already have) when needed. \n\n\nTuesday went ok.. I wasn\u2019t throwing up and seemed to be feeling slightly better.\n\n\nOn Wednesday I began to throw up uncontrollably. I couldn\u2019t keep anything down and the antisickness didn\u2019t touch it at all. So I called the gp again. I was given an emergency appointment with a locum who I hadn\u2019t met before who did not dip test my urine but did say that my urine that was sent off on Monday did not grow anything and said that I had back pain not an infection. But she still called the hospital for advice, and the urologist asked for her to send me in. \n\n\nSo went in under urology but surgery took over my care as it was past 9pm before I was seen. \n\n\nI had a dip test again which showed similar results to the gp. However my bloods came back normal. \n\n\nDoctors treated it as pyelonephritis over night and I was given iv gentomycin, amoxicillin, fluids and painkillers. \n\n\nI then had an ultrasound today which showed no sinister abnormalities. \n\n\nMy nausea had gone by this afternoon and my bp and hr have returned to normal, so the doctors were happy to discharge me on oral antibiotics, with the same diagnosis. \n\n\nI asked the doctor whether I actually had an infection even though my bloods and urine culture were normal.. and she said it was unusual but yes. That sometimes this happens?  \n\n\nBut is this right? Or could my body be tricking me? I do suffer from anxiety which has worsened due to an ongoing event and my anxiety has manifested in physical symptoms before (ie shaking, chest pain, dizzyness). \n\nAnd the fact that the gp told me I didn\u2019t have an infection really stuck with me. Her tone of voice was a little accusing and now I\u2019m worried that maybe my body has actually made this all up? \n\nI have a few other symptoms that I didn\u2019t mentioned to the doctors because I thought they\u2019d think I was making it up because of what the gp said and that maybe they were not related or anxiety based?\n\nHeart palpitations (happens when the pain killers kick in) \n\nSlightly SOB (anxiety?)\n\nShooting pains up my upper back (anxiety/muscular?)\n\nFaintness when I stand up (anxiety?)\n\nNausea when I eat anything (IBS?)\n\nPeeing out blood clots (irregular periods?) \n\nCentral upper abdo pain (anxiety?)\n\nVery gassy (burpy) (anxiety?) \n\nI don\u2019t know. I feel so unwell and also so stupid. But could my body be tricking me?"

After a week of the pain, I went to a walk in clinic (I don't have a family doctor) where the doctor told me I most likely just ate something bad. However, the next day, the pain got worse and spread to other areas of my abdomen and went up to my chest and spread to my back. So I went to another walk in clinic where the doctor told me it was just stress...  Two weeks later, I went to see another doctor. The doctor told me I was constipated and told me to start taking Lax a day everyday. She ordered for blood tests, abdominal ultrasound, and abdominal X-ray. I was in school so I was pretty busy so I couldn't get all the tests done until a month later. Around two weeks after I saw the doctor, my abdominal pain got really bad and my chest was hurting so I was short of breath. I went to the ER where they did blood tests and urine tests but apparently everything was normal. Fast forward to a week before I finally got my ultrasound and x-ray done. I was experiencing a little bit of vaginal bleeding even though my period wasn't supposed to come for another week. In reality, my period was late for two weeks. When I went back to see the results for the blood test, x-ray and ultrasound, I was told everything was normal except the ultrasound showed that there was a lot of poop in my body which confirmed what the doctor said earlier: that I was constipated. However, they couldn't find out what was causing the constipation. I was thinking maybe I had hyperthyroidism since I have a lot of its symptoms, however, the doctor told me the tests show my thyroid is fine.\n\nHypothyroidism symptoms that I have are:\n\n* Joint pain (knees and shoulders) - I have had this since I was little\n* cold intolerance\n* fatigue\n* forgetfulness\n* random muscle soreness in limbs\n* heavy menstrual periods\n* trouble recalling things\n* memory loss\n* muscle weakness\n* slower thinking\n* anxiety (not diagnosed)\n* dry skin\n\nI have been having these symptoms for around a year.\n\nI know you are supposed to have weight gain if you have hypothyroidism, however, I have lost around 4-5 kg in the past few months.\n\nAfter a while, the pain kinda went away so I forgot about it. However, the day before my next period came, I got really really bad period cramps where my vision was blurred and my ears were ringing. (I have had this a few times in the past). After the period cramps, the abdominal came back. I was sure it wasn't period cramps because my period cramps are in the lower abdomen however, I was having pain all over my abdomen. I managed to see the same doctor as last time and since I was having bowel movements everyday that are smooth, she told me to stop taking lax a day and to start on metamucil. However, I stopped taking it after a few days since it didn't really seem to be doing anything for me.\n\nA few days later, I went hiking with my family. We came back from the hike and was eating dinner when I suddenly felt super dizzy and had blurred vision and ringing in my ears. I felt super fatigue and week. I was so weak I couldn't really do anything. I was sleeping a lot. After round a week, I'm feeling less weak. However, ever since the incident at the dinner, my fatigue became worse and I constantly feel dizzy and I have a constant headache.\n\nAlso, in the week after the incident, I have notices that I would feel the urge to poop but when I go to the bathroom, nothing comes out. So I started taking Lax a day again. I also developed a fever a few days after the incident which went away after a day-ish, it came back again after a few days then went away after a day-ish. I also developed a mild cough.\n\nSome of my other symptoms are:\n\n* acid reflux sometimes when I burp\n* limbs go to sleep easily\n* tingling feeling in teeth\n* constant headache\n* constant dizziness\n* head feels heavy all the time\n* brain fog\n* constant eye strain even after rest\n* dizziness, blurred vision and ringing in ears when I stand up or sit up\n* pain in right buttock (had this for maybe around a year -I can't really remember well)\n\nI have also noticed that I lose my balance easily.\n\nI was in depression two years ago and four years ago, un-diagnosed.\n\nI also have thought I might have ADD for years but never diagnosed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs for what the abdominal pain is like right now, I have dull pain all over my abdominal, that spreads to my back sometimes. Sometimes sharper pain that travels, and sharp pain where my stomache is that comes and goes. I don't think the pain get better after bowel movement or worse with eating.\n\nI have a history of holding my poop in when I'm busy. I know it's really bad and I have been trying to stop doing it. Maybe that was what caused the constipation?\n\nI can also feel a lump on my upper left back that feels a bit sore, but you can't really see the lump. I'm not sure if this is related to anything I'm experiencing or if it's anything to worry about.\n\nSince the my tests results were normal, I don't know what I can do now. It has been almost two weeks since the dinner incident. Should I try to see another doctor? But I'm leaving for university (to another province) in less than 3 weeks. I really don't want to go to university in this state. Also, I'm afraid it would be hard to try to get a diagnosis with the medical services at university."

I went on a 11.5 hour bike ride this past Monday. I stupidly made a slight adjustment to my saddle angle before heading out. About 1.5 hours into the ride my ride-mates and I stopped for a pee-break and I noticed it seemed my penis was almost totally numb. At that time I chalked it up to the cold weather, everything being scrunched into my biking chamois, and the fact that I had only just hopped off the bike. So we continued the ride through to completion. Immediately after the ride things felt the same as at that 1.5 hour mark, quite numb on the penis. I had expected things to get better after being off the saddle for a while but they did not seem to, which is where I started to worry.  At this point I was able to pee fine, I felt the sensation of my bladder just as normal. I was also able to get and maintain a firm erection, though it did seem to need more coaxing than usual, for lack of a better term.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFast forward to the next morning, and things do feel a little better. There was more sensation in the penis, but still I'd describe it as like 75% numb. This was this past Tuesday, and over the course of the day things seemed to improve again a little bit but not much. I am still peeing fine and able to get erections like normal. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMove on to Wednesday/Yestarday. Woke up and again things felt better, maybe 50% numb. Wednesday evening I took some advice and sat in hot bath to try and get some circulation down there. While examining myself in the bath I noticed this; while tracing my finger across the head of my penis, I could feel sort of a patch were there was more sensitivity than elsewhere, which I found encouraging. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nToday: Numbness still improving, I would say maybe 80% there. It's also hard to qualify the numbness now, because it's almost like certain sensations feel more like they used to than others. I have sort of weird light burning and tingling sensations today as well, coming and going lightly on my penis head and in my perineum region. Again scrotum and testicles seemed spared all this numbness, though maybe I was not examining them as close.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEnding questions/concern: So before all of this I knew that nerve damage and injury to men's sexual health was a risk factor in bicycling, I guess I just never thought it would happen to me. Things seem to be improving but, I want to ask frankly, can I expect a full recovery? Or will I just have to live with the fact that I may have permanently lost some sensitivity. This is the first time I have ever had a numbness issue on a bikeride, all because I screwed with that seat angle most likely :(. And is there anything I should be doing to help myself with all this? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI found this article, do people think this is what I am going through?

With all of that out of the way let me tell you whats been going on. For years and years of my life I occasionally get the feeling that something is in my right eye. This feeling can last for as long as a few hours. I went to an eye doctor three years ago who just gave me gel eyedrops and told me it should help. It barely helped. The sensation of something being in my eye finally stopped being so apparent and started happening less and less so I figured it went away. Over the past month or so I have been having that feeling again that something is in either my eye or my eyelid. \n\nNow we get to the real problem, about six days ago I was driving and started noticing my right eye was feeling very strange whenever I would look to my far left or far right. I figured I was just tired and needed sleep. The next day I get the same feeling as well as the feeling of pressure in my eye AND the back right side of my head (tender-ish to touch when feeling this). For the past six days my right eye has been feeling like this on-and-off and it is really affecting my life. It is making me feel like ripping my eye out of my head is the only thing that will help (obviously not doing that). I went to an Opthalmologist today and he said both of my eyes look fine and the only thing he saw was a little irritation on my eyelid , which he said may be causing the original feeling of something in my eye. He told me to use chilled eye drops and Zaditor to help reduce the minor inflammation of the eyelid, however he did not suggest anything for the major problem im dealing with. I am feeling very lost and hopeless, I really hope someone is able to steer me in the right direction on this subreddit. Apologies if my description for the way my right eye is feeling isn\u2019t perfect, it is a very strange feeling. Just feels like something is off."

At that point, my doc put me on the higher dose BC that I am on now and the 10 mg of fluoxetine.

I'm not even sure what kind of specialist would be good for this kind of Hormone Issues in a young person.

I recently checked and noticed a small lump accompanied by a small black dot, which looks similar to one I've had on the back of my leg for at least a few months.

I scraped it down gently and the little black dot came off, some pus leaked out and a few drops of blood, after this the lump seemed to have swollen a little and is kind of painful.  \nIt's the middle of the night and I'm freaking out right now, my friend said it could be a cyst yet when I Google it a lot of leads come up about cancer and I know I shouldn't Google my symptoms but I couldn't help it in this case, which led me to being really worried.  \n[https://imgur.com/a/lu4O8kh](https://imgur.com/a/lu4O8kh)"

Mainly when I'm laying down, actually. And I feel really weak for some reason, but also could run a whole mile. I kinda feel like I'm gonna throw up, but it usually goes away after a bit. It's really hard to breathe, too. I have no idea if it's asthma (which my dad and brother have), or something else. It just feels like my throat won't let me breathe normally. And it doesn't help that I manage to convince myself that I'm dying every time I feel something slightly abnormal. Sometimes my head will feel weird, but that's usually only right after I wake up. I may just be overthinking this, but I'm really scared I'm gonna suddenly have a heart attack and die or something.

And I'm not just talking about the usual culprits like my fingers and toes.  It's ALL of my joints from my sternum, back, neck, shoulders, elbows, wrists, pelvis, hips, knees, ankles, metatarsals within the feet, and other joints I don't even have names for.  It gets MUCH worse in the morning and standing to stretch and move tends to alleviate some of it but I usually sound like a rice crispy treat when I first wake up.  Mind you, I am NOT a flexible individual.  I'm moderately stiff on a daily basis, especially my left leg which my physical therapist (who was treating me for a 'twisted pelvis' which spontaneously occurred) described as \"Myofascial Inflammation\" which seems to have been a stubborn issue for that leg for years now with no resolution.  The physical therapy didn't really help.  My left ankle now pops without fail any time I climb the stairs.  I'll even be sitting at my desk chair, holding still mind you, and my shoulder will pop randomly back into place.  They don't seem dislocated before this occurs, but I do feel a distinct re-positioning of the arm bone (the head of the humerus) when it happens.\n\nSome of the joint popping is painless, but a lot of it is uncomfortable and slowly getting MORE uncomfortable as time passes.  My neck and fingers pop constantly anymore and it's to the point where it is so intensely loud when it happens that I have startled people by doing so.\n\nA couple months ago I had the flu (type A) and it took a couple weeks to resolve even with the Tamiflu.  I later ended up testing positive for the strep virus in my joints with high inflammation markers as well.  (This was well after my joint popping started.)  A round of antibiotics seemed to clear up some of the sudden excessive joint pain but the joint popping and general pain continued and hence a diagnosis of Fibromyalgia was made considering my extensive history of fatigue and pain.\n\nI am a waitress currently by necessity though I know VERY well that I need to get out of this profession as soon as I am able to.  I do not feel this is a direct cause of the joint popping as I have been waitress for 3 and 1/2 years.  I did go through a divorce last January and that contributed to a LOT of stress during the time that this popped up (bad pun...lol).  I also live at an altitude above 7,000 ft...if that is pertinent at all.  \n\nI have asked my doctor, repeatedly, about the joint popping but I get the feeling she is unsure what to make of it so she glosses over it in favor of more pressing issues and, as I have no health insurance, I haven't really pursued it much more as I am tolerating the popping and pain for the most part.\n\nI am curious about Ehlers Danlos Syndrome as I have read that it sometimes occurs with a less usual presentation as I am a very inflexible individual.  I just don't know if that's plausible, though I've been dealing with joint/muscle pain and fatigue for years, that this joint popping would occur randomly just **NOW** if I had EDS.  Who knows...\n\nI'm not in dire need for an immediate resolution for my problem as I have no health insurance and I am doing decently well tolerating it for now.  I am just infinitely curious and hopeful that someone might have an idea that I could throw at my doctor next chance I can.  That way I can narrow the search a little more, and when I'm better insured, pursue a specialist if I can.  Thanks!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr - ALL of my joints pop/snap excessively and it's getting more uncomfortable.  Recently diagnosed with Fibromyalgia due to a long history of joint/muscle pain and fatigue.  \n\n(I hope I didn't inundate you guys with too much information.  I tend to get excessive with details.

I have never been able to breath out of my nose well, I  get runny nose all the time, postnasal drip, and headaches daily and year around. It has recently come to my attention that this is not normal.\n\nFast forward to the past 3 weeks. I work in a building that frankly needs to be condemned. Leaking roof for over a decade, roach and rat infestation, and mold growing on literally every air vent. With hurricane Barry things got really wet and the mold exploded. People have been complaining about headaches, allergies, and upper respiratory issues. These complaints are not new but have become more prominent in the past 2-3weeks.\n\nPersonally, I have been having worse, constant postnasal drip the consistency of which reminds me of silly putty, burning throat, watery eyes, coughing, tight chest and difficult to breath (like getting air, with no oxygen), and my \u201cdaily headaches\u201d are now daily migraines.  I normally get a migraine maybe once or twice a month but these have been nearly daily for the past 3 weeks.\n\nSo I went to my PCP who said  mold allergy so he sent me to an allergist (and referred me to a neurologist for the \u201cnormal\u201d abnormal daily headaches havent seen one yet). After some allergy tests (scratching and intradermal) it turns out I am not allergic to\u2026anything? Or at least anything he could test me for. ~~I had some x-rays done and am still waiting for results.~~ So, he sent me home and said to take some musinex and invest in a netipot.\n\nI\u2019m not sure how to proceed from here. I\u2019m worried that the x-ray won\u2019t turn up anything and I\u2019ll be back to square one.

I got off the car thinking the car was causing the nausea to get worse. I tried walking and I was walking so slow. I started breathing really really fast. Eventually I got this tingling sensation in my calves, toes, arms, fingers, jaw, and bottom portion of my stomach. I lost all feeling in my hands &amp;amp; feet. I was unable to speak at all, I opened my mouth and nothing came out. I was taken inside where I was given food and water. After almost 2 hours I got back. I was barely able to stand and had to almost \u201cregain\u201d the ability to walk. \n\nWe walked to the office, got there and I felt a little nauseous. I put my head down to try to make it go away then got up. Immediately my heart rate shot up and I got really nauseous. Everything was happening all over again. I had to be dragged out of the room by my gunnery sgt and rushed to the hospital. By the time I got there I had lost all ability to walk and be dragged me in once inside 2 doctors dragged me to the room thing. They did this heart test, took blood pressure, monitored my heart etc. after a few minutes it went away but it started up again. After that again it went away and I started shivering. \n\nTheir diagnosis was a heat stroke at first but it was in the morning, I regularly experienced temperatures way higher as well as humidity. We had just gotten out of a car. Then the second time it happened inside an ACed room. \n\nAfter explaining this they came up with, nausea was caused by smallpox &amp;amp; the rest was a panic attack. My issue with this diagnosis is, I\u2019ve had panic attacks before. A panic attack is psychological. You feel like you\u2019re going to die but it\u2019s all in your head but my thing was physical. I literally could not speak, move my jaw, my legs or hands. My fingers were curling up. This does not sound like a panic attack I\u2019ve ever had. \n\n????\n\nEdit: also, these symptoms always started up after my nausea got worse"

        "reddit": "Hey, first time poster, hopefully this works.\n\nMale, 33, 190lbs, 6 feet 0 inches, Caucasian.\n\nI had acne in high school and it wasn't terrible, as in it wasn't super deep and scarring, but super oily skin and surface-level pimples all over.  But my skin has always been generally terrible.  Very dry and very oily.  In high school I tried all the creams and the Amoxicillins to no avail.    In college I moved from Minnesota to Arizona.  My skin wasn't perfect, but was MUCH MUCH better in AZ.  I didn't have to worry about it as much which was great.  I thought maybe I was just growing out of it.\n\nMoved back to Minnesota at 25 and my skin has just been getting worse and worse and worse.  I've been in denial for a while.  My acne has exploded and it's gotten to the point where I really need to do something about it.  Honestly I should have done something about it at 29 or 30.  My skin is terrible.  I've, again, tried topical solution to  help and it's just not enough at all.  Being 33 and dealing with this shit is really disheartening and it's affecting my personal and professional relationships.  It's also not just on the face, it's Backne as well  I look terrible, I feel terrible, something needs to happen. \n\nSo, my doctor said I should look into Accutane.  I went to a Derm last year, he took 1 look at me and said Accutane.  I said no.  I've heard horror stories.  My girlfriend of 6 years was on it when she was younger and wishes she never took it (she believes she is now lactose intolerant because of it).  I had a teacher in high school who took it and, at least according to him, became lactose intolerant because of it.  I'm honestly scared of it. \n\nBesides my personal anecdotes, I drink a bit.  Around 3-6 drinks a night.  I have bad anxiety and probably a milder form of depression (runs in the family, but I am not medicated for it).  I really enjoy my drinks to relax at the end of the day, and I'm not sure I can do without them.  This has also caused me to be weary of starting an Accutane regiment.\n\nAnyways, after first hearing about, and thinking about, Accutane about a year ago, I went back to my Doctor.  Not to solve my acne, per se, but to address some other skin problems that keep getting worse, especially around moles, that I wanted to check out.  His response was, in essence, that my skin was still really bad, the moles were fine,  and if I wanted to solve this issue I needed to revisit the idea of Accutane.  He thinks it works, it solves problems, and there's no definitive proof that it causes any long term side effects.  He understood my weariness but provided the following arguments:\n\n1.  Accutane works.  It works well. \n2.  Your skin is really bad.  You don't have to do anything, but if you want to solve this issue, you should really consider it\n3.  Your drinking probably isn't as bad as you think it is.  The Dermatologist will monitor your liver.  You can still have drinks while on Accutane, but you should obviously consider cutting back.  They will tell you when to stop Accutane if it gets too bad. \n4. It's obviously affecting you, and it's not a fun thing to deal with.  Don't let being a hypochondriac stop you from improving your life.  \n\nSo here I am.  I'm finally at a place where I'm considering Accutane.  I have an appointment on Thursday with a Derm, so obviously that will be where most of my answers come from.  But I'm still nervous about many things.     I'm nervous about the GI shit I keep reading about all over the internet.  I'm nervous about how many cycles I may need to take.  I'm nervous about how much I drink while on it.  I'm nervous that if I bite the bullet and go on it, it won't actually work for me and I'll be exactly where I am today, but a year from now and with lactose intolerance. \n\n\nIs there anything I missed here that I should be considering?  Is my doctor a bit more optimistic than he should be?"

It's different from when your arm falls asleep-- less like static and more painful and prick-like. Prior to this, I had developed a rash on my hand. It was red with little clear bumps, not filled with fluid as far as I could tell. To me, it resembled most a more severe case of eczema. The rash was partially on some fingertips, but mainly it was on the area between my index finger and thumb. I assumed it was allergies since it's summer and I've been outside more, but it's still odd as I take my allergy medication regularly. All I did for it was put on some ointment and continue taking my allergy medication. After the prickly sensations started I began to get more concerned. That was a few days ago and it has eased up quite a bit. The rash is all but gone (the reason I don't have any pictures, sorry) and the prickly feeling doesn't happen as often and when it does it's not as intense. A new development that I noticed today was that my fingertips are prune-like. It varies in how prevalent it is, but is present at some level all the time. My fingertips also appear shiny, almost plastic-like. I still think it is most likely an allergy, but the prickly sensation has me worried. The only thing I know that to be a symptom for is diabetes, and, with already having one autoimmune disorder already, I imagine it's not as far off of a possibility as it would be for most 22 year olds. As a note: none of the medicines are new, I've been taking them for years; I haven't changed anything in my diet or anything I apply topically either. Honestly, I'm less concerned about the rash itself-- I have Crohn's and it's not particularly unusual for me to develop rashes from time to time-- and more so concerned about how it may be relevant to the other symptoms, which I am indeed concerned about. \n\nIs there reason to believe this is more than just a rash or allergic reaction? Should I continue treating it as if it is a rash or allergy (despite the now lack of a rash...), or is it time to go to a doctor and test for other things? Yet, the symptoms don't feel extreme enough to do so?"

It sounded and felt like a rumbling stomach (low croaking sound), like when you're hungry, but in my chest. After that, I started noticing it pretty much all the time after drinking (though it may have happened before that and I just didn't notice it). Even when I tried drinking very slowly and taking tiny sips, I would still feel a little something in my chest. If I had to guess what it is, it feels like gas is coming up from my stomach while the liquid is going into my stomach. From what I've noticed, I don't have this issue right away when eating something solid, only when drinking. I do, however, especially the last couple of days, have croaking sounds/sensations some time after eating as well (actually pretty much all throughout the day), just not immediately. Usually I just feel it in my chest, but sometimes in my throat as well. This usually happens after I feel a need to burp for a couple of seconds. However, I actually burp only a few times a day, and the rest of the time (if anything) I only get croaking sounds in my chest and/or throat, and sometimes bubbling/gurgling. Often when this sensation occurs, my ears also close momentarily (because of pressure perhaps?).\n\nIt started with just the croaking sounds after drinking a couple of weeks ago without any further complaints, but for the past 2-3 weeks I've also constantly felt the need to burp as described above. This feeling often goes away when my body is in the same position for a while, but as soon as I move (get up, sit down or lie down after a while of not doing so; especially when standing up) I get the urge again several times. This also happens as soon as I get out of bed in the morning. Maybe it's also relevant that the past few days I've gotten about 1-2 random single hiccups per day.\n\nI was told online that it's probably because I'm swallowing air, but I don't notice myself doing that at all. I'm not saying that it couldn't be the reason, but I have tried to eat and drink very slowly a couple of times to avoid swallowing air and it doesn't seem to make a difference. Also, I thought that it might be acid reflux that's causing this, so I tried taking a Rennie Antacid a couple of times but it also doesn't really do anything it seems.\n\nI kind of want to make an appointment with my GP, but I feel weird going for such a small thing (especially because they will most likely brush it off because they know I have anxiety issues, perhaps rightfully so?). It's starting to get really annoying and kind of embarrassing in public because of the loud croaking sounds and the constant feeling that something needs to come up though. Should I go to the doctor or just wait a little longer and see if it goes away? Or is there something else I could try to stop this? What do you think could be causing this? Am I really swallowing air all the time and just not realizing it?"

I didn't really know the cause of these issues until today, and I would like to disclaimer aside from how I'm currently feeling I have no idea if this could be the real reason. However, today as I was riding the train on my way to run errands after feeling exhausted even though I had just woke up from a 13 hour sleep, I took my glasses off. They were smudged and kind of dirty from being out in the rain and werent helping me see at that point, and almost instantly my mood had changed, my brain fog had gone away, and i began to feel very energetic and very alert. Something I haven't felt in the last 4 years. I felt like myself at this point. its now been about 15 hours and I am still feeling just as good.

I finished high school and went to university, where I managed relatively well.\n\nI attended a very intense art school where sleep deprivation was just part of the package. I pulled all-nighters quite often and it didn't really have a great effect on my health, obviously. Everyone else was in the same boat as me however, and seemed to handle it better. I remember constantly falling asleep in class, both my studio classes and lectures, no matter how awake I felt, or how hard I tried to fight it. I remember at one point thinking \"if I'm standing up, I can't fall asleep!\" wrong. This is also when I discovered that yes, you CAN fall asleep while standing up, or walking, or moving with your two feet on the ground. My knees would just buckle out from underneath me and I'd wake up on the way down, before I ever hit the floor, just stumbling around. \n\nThis was definitely the worst during my first year of college. This was the year with the longest studio classes and the worst sleep deprivation. This is also the year that I sorted out my celiac issues and regained a bit of energy. \n\nHowever, the issues were not fully solved. I dreaded going to seminar and lecture courses because when I was sitting, not doing anything but listening, I would inevitably fall asleep, there's nothing that I could do about it, I couldn't help it. It became an unpleasant 3 hours that I would literally just have to focus on NOT falling asleep.\n\nThose were my classes, in terms of leisure and movies, I couldn't stay awake, it just wouldn't happen.\n\nI never thought that I could have anything like narcolepsy because I wasn't falling asleep while I was driving... except I did have one episode where I did doze off while driving late at night last winter, which was really scary but I just assumed that it was because I was particularly tired.\n\nSome days, I'll just be exhausted. It doesn't make sense to me because I eat healthily and exercise, both items initially cured my chronic fatigue syndrome as well. Other days I'll be highly energized and then suddenly drained. Food definitely has an affect on my energy levels in terms of being careful about gluten, but even when I religiously ensure that my food is totally free of the substance, I still suffer from the issues mentioned to other degrees. \n\nI also suffer from sleep paralysis. I've had it far more times than I can count. It doesn't happen that often but it does enough. It's interesting because I've been dealing with it for years, and it has only now just received media recognition through youtube storytimes. My friends say that it's only happened to them once in their life, or never. \n\nI also have extremely vivid dreams, slight hallucinations when I'm fighting to stay awake but fail to, and I've been talking a LOT in my sleep lately. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn terms of my ADHD, I was also diagnosed this year. It explains a lot of issues, I definitely have trouble focusing or sticking to a task, I always have. I thought that this might be a contributing factor for my exhaustion because my mind is always jumping from one idea to another. I have since been prescribed Adderall, which gives me my clarity and focus back. I also don't fall asleep (well, funny, sometimes I can actually sleep after taking it). I'm interested in this because Adderall is also something that is prescribed for narcolepsy. Is it possible to have that as well as ADHD combined? \n\nI know that I can't receive a real diagnosis here, but I'm just interested to hear what you think based on the issues that I've listed. It does seem like Mono, Celiac, ADHD, history of Chronic Fatigue, and sleep paralysis could all have some sort of common thread."

I felt intense flank pain around my left kidney and a slight pressure around my right kidney.  I also had blood in my urine, and I felt a burning sensation while I urinated.  I didn't however have a fever or chills. Doctor prescribed oral antibiotics that I was to take for 10 days. The symptoms supsided, and after the full course of antibiotics the urine test came back negative for blood, protein, nitrites, white blood cells and bacteria.  I also urinate without any discomfort, and I don't have a fever, chills or nausea .  The problem is I still feel a  light dull ache around both of my kidneys and i have no appetite. I feel generaly weak as well. The pain isn't constant, it comes and goes. It's not nearly as strong as the pain i felt before I started taking antibiotics but it is making me very anxious.\n\n Is this normal? Will the pain supside if I wait it out?"

Its a wooshing sound in time with my heart beat and gets worse if i exercise or if i put my head below my heart. If i push on my neck near my artery it stops (obviously). \n\nIts driving me crazy. It really freaks me out because sometimes it gets really loud and strong sounding. It makes it really hard to concentrate sometimes and it triggers my anxiety. When it triggers my anxiety I start getting scared that im going to have an aneurysm or a heart attack. I realize these are probably irrational fears but they really freak me out. So should I be worried? Is this ever going to go away? Is there anyway to treat it because its driving me nuts. Am i going to have an aneurysm or heart attack?\n\nIn the past week i have also been having occasional flutter feelings in my chest. And like a tight feeling. I feel like it might be anxiety because college starts back up again next week (i have an anxiety disorder though it usually maifests as panic attacks  which dont include chest symptoms for me - just hyperventilating and feelings of doom. My last panic attack was probably 6 months ago) . I had chest pain last semester and saw the PA on campus who concluded my backpack was too heavy and it was causing the pain. I went paperless and minimal and my backpack weighs like nothing now and that pain went away. But now with this flutter thing I kind of want to go to the doctor about the flutters but my anxiety and depression is making it really dificult to go do that and I keep putting it off. And now the flutter feeling triggers my anxiety about aneurysms and heart attacks too. \n\nGeneral health stuff. Im female. 29. Ongoing medical issues are I have anxiety, depression, reoccuring migraines (sometimes with auras) chronic moderate pain in my right hip and eczema. And im still having some pain in my foot from am injuy a few months ago where I fell (over literally nothing because im a dork) and bruised it really bad. Im not on any meds. I was in the army for 7 years. 3 of which i was attached to artillery units (loud). Im overweight but not morbidly so. I havent seen a doc in over 3 years aside from thay visit to the campus PA.

Excruciating abdominal pain after eating greasy foods, sometimes leading to throwing up, diarrhea, etc. I ended up getting an ultrasound in September of 2018. The doctor said my gallbladder was full of sludge and needed to be removed. 3 weeks later, I underwent laparoscopic surgery and left without complications - at first. I had 4 incision sites, all of which flared up in an allergic reaction. I went to the surgeon and he stated that I have a sensitivity to dissolvable sutures, and it will take much longer for the incisions to fully heal. He said to apply hydro-cortisone as need to alleviate the itching, but that was it.\n\nMid-November 2018, I came down with a sinus infection/ear infection. Doctor gave me 10 days of antibiotics and oral steroids. Felt better after about two weeks.\n\nFirst week of January, 2019, Sinus infection again. I didn't have a chance to go to the doctor for this one. I just slept for 3 days, felt better after about 10 days.\n\n2nd week of February, very sore throat, productive cough. Doctor says it is bronchitis, 10 days of antibiotics given. Felt better after 2nd week of illness.\n\nMarch, sinus infection. Doctor says may be viral, no medicine given.\n\nApril, sore throat, swelling of tonsils. Doctor does rapid strep test, comes back positive, strep throat. Antibiotics again.\n\nMay, ear infection, drops prescribed.\n\nJune, I made it 1 month without getting sick!\n\nJuly, I started coughing a non-productive cough on a Friday. It was irritating but otherwise I felt fine. Persisted through the whole weekend. Monday morning, woke up feeling like I had the flu. Check my temperature, it was 99.9. I brought a thermometer with me to work. By 10am, the fever was 101. I went home, took some Motrin and went to sleep for about 12 hours. The next morning my fever was 102.1. The cough was horrible, but only mildly productive when I first woke up. I made an appointment at my doctor for that afternoon. By the time I arrived, they marked my temperature at 103.6. They gave me Motrin, ice packs, a nebulizer for the cough, and sent me for a chest x-ray. The x-ray showed that I had pneumonia present in the upper right lob of my lung. I was given antibiotics and oral steroids.\n\nI made a follow-up appointment with my primary doctor on August 1st, after I felt like I was getting worse and falling back into the illness again. The doctor said my ear was very red, the cough was very rumbly in my chest still, but the followup x-ray showed the pneumonia had cleared. He gave me 7 more days of antibiotics and a Symbicort inhaler to use daily for 30 days (2 puffs in the morning, 2 puffs at night).\n\nI then went for a full blood and urine panel. All results came back within range, with the exception of my cholesterol, which was slightly above range, but not \u201cof concern\u201d. My white blood cell count was at the very top of the range, but he said that could be because of the antibiotics.\n\nIt has been 2 weeks and my cough is still present. By mid afternoon daily, I have no voice. The more I talk, the more I cough. It still has a rumble in my chest.\n\nNow my complaint. I have expressed to every doctor that I have never been this sick in my entire life, and it all started after having my gallbladder removed. The moment I mention this, every doctor says \u201chmm\u201d and that\u2019s it. The fact that almost 1 year after my surgery I STILL have the incision sites randomly swell and become incredibly itchy are of no concern to any doctor I\u2019ve seen. And the fact that I have been sick monthly, culminating in pneumonia (which I\u2019ve never had before) that has my voice destroyed and coughing for over 5 weeks now, being chalked up to a \u201cstring of bad luck\u201d (primary doctor). He also asked if I had any pets. I have had 2 ferrets for 5 years.  He said that could be why, even though I expressed that this recurring illness hasn\u2019t been an issue until November of 2018.  He suggested seeing an allergist, again referencing my ferrets. The allergist has since called me a dozen times trying to set up an appointment. It seems like high-pressure sales rather than a relevant medical suggestion.\n\nI want to go back to the doctor as this cough is still so persistent, but I don\u2019t know where to turn."

But I still wonder why this is happening. Even if I drink only a single beer in the evening I will be a complete mess the day after. Anxious, several panic attacks, extremely tired to the point all I can do is lie down, dizzy and cold sweats. I do have anxiety and some panic attacks 'normally'. I have never been a heavy drinker but I could easily drink a bottle of wine or 5-6 beers in my 20s and only be moderately hungover. Should I be worried there is something else wrong that causes this extreme reaction to a tiny amount of alcohol?"

At random my neck feels like it is being pulled back and to the right by my muscles and sometimes it\u2019s so extreme that my neck leans. It started out bearable because I still had a decently strong body. I could still do things as long as I wasn\u2019t overexerting myself. I would randomly get these spells and would have to lay down and let it pass or go to the hospital if it was really bad. I\u2019ve seen my family doctor for it plenty of times and all he gave me was muscle relaxers. I have seen a neurologist and he did an EMG and other nerve conduction studies that all came back normal. I have gotten an MRI on my brain and have had one in the past of my neck which were normal as well. I was doing physiotherapy but it wasn\u2019t helping and felt like trial and error. \n\nFast-forwarding to now, I am bed ridden and barely have enough energy to take a shower.

I\u2019ve done as much as I could to try to get to the bottom of it. The only possible cause of my shoulder issue was the day it started, I was trying to remove a rusted spray nozzle from the hose.

        "reddit": "Hi, I've been trying to eliminate possible reasons I've suffered from anxiety and depression my entire adult life. I just recently realized many of the symptoms I feel are incredibly similar to that of men with low testosterone. I did a little bit of research to learn more; however, my knowledge and perspective is extremely limited as I'm obviously not a doctor. I was hoping I could have some help interpreting my free/total testosterone levels with SHBG. I'd take these to my own doctor, but I don't have health insurance at the moment. I'm trying to be as proactive as possible without spending too much money.\n\n[Here's the link to my results.](https://66.media.tumblr.com/393629576b4f0e0df7ee97ca0ed525fb/tumblr_pw8lbrwAwX1r9mft2o1_1280.jpg)\n\nI'll try to give as much information as possible.\n\nI'm a 29 year old, caucasian male. Height: 5'8\" Weight: 145 lbs. I've been diagnosed with anxiety and depression since I was, at least, 18 years old. The anxiety, in particular, was pretty debilitating. I had weird, uncontrollable body spasms in random social situations and tension in neck. Those were the worst symptoms and the reason I turned to substances to cope (alcohol and Xanax). I haven't used those since I was 26 now, and, with plenty of therapy, my anxiety and depression have been much more manageable within the years since.\n\nI've taken, what seems to be, every antidepressant under the sun, but most recently and for the longest, I was taking Wellbutrin 300mg. I recently weaned off, and I've not felt any different since. In fact, the only noticeable difference I've felt was a positive one: a clearer mind, not bogged down with intrusive thoughts. I understand this could be a coincidence, but I figure the information might be of some importance. As of right now, I take Omeprazole 20mg (for heartburn), a multi-vitamin, and vitamin D daily. I also take Doxycycline hyclate 100mg twice a day for some body acne, as of just recent. I eat pretty healthy for a single 29 year old guy and exercise pretty regularly.\n\nIn January, back when I had insurance, back when it didn't occur to me to use a sort-of process of elimination to be more proactive in dealing with these symptoms, I went to my doctor for my annual check-up. My blood panels came back all within normal range; however, my testosterone levels were not tested.\n\nSymptoms include (but are not limited to):\n\n* Little-to-no sex drive\n* Fatigue, lethargy, absolutely no energy\n* Apparent (to me) but not drastic mood changes\n* Horrible memory\n* Hard to focus\n* Depression\n* Social and general anxiety\n\n**Tl;dr: My symptoms are similar to those of men with low testosterone. I had my levels tested yesterday and would like help interpreting them.**\n\nWhat are your thoughts? How would you proceed if I were your patient? What should my next steps be? Suggestions?\n\nPlease let me know if you need additional information. Thank you!"

She is currently 86 and other than taking multiple blood pressure meds for hypertension and some cholesterol meds she is relatively healthy and sharp for her age. In the last month or two we are noticing she may be forgetting to take her meds on occasion. We believe this led to her not eating and drinking enough which only made things worse and when her son came over to visit her he noticed she was insanely confused and seemed to have swollen ankles etc and thought it was the year 2008. We called 911 and found she hadn't been taking her meds or staying hydrated and this led to the development of pneumonia. \n\nWell, she was released from the hospital last week and my gf has been staying with her full time since to ensure she is eating, drinking and taking all her meds on time. On top of this every morning she checks her vitals such as BP and 02 saturation. I mention this to set the stage that for the last week all her meds have been taken and she is very well looked after. This is when things took a turn. She allowed her daughter in law to borrow her car due to the fact she can't drive right now and today asked where her car had gone? We simply explained she offered her car to her in daughter in law to use for the week. She then claimed she never did that and she shouldn't just abuse the fact she has a nicer car and take it from her for long periods of time. We then explained we were there and witnessed her offer it. After about 1 min she asked again, where is my car at?? This happened well over 10 times in the course of an hour and she would even on occasion think her niece took it, even though her niece hasn't been in the USA for a long time.\n\nThis led to her saying she doesn't even get to see her son and he never visits. He was there the day prior which we reminded her of. She denied it. Then went on to repeat this over and over again and we explained the situation each time to her. We then stepped out to go grab essentials for dinner just to come back 25min later and see her eating cereal out of a pot used for cooking food even though she has very nice plates and bowls and has never done such a thing before in her life.\n\nThis morning she seems a little more lucid but has asked where people are multiple times even after we explained where they had gone or why they aren't over. \n\nI'm sorry it's so long winded but she is usually fairly out together and we'll educated and articulate and it seems she is losing her ability to hold on to short term memory.

I say strange because it was only fever (38.4 C) without other symptoms, except for joint pains. I didn't really care about it because it disappeared the next day.\nThan, 1 month after that I woke up at night with severe back pain and fever, ~38.5 C. The fever again disappeared the next day, but I had sore throat from then on for a week. I started to worry a bit, so 1-2 weeks after I experienced this 2nd fever episode I went to a reumatologist (because of the back pain, which I've had for a few years now, but I never felt it so bad). He concluded based on the physical examination that my pain is not inflammatory. I also had a sacroiliac MRI, which was negative in terms of sacroileitis. He ordered a blood test. When they did the blood test I had some respiratory infection. Lab results came back: 12 CRP, normal ESR, 620 lymphocytes. He ordered chest xray and abdominal ultrasound. Both negative. He ordered another blood test 3 days after the first for virology and immunology and a whole lot other things. CRP was 35, esr 18, lymphocytes 1150, so still a bit low. I went to a hematologist, he looked at all my data, examined me and said he almost completely sure it's not lymphoma (which I was afraid of). He said let's see if I get better (i had low grade (37.1, 37.2 C) fever for 2 weeks than). I got better, my lab test was perfect, normal crp normal esr, normal blood count... But i was still worried because sometimes I felt like my tempereture went up during the day. As i checked when I felt feverish I had 36.9 C, which nobody takes seriously. I had a contrast enhanced CT of my neck, chest and abdomen and it was negative. After that my hematologist said I should forget about lymphoma and live my life. He said that because I called him a lot and was really worried. Now everyone says it's an anxiety disorder. But I'm worried because I don't feel healthy. I still have back pain and dull bone pains here and there. Now I'm worried I have leukemia. But nobody takes me seriously now. I want to do as my hematologist said: \"forget about the disease\", but I feel like the disease doesn't want me to forget about it. How could anxiety cause temperature swings and bone pain?

They may be connected. The problem from the last year or so first. \n\nLast year I was feeling really lonely and it physically hurt in my chest. I came back from a very stressful trip to Europe in April. About 2 weeks after my chest hurt again, but it felt like anxiety, but really bad. A lot of chest pressure and dull ache. It lasted for weeks. I assumed it was an autistic burnout to the extreme. \n\nMy psychiatrist wanted me to get an EKG so I did a few weeks ago. My PCP said it was fine. I saw the psych today and she said it's not fine. There's an old anterior infarct and negative inverted t signals. I think it is in 1 and 3. I read both of those things can be normal individually, but I haven't found anything with them together so I'd just like an explanation, please. \n\nBecause of this I went back and looked at the other results the Dr said was fine. \n\nMy rheumatoid factors are &lt;10.  This may be important. \n\nSo my Dr had the tests done because he thought I had fybromialgia. I looked it up and it was kind of hit or miss. I read up on lupus and if I include the chest pain I have every symptom except maybe the butterfly rash. My cheeks do get red and they get some bumps that never get a head. However, if I use zit cream they go away. If I don't, they never go away. It's just the redness doesn't really look like the picks of the butterfly rash. It's fairly light right now otherwise I'd put a pic.\n\nAnyway, I looked at the blood work and my PLT is over 448. It says it shouldn't be above 353. \n\nMy RBC and RBW are both low, but not super low. I think the RBC is still normal for women and they just show the men's range in the results so it read low.

Ongoing issue as of 8/10/2019, full body pain, but centralized in neck-head region.  Diagnosed issues include: ADHD, mid to severe recurring depression, generalized anxiety, type 2 diabetes, iron deficient anemia.  Medications: 500mg metformin, 3x/day. Cymbalta 60mg, 1x/day. I have an IUD, I also take over the counter supplements like iron and melatonin on an as-needed basis. Infrequent marijuana user (3x/month). Non-smoker, but did vape about 3-4 years ago, nearly daily. \n\nI also want to add that by doing what I\u2019ve done and going about this was/is MASSIVELY STUPID and anyone who is thinking about going off their meds, always talk with your doctor so you\u2019re not put in a bad spot like me. Honestly, I\u2019m kicking myself for not being smarter than this!\n\n\nTo start, I will say that I was diagnosed with depression as young as 7 years old but only ever spoke with therapists as a child. About a year and a half ago I was blindsided by the sickness of a close relative and was recommended by my OBGYN to go on Effexor. (Dosage was 60mg 1x/day). I switched over to Cymbalta this past May because I believed my body was overly dependent on the medication to the point that ever single dose age would need to be at the same time. Any sooner or later than the 24hr mark, I would experience awful withdrawal symptoms up to and including flu-like symptoms, aggressive amounts of sweating, brain zaps/ shudders, nightmares, short-lived narcolepsy, worsening depression, suicidal thoughts, and confusion.  This past May, I switched over to Cymbalta and was blessed with MUCH milder withdrawal symptoms if I were to forget my med for a day or two. The symptoms were confusion, mood swings, brain shudders, and short periods of abnormal sweating but where all very mild compared to Effexor.\n\n\nDue to the fact that I\u2019m on part time and recently lost insurance coverage via my parents (aged out of Tri-Care Prime if that paints any better of a picture for anyone) I\u2019ve run out of those medications. My insurance will be instated via my job with the next 30 days, which I don\u2019t have medicine coverage for. My previous PCM refuses to give me a bridge since I\u2019m out of their system (gotta love the military). I don\u2019t blame anyone for this but myself. \n\n\nI read and just about everywhere, everyone says that you shouldn\u2019t stop this class of medication without a doctor\u2019s help/ supervision. But I\u2019ve run out of medication as of August 10th, so I had no choice. So far the journey hasn\u2019t been so bad. I have bouts of sweating or chills, I have wild dreams, and my sleep is just about everywhere. I do use marijuana to soften the blow if I can\u2019t handle the brain shutters/zaps. I found some tablets of Effexor, but I\u2019m too nervous because I\u2019m already towing the line by going cold turkey.\n\nIs there a way to detox my body out of withdrawals or am I way over my head? Would drinking tea, edibles, and working out like I\u2019ve been doing help or am I off base?"

When I was 26 I awoke one morning after a heavy night of drinking to a bout of painful burning diarrhea. I thought it was from the drinking but it never went away. I went to my GP and was told I had Hpilor and gastritis. was prescribed an antibiotic and a PPI and sent on my way. six months later I still had the diarrhea and was referred to a gastro. an endoscopy and colonoscopy were performed which said everything looked good but I had a small Hiatal hernia. I was told to continue on my PPI and make changes to my diet to include more fiber. Fast forward 2 years. I awoke to right side rib pain and every time I ate I vomited up frothy Mucos. I was sent for an ultrasound and had small gallstones. My gastro convinced me they were the culprit and ordered my gallbladder removed. around this time I started having premature atrial contractions.  This made my IBS-D go Nuclear.  I was put on cohlostramine told to not eat fried foods and sent on my way. fast forward to 35. I awoke one morning to go on vacation and I started having severe chest pains.  was put on an EKG and assured I was not, in fact, having a heart attack prescribed Stronger PPI's and sent on my way. The chest pains continued I was given another endoscopy and another colonoscopy. I was informed that my hernia had grown slightly and I now had fresh scarring on my esophagus. A Ph bravo test was ordered and I wore a monitor for several days it reported back sever instances of acid reflux. About three months later I found myself in the ER with severe lower left rib pain I was diagnosed with pancreatitis was told there was nothing they could really do and was instructed to not drink and drink plenty of water and follow up with my GP or gastro the problem slowly went away and that thank god never happened again. It was at this point that I started having severe muscle and joint pain along with my neurological symptoms. I started having a week long PAC episodes and went to see a cardiologist. after wearing a monitor it was determined I needed a nuclear stress test. the Stress test came back abnormal and a heart cath was ordered. the Cardiologist said after the cath my heart was clear and looked extremely healthy with no buildup or abnormalities. At this point, I was so fed up with medicine I gave up and just tried to ignore it all. my PAC's sucked but weren't going to kill me and the Dihreah was manageable altho I had several incidents of soiling myself and it was embarrassing on occasion. I changed my diet completely gave up sugar, caffeine, and fried foods and began taking vitamins and probiotics.  things got better for about half a year until I started waking up with severe muscle cramps dizzy spells and others on the list and also having to pee throughout the night now. I also stopped taking my PPI's because every time I took them I felt horrible so I eat TUMS like candy. the neurological problems on top of the stomach problems on top of the PAC's was a fresh new hell. This year I decided to go back to my GP and try one more time to see if they could figure out what was wrong with me.  MY GP ordered a huge blood panel believing it was some sort of vitamin deficiency or metabolic issue or some type of arthritis. He also told me to stop eating dairy for a month and see if my symptoms improved. The blood work all came back fine no issues so he sent me to see a Neurologist. he ordered a test for Lymes disease and an MRI of my brain to make sure I didn't have a tumor or lesion. Both tests came back negative and he has now referred me to a Rheumatologist.  I have an appointment with a new gastro to get my hernia fixed it's at least one thing I can deal with somewhat easily. I know this is a lot and everything might not be related but I've been dealing with all this for more than a decade and I just wanted someones opinion on what the hell it might be. I've been poked prodded and had more cameras up my ass than the paparazzi I'm just looking for answers.  Thanks for any help."

At first, it seemed like a normal headache, possibly caused by too much screen time. I medicated with 500 mg of acetaminophen, then later took another 500 mg tablet when the first one didn't seem effective. It eased up, and I hung out with some friends, playing games and watching movies. No drinking, smoking, or otherwise headache-inducing activities.

I was so dizzy that I couldn't sleep, because whenever I closed my eyes it felt like I was spinning. I was even more nauseated than before, and vomited 3+ times within the span of about an hour and a half. I couldn't keep food or drink down. I was shaking/trembling, sweating, felt very hot, and my head felt like it was being crushed. I drove myself to the ER, where they just monitored me for maybe an hour. They didn't give me any medication because anything they wanted to give me would have made me drowsy, and I had no one to drive me home. They said they believe it to be a migraine, but couldn't say for certain since I have no history of migraines. My mother was worried,, so she made me an appointment with our family doctor, who ordered a CT scan without contrast. I'm scheduled for that tomorrow afternoon. My head still hurts, and I still get pain and dizziness with anything that raises my blood pressure or causes blood to rush to my head (work, miscellaneous physical exertion, bending over, etc.). OTC medications have not been doing much at all to touch it.\n\nDoes this sound like a migraine to any of you? I've never had one, so I don't have anything to compare to. Of course, the worst case scenarios are going through my head, such as the possibilities of a tumor, aneurysm(s), bleeding in the brain, clot, etc., but I'm trying to stay positive and not stress myself unnecessarily (because it makes my head hurt worse). Any input or insight would be much appreciated, because this is probably around day 6 of this persisting headache."

About a year ago, for no apparent reason, my right foot (only the right one, and mostly just the foot) swelled up. I had not sustained any injury and was not recovering from an illness or a surgery. When it first started, the foot was tender and I was feeling mild pain, but after a few weeks the pain subsided and I was just left with chronic swelling. I visited my primary care doctor and my uric acid levels were tested (for gout) and came back normal. She then told me that swelling of the feet and ankles just happens to women sometimes and that it would pass. I was skeptical but gave it some time. I tried compression , elevation, soaking, epsom salts, and icing it, and nothing helped. I then saw another general practitioner who was stumped and couldn\u2019t diagnose anything, so I saw a foot and ankle specialist who took x-rays, tried blood pressure meds, then diuretics. Those don\u2019t  help either. It\u2019s been over a year now and the foot is still swollen every single day. Just the one right foot, and it does not extend up the leg. There is no discoloration or abnormalities in temperature. I have no other obvious symptoms except that recently I\u2019ve noticed that the skin feels dry and sometimes itchy. I had read about Lymphedema when the swelling initially started, but it didn\u2019t quite seem to fit. Now I\u2019m rethinking this due to the slight changes in the skin. But I don\u2019t know where to go from here. From what I\u2019ve read, Lymphedema isn\u2019t easy to diagnose and there isn\u2019t much of a treatment for it anyhow.

In high school my grades were not very good and I always sort of struggled. I always just thought maybe I was one of the stupid kids and that I will never go to college or university. Anyways...after high school I always had luck getting labour jobs... construction jobs and warehousing jobs ever since I barely graduated high school.\n\nAnyways throughout the last 7 years I've noticed that I struggle at work some times. Things like memory, processing information are difficult for me. Some days are better than others. I don't have a hearing problem but I feel like I might have some sort of auditory processing disorder. Loud environments are difficult for me to have conversations with people in and listening to a bosses instructions in a loud environment can really make things confusing which happens frequently since I work in a loud environment lol.. one really difficult embarrassing problem I have is sleeping through my alarm clock always and my dad has to come in my room and wake me up. It's like my brain chooses to ignore to alarm.. One more big issue is not being able to recall words I want to say when I'm having a conversation with someone. It's like that tip of the tongue feeling where you are trying to remember a specific word or name. This results in me being pretty quiet and anti social.\n\nI always felt like 95% of people are smarter than me, learn faster than me and that I'm fucked up lol. Anyways.. I've been googling my symptoms here and there for the last year... always finding diseases or disorders that possibly fit my situation... But until recently I REALLY FOUND IT. I honestly found what is truly my major malfunction lol. \n\n Typical brain-based, primary disabilities of FASD include: \n\n* inconsistent memory and recall\n* inability to filter out environmental or emotional distractions and sensory stimuli\n* slow and inconsistent cognitive and auditory processing\n* decreased mental stamina\n* difficulty interpreting and applying abstract concepts (for example, managing money and time)\n* impulsivity and poor judgment\n* inability to predict outcomes (of their own or others' actions)\n* difficulty shifting from one context to another\n* resistant to change\n\nOk so yes I think I may be on the fetal alcohol spectrum. I hate saying. I really feel normal overall but this is the black pill of my life. It really sucks to think that I will never be normal and I will always have to work hard labor jobs my whole life because my brain is slightly damaged since birth. I feel like I wont ever be able to take on a job that requires real responsibility and technicality. Math is way to difficult for me to learn so I will never be able to go to college to learn a trade. Some times menial tasks can feel overwhelming to me and cause me anxiety. The one major symptom about FASD that I feel doesn't fit me is poor judgement and getting in trouble with the law because I've never been arrested or gone to jail. \n\nNO ONE IN MY LIFE KNOWS ABOUT THIS PROBLEM OF MINE.\n\nOk this is honestly a big vent. I just don't know how to get help with this problem. I feel like even if a went to a doctor the is nothing they could do. Also as a final note, yes my mother is an alcoholic and she has kids that i highly suspect have FAS."

I also get a random rush of anxiety. I\u2019m thinking it could be a parasite since my cat recently had worms. I really hope not. I\u2019ve took ibuprofen one night and Benadryl the next, nothing works really. I have no insurance too so idk if I can see a doctor which is terrifying to me. I also stopped smoking weed after months of doing it multiple times a week so idk if that could play a part. Answers will be greatly appreciated, I\u2019m tired of feeling like this.

I passed out from the heat at the end of my work day and when I woke up I was in an urgent care clinic which is 5 minutes from my work place. The nurse that was there when I can to, told me that my colleagues had bought me in and that I was mildly dehydrated. She said that I didn't need an IV and that I just need to drink more fluids and eat properly ( I told her I hadn't eaten much that day.) Before leaving I asked her for a flu shot since I had meant to get one and thought this was a good opportunity. She brought the injection and I was done in 2 minutes. But I noticed that the nurse was very distracted and was constantly yelling over her shoulder to someone asking her something and seemed to not be paying attention, she even at one point said to herself \"what was i doing?\"\n\nMy question is simple for which i couldn't find an answer on google. Are there any signs to know if I have been injected by a used needle? I am having no reaction on the injection site or any other but I want to ask the medical professionals that if one was injected with a used needle, would there be any physical signs?\n\nPlease if someone can answer this clearly, I would appreciate it so much. On google it seems you can be injected and wouldn't know unless you do a blood test which seems exaggerated, are there no physical symptoms/signs that occur if you're inject with a used needle??"

If you take your hand and put in on your hips; where your fingers touch your stomach - that is where the pain is centrally located. It started 8 years ago with seemingly no warning and no signs. I thought it correlated to either me being hungry, or needing to go to the bathroom. It also occurred with me being on my feet often enough. Eventually I went to several gastroenterologists; internal medicine doctors; and even a \"science based doctor\" who tried to sell me on the idea of 'leaky gut'. I've had endoscopies; colonoscopies; CT scans; MRIs; and ultrasounds. I've also had consistent, full blood panels performed. Every single one of those tests has come back normal. The CT scan only showed a slight \"fatty liver\" but nothing of concern. I was told it was \"IBS\" - since I also have random bouts of diarrhea. I don't have any food triggers, and I've tried the FODMAP. \n\nFor about a year or two, the pain subsided and I never really noticed it. However in 2018 it started coming back in full force. It's actually fairly debilitating and prevents me from doing any \"activity\" that's strenuous (running; hiking; even shoveling). Doctor's don't have any answers and just default to IBS - which in my eyes, is a catch all for stomach issues that they can't diagnoses. I've been tested for SIliacs; Crohn's; and a few other gastro disorders. Each one came back negative. \n\nRecently, I've noticed the pain more,  shortly before I have to go the bathroom. However when the pain comes it will last anywhere from 10 minutes to a half hour. I'll also noticed it after I eat on occasion. I also feel bloated more often than not; which incidentally makes me feel \"fatter\" than I am. I have a small gut that I would like to get rid of, but any kind of physical activity makes this pain flare up. \n\nWhat in the world is going on and why is \"IBS\" a diagnosis for this? There is obviously some kind of stimulus causing this pain. What can I do to make it go away?"

I was diagnosed with Chlamydia in October of last year. I was treated and retested and that was taken care of. Now yesterday I went to the doctor for what i thought was a ruptured cyst. My doctor thinks I may have herpes though. I wont get the results until probably Friday. I dont have a super long list of partners (not that that really matters) only 5 people and 1 I was with for 6 years. I am dying to know where I got these but I know that's irrelevant and I probably will never know. The thing is I cant believe I may have had them both at the same time and literally NO symptoms (well until this incident that brought me to the dr). I only found out of the Chlamydia during a routine woman visit. Has anyone else heard of having multiple STDs with no symptoms? Please don't be mean I was already dealing with depression and adding this on top is really hard I feel like shit. Im hoping this is some other type of ulcer because I am super prone to oral canker sores. And thank you in advance for any input!\n\nI should add that the guy I'm currently with I've been with for a year. And hes been tested he says and has always been good. And previous to him was my sons dad who I was with for 6 years. We did split for awhile and I met a guy I hooked up with twice probably 4 years ago. So I'm thinking I've had these for awhile if this comes back positive"

I go to the gym regularly each week and average about 1.5 hours of training each session.

I have been training since I was 18 primarily with weights but I also do a little bit of cardio and martial arts here and there.\n\nSome examples of what cardio problems I have problems with:\n\n* I cant even jog for 1 mile non stop\n* After 5 minutes of running my heart rate is in the \"high\" zone at around 160+ bpm and feels like it will pop out my chest\n* My airways feel \"tight\" when exerting myself. It feels like my lung capacity gives up before my muscles are tired\n* My cardio is not just slightly bad more my age, its terrible - My 2.4km run time is that of a 65 year old male.\n\nBlaming my poor performance on the thallassemia or smoking is easy. But to be honest my dad is mid 50s and even with his asthma he can run laps round me. Whilst it contributes for sure, I dont think it is the cause - hence looking for a second opinion."

I have similar \"bumps\" along my chest where my ribs are (as does everyone), it's just kind of how they stick out a bit. Hers tends to stick out in one area of her chest.

Have been self medicating with cbd oil 33mg doses 1-2 times daily for past 3 weeks. Fish oil supplements as of last week.\n\nOverall I feel the anxiety has become more manageable over the past month, however the recent issue has been concerns of the heart health and if this persistent stress and anxiety is dangerous for my heart. \n\nI don\u2019t think I\u2019m in the best physical shape and I used to drink 3-4 cups of coffee a day prior to the anxiety to which I\u2019ve recently cut off coffee entirely for fear of heart complications. My concern comes especially during intense physical exertion.\n\nI\u2019ve been experiencing palpitations during sex or masturbation to the point where I\u2019m afraid to do those things. Been experiencing a lot of muscle pains Generally throughout the body but specifically my left arm has been sore (I\u2019m not masturbating that much). Also have experienced shortness of breath in recent weeks, especially in the mornings. I used to experience dizziness in the morning with no other symptoms but now it seems it\u2019s shortness of breath and no dizziness. I haven\u2019t had a whole lot of chest pain that feels inconsistent with anxiety, it\u2019s been short little \u201cpokes\u201d of pain that linger for about a minute at most. I don\u2019t ever feel chest pain during physical exertion nor the shortness of breath but have seen it more often while at rest. \n\nI want to think it\u2019s all anxiety related as I haven\u2019t had these issues before the anxiety really took over. Is it possible the palpitations during sexual activities is due to the anxiety or is it something I should follow up with a cardiologist for?\n\nSome final notes, I had some preliminary diagnosis of SVT back in 2012 that we could never get to replicate, and these scenarios never feel as bad as that used to feel (literal pounding of the heart at 200bpm after hard exercise). It eventually just stopped happening and I cant recall it happening in over 6 years. I\u2019ve always had a palpitation here and there but just feeling some extra heart concern given the recent events for me. I do have a history of heart attack in my family (my grandfather survived a heart attack in his late 60s from poor diet)\n\nLASTLY, I had an EKG done during a panic attack 8/17 with a blood pressure of 133/93, pulse around 90, sinus report came back unremarkable/normal. Referred me to a cardiologist for a consultation tomorrow but it\u2019s getting expensive with all these doctors visits I\u2019ve made. If you\u2019d like to see history of my bloodwork done back in May for a better idea of everything I have access to that as well\n\nLooking forward to any responses you may have.\n\nThank you!"

It was out of nowhere and most times when he gets upset it happens when we are doing something mundane that we usually do. He often can't even explain why he's upset he just is.

He talked almost robotically and it all seemed cold. I told him he didn't seem alright and that I was worried. He told me that if it bothered me he could either feel sad or feel happy.  After a bit, he was sad again and said that he thought about how he was acting (in reference to not feeling) and that it scared him. He then had what I think was an extremely bad panic attack, he was hyperventilating and couldn't think, and told me that he had to hit himself in the head in order to feel better. He was saying that he was done hurting people and somehow hurting himself was the only way to make it better. I tried to get him to not do it but ultimately he hit himself anyways. A moment or two later he blacked out/passed out and when he became lucid again he talked about his head hurting extremely bad and how his whole body felt tired. We ended up falling asleep but this morning it was bad again. He doesn't want to be left alone, and he seems to be getting upset every few hours then being okay for a bit. I'm just concerned because of how rapid the switch between okay and freaking out are as well as how often they happen.   \nI apologize if this is messy or doesn't make a lot of sense.

It usually happens when I stay up too late and into the next morning. I wake up with this weird coldness that lasts throughout the day but slowly goes away. I don\u2019t get severely cold, its just these random chills I get and it seems like it comes from inside. I\u2019ll also get a little sweaty as the day goes on and my skin will itch and I\u2019ll get a chill that goes through my legs arms, and back if something touches my skin. Some days it\u2019s worse than others, again it seems like it starts in the night if I stay up late. I\u2019m 90% sure this is not normal. If I wake up like this and take a hot shower, I\u2019ll feel like I\u2019m freezing and getting chills in the shower. I\u2019ll go outside, and I\u2019ll get chills and be itchy when it\u2019s 80 degrees out. It doesn\u2019t feel good at all and it\u2019s been hard to deal with. The best way to describe how I feel throughout the day is as if the day before I played a bunch of sports and then didn\u2019t shower that night. You just wake up feeling gross. I usually get goosebumps too with it. I think it happens less in the summer but that could be just cause I\u2019m getting more sleep. It almost never happens if I go to sleep at 11pm or 12am and wake up at 10am as opposed to 6:30 or 7am. But I can\u2019t go to bed early during school cause Im busy and have stuff to do. I\u2019ll feel a little cold at like 12am and I just know that tomorrow will suck. I told my mom and I went to the doctors but the doctor said I was probably just someone who got cold a lot. I really don\u2019t think so, this is horrible sometimes. I didn\u2019t give him all the facts about this though, so I might go again and try to give them all the info I can. I can\u2019t find too much online about it and idk what it could be. I found that it could be linked to my anxiety, and that\u2019s why it happens more in the fall and winter during school. Im a lot less stressed than I was last year though and these days I barely have any anxiety, so if it was linked to that it probably would have gone away by now.

Everyday I struggle to wake up because I feel so sleep deprived and unmotivated to do anything. I feel like I havent gotten good sleep in years.. It doesnt matter how long I sleep, when I sleep, I just feel shitty; just different kinds of shitty depending on how long I sleep. I wake up and immediately feel tired, sometimes with a shortness of breath and fast beating heart, fatigue and headache that lasts throughout the day.

I feel very faint at times, especially when I crouch down and then stand up (I got tested for anemia and it was not the case so..). \nAlso, I've always been a very sweaty and heat intolerant person, but lately its been insane.

Current meds are:\nVyvanse 20mg 1/day\nSertraline 200mg 2/day\nBuspirone 5mg 2/twice a day\nI was also recently on spirinolactone for hormonal acne but ran out of refills and haven\u2019t been able to get more (want to say it was 25mg 1/day)\n\nOnly surgery I\u2019ve ever had was for tubes in my ears and adenoid removal when I was like 7. There is literally no possible way I could be pregnant and I\u2019m not on any kind of birth control (and never have been). \n\nI had what I\u2019d consider pretty great vision until I was around 20/21 at which point things were blurry from far away. I\u2019ve had glasses since spring of 2017 which I don\u2019t wear at home but wear while driving, at work, and when I\u2019m out and about. My mom also got glasses at around the same age as I did. I do not wear, not have I ever worn, contacts. \n\nLast summer, my eye doctor saw some bulging in my eye and sent me to an ophthalmologist who said it could be pseudotumor (?) or just a congenital thing (it was the first time I\u2019d been seen by our family eye doctor as I had my first exam at a visionworks). I had also gained about 30lbs over the past year up to that point (and was already a little chunky before that) due to depression, laziness, and some mild binge eating (though I\u2019m on vyvanse chiefly for ADHD) and he wanted me to lose a certain percentage (can\u2019t remember exactly but I think it was about 15lbs down from when I was just above 200lbs) in a few months and come back; if it had gotten better, then it was probably pseudotumor and if it hadn\u2019t, it was probably congenital. I think I lost about 20lbs before going back (though I did postpone my appointment a month or two) and he ultimately came to the conclusion that it\u2019s just how my eyes are. That\u2019s the last time I had any kind of issue. I was honestly kind of hoping it *was* pseudotumor because I had read that a symptom is something a wooshing noise in the ears which I have been plagued by for years now (and my ENT basically said that he didn\u2019t see anything and it just happens sometimes and there\u2019s nothing that can be done and that I can listen to music to try to drown it out). \n\nFast forward to earlier this week. I randomly started noticing some flashes or shadows in my peripheral vision in my left eye. I honestly don\u2019t know how to describe it but it\u2019s definitely some kind of sudden movement but it\u2019s fleeting; it usually only lasts like 5 seconds at a time. It\u2019s not super dramatic but it\u2019s definitely noticeable. There\u2019s no pain when it happens and I\u2019ve only noticed it in my left eye. I\u2019d say it probably happens a few times an hour at most, a few times a day at least. I did have a bad headache this afternoon but that cleared up with some ibuprofen and I haven\u2019t had a headache every day this has happened. I also haven\u2019t had any other unusual symptoms. I haven\u2019t gotten any floaters, either. It just happened a few times as I\u2019ve been writing this and I guess a good way to describe it (well, maybe not *good* but an alternate way, at least) is it like ebbs and flows on the top and side of my vision. It\u2019s not a particular color or anything but it\u2019s just SOMETHING out of the ordinary. One of the things I saw going down the dreaded google rabbit hole was retinal detachment but given that this has been happening for days and I haven\u2019t had any other symptoms, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s quite that urgent. \n\nI\u2019m overdue for my annual checkup so I finally called this evening. They aren\u2019t able to get me in for the exam any time soon but said they could see me Friday morning to check out what\u2019s going on with my vision. I have pretty severe anxiety (even with the litany of related meds I take) so I\u2019m probably going to be sick about this until I go anyway, but I\u2019d love to hear if any of you have any educated guesses regarding what it might be and how concerned I should be. I know a lady who went in for a routine eye appointment and, after her doctor saw something abnormal, was sent to a specialist and within 24 hours of that was in surgery to remove a grapefruit sized brain tumor (and she was miraculously okay and different very few side effects as a result) so I of course keep thinking it\u2019s something terrible even though there\u2019s no point in worrying because it either is or isn\u2019t and there\u2019s nothing I can do about it in either case."

I'll also throw in mild tinnitus, floaters/flashers (recent eye exam was normal), brain fog that comes and goes, and bad short-term memory. Normal blood pressure.\n\n-Duration: Stabbing/short headaches have happened sporadically - several times per year - since puberty. But ever since about May of this year, it's been ramped up, maxing out at over 100 a DAY. They're not always super painful, anywhere from a 3-6 on the traditional pain scale and lasting from a split second to 10ish. Of note, this was about the same time I stopped hormonal birth control. I was on it for 6 years without side effects.\n\n-Location: head, mostly sides. I've read that ice pick headaches tend to be located near the eye and temple, and while I do get the occasional one there, they're usually further back. They occur on both sides of the head. One weekend I got a bunch of these pains deep in my ear. I'll also get random pains elsewhere on seemingly unrelated parts of my body - ie; left thumb, right knee, left thigh, etc. These aren't very bothersome and are much more infrequent.\n\n-Other: Neurological exam normal. MRI without contrast came back normal except for a hyperintensity in the frontal lobe. Neurologist attributed this to migraine sequelae and refused to investigate further. MRA of head and neck, with contrast, came back normal. Right dominant vertebrobasilar system if that means anything.

This is a continuing issue for which nobody seems to be able to find an answer, So I am hoping for a suggestion that I may followup to rule out the cause.\nAbout 9 months ago my 3rd and 4th toe began to experience pins and needles.  I thought nothing of it for a while, but over time my toes became numb. As time progressed, that numbness graduated to pain.  During this period I complain to the doctor who suggested Mortons Nueroma and requested an Ultrasound. When those results did not show anything, I went in for an MRI, which also showed nothing. A second ultrasound confirmed these results. A nuerologist also found nothing.  I'm now out of ideas.\n\nHow the issue presents:\n\nNo discolouration presents.  Blood flow to the tissue appears normal. Any pain feels like it's coming form the inside around the joint rather than the tissue. Pins and needles no longer presents - just numbness and pain.\nMore recently, swelling presents between the 3rd/4th metatarsal, particularly when walking.\nMore curiously, similar swelling has begun to present on the right foot (although no toes numbness).\n\nRelief Practices:\n\nI have been using a metatarsal pad to try to reduce the impact on my foot, which seems to offer mild help. \nI have also tried taking an Paracetamol \\ Ibuprofen pill.\nIt should be noted that drinking lots of fluid seems to offer some relief.  I don't know why this would be the case.\nLast night, I was trying to massage my left foot and pulled back my toes.  This instantly seemed to lock my toes in place and caused some pain.  I reversed the practice and pushed my toes in toward the foot.  This seemed to relieve the pain.  \nA foot doctor has so far recommended stretching the calf, which curiously seems to have helped the right foot since the swelling seems to have gone when walking. The stretching has not helped the left foot\\toes.\n\nWhat's next?\n\nI would like to know where to go next.  What can I do to find the solution?  Obviously I would not like for the end result to be any major surgery, so would like to head the issue off at the pass.\nIf you're a doctor browsing Reddit, perhaps you may be able to offer a thought on the matter.\n\nWith respect."

Before the medication I was sleeping ten hours a day, had a constant fog/ feeling of not knowing what was going on, was in chronic pain everyday, had migraines non stop, completely haulted my fairly active lifestyle ( yoga three times a week, hiking, walking everyday), I couldn't get myself out of bed, had severe tingling in my limbs and would lose feeling in my hands very often, this all led me to having to quit my job of seven years. With the medication I have gone back to some activity, easy walks with my pupper is the biggest, but I have a mental fog fairly often still, and still feel bad pain, I'm tender to the touch, even the briefest touch of fingers against my back feels like I'm being burned, I am still chronically tired all the time  (but at least I'm not sleeping the whole day anymore), if I try to knit or hold a book my fingers tingle. There's a lot honestly but it's such an improvement from where I was last year before medication. My real questions are, does this sound like Fibromyalgia? That is the only lead they have given me but have not diagnosed me with it. Is there a specialist someone can recommend I try next? Does this sound like something else? I really just want to know what the hell my body is doing so I can seek the best path to take care of myself. I have not drank in over two years, I do not smoke or do drugs of any sort, I do vape sometimes if that helps at all. I'm not looking to get drugged up, I just want my life back. Thanks in advance if anyone actually reads all this!"

The following is as detailed of a history as I could put together, but if you have any questions please don't hesitate to ask. I just want to figure out what is wrong here and help her feel better again. \n\n \n\n**Health Timeline and Overview of Appointments**\n\n**March 2019-** \n\nWent to a dermatologist for a fungal/bacterial infection? Rash and swelling on foot and hands. Was treated with a cream, and the swelling seemed to go away.\n\n**April 2019-** \n\nStarted feeling lethargic and noticed salivary gland swelling for the first time. We decided to wait and see what was going on before seeing a doctor. \n\n**May 2019-**\n\nGolden Week- (May 5-11) Went on 2 hikes, in Agatsuma and Numata.\n\nMay 12-18 -   \nWas sick to stomach, constant nausea, heart palpitations, pain, fevers and night sweats, and weight loss (5lbs in a week).\n\nWe went to a hospital with (JTE at Takajo) on May 17th.\n\nDoctor couldn\u2019t find anything wrong, blood test was normal. Doctor said, \u201cI can do a CT Scan if it will make you feel better?\u201d We do not have these blood test results. \n\nThat weekend we called an ambulance due to the pain and heart palpitations, was discharged on May 18th(?)\n\nMay 20-   \nCalled another ambulance and went to Takasaki General Medical Center where I was admitted and examined by a doctor there.   \nWas kept overnight on an IV drip. Did a CT scan, which is when we discovered that the salivary gland was swollen and that the test results indicated some form of infection. \n\nHe suspected rubella, but I was vaccinated for this and other diseases when I was a child. \n\nMay 21- \n\nReleased from the hospital, ordered to stay home from school one week. Medicine prescribed. \n\n**Blood Test Results (5/24)**: High Calcium, Low Average RBC, High Neutrophils, Low Lymphocytes, Low Eosinophils, Low MCV, Low MCH, Low UN(BUN), Low Potassium. \n\n**Medicines Prescribed:** \n\nLansoprazole (stomach medicine) \n\nMosapride (stomach medicine) \n\nMay 27-   \nAnother visit to Takasaki General, medicine prescribed. ENT at Takasaki General Medical Center was suggested.\n\n**Blood Test Results (5/27):** High EBV-EBNA, High EB.VCA-IgG, High IgG for Mumps, Measles, Rubella, Low MCV, Low MCH, Low Lymphocytes (but Neutrophils were normal), Low UN(BUN), Low CK(CPK), Low eGFR. \n\n**Medicines Prescribed:**   \nCalonal Tablet 300 (NSAID pain relief)\n\nNexium Capsules 10 (stomach medicine)\n\nLevofloxacin Tablets 500mg (antibiotics)\n\n**June 2019-** \n\nJune 3-   \nBlood Test.  \n\n\n**Blood Test Results (6/3):** High RBC, Low MCV, Low MCH, Low MCHC, Low Lymphocytes (Neutrophils still normal), Low eGFR.\n\nJune 13- \n\nDoctor thinks symptoms are stress-related and suggests counseling.  ENT seen for the first time, suggested it was a salivary gland infection. He thought that something was making the salivary duct shrink. We asked him to check my ears, as I was feeling ear pain. He checked and said they were fine. More medicine prescribed. \n\n**Blood Test Results (6/13):** High CH50, Low MCV, Low MCH, Low Eosinophils, Low Lymphocytes, High Neutrophils, Low eGFR.\n\n**Medicines Prescribed:**  \n Prednisolone Tablets 5mg (steroid)\n\nFamotidine OD Tablet 20mg (stomach medicine)\n\nAzunol Gargle 4% 5ml (mouth gargle for uclers)\n\nJune 24-    \nWe told them the medicine wasn\u2019t working to alleviate the symptoms, and that the swelling was still the same. The ENT questioned us. I told him about how I had started experiencing nerve pain, and when asked about it, the ENT said, \u201cThat\u2019s strange.\u201d He then said, \u201cWell, we can do an MRI if you want, but it will take 3 weeks to get you an appointment.\u201d We agreed to the MRI. \n\n**Medicines Prescribed:**\n\nMethylcobalamin Tablets 50o (Vitamin B12)\n\nTocopherol Nicotinate Capsule 100mg (Vitamin E)\n\nJune 26-   \nStarted counseling with Chiralaine Natschke from BetterHelp\n\nLCPC 180.010761\n\n**July 2019-**\n\nJuly 2-   \nHeadaches and pressure in head, neck feeling stiff, body parts starting to feel numb and in pain, specifically in the tongue, left side of chin, extremities, occasionally entire arm.\n\nJuly 6- \n\nFalling asleep suddenly, waking up with persistent, nauseating headaches that would last for multiple hours. Headaches were primarily back of the head or left side of the head.\n\nJuly 8- \n\nBlood Test.\n\n**Blood Test Results (7/8):** Low MCV, Low MCH, High Neutrophils, Low Lymphocytes.\n\nJuly 7-   \nSudden unexplained bruising, headaches, rashes primarily on extremities, fever.\n\nJuly 9-   \nMRI results show swelling in gland, nothing seen inside. \n\nJuly 12-   \nBlood Test, ENT visit, medicine prescribed. \n\n**Medicines Prescribed:** \n\nTsumura Kakkonto Extract title 2.5 g/ Pack (Chinese Medicinal Herb) \n\nJuly 13- \n\nJoint pain, nausea.\n\nJuly 14- \n\nNearly blacked out from headaches and dizziness. We went to Kurosawa Hospital and saw a neurologist who did an MRI of the brain and found nothing. The neurologist suggested that it may be a viral infection that may have infected the nervous system. He also asked if the heart had been checked, and it had not.   \nPain and nausea medicine and anti-vertigo medicine prescribed.\n\nJuly 20-   \nJoint pain returns. We considered if lyme disease was a possibility. \n\nJuly 26- \n\nA new painful lump formed under the left ear overnight. The neck pain was bad, but did disappear after two days. Symptoms of a fever and lightheadedness throughout the weekend. \n\nJuly 29- \n\nWe visited Doctorearly with no appointment because of the new painful lump.We requested a lyme disease test. Doctor  claimed that he only treated one other person with Lyme and that \u201calmost everyone with lyme disease dies.\u201d He was very dismissive and made a point to say that he had a lot of other people to see. He finally suggested that I had a mood disorder.   \nWhen asked about the new lump on my neck, he hardly felt my neck before passing it off as just a sore muscle and suggesting a massage. We had Doctor write a recommendation letter to Gunma University Hospital. In this letter, he wrote, \u201cI think the patient has a mood disorder, but she insists this is something medical\u201d.\n\n**Medicines Prescribed:**\n\nEthyl Loflazepate Tablet 1mg (sleeping medicine) \n\n**August 2019-** \n\nJuly 30- Aug 4 \u2013   \nVery few symptoms present aside from the swollen lymph nodes, feeling slightly better.\n\nAug 5-   \nLeft knee became inflamed and painful. We went to doctor near my high school and had my leg examined and x-rayed. They could not find anything abnormal except for inflammation. Topical cream was prescribed to help with the inflammation\n\n**Medicines Prescribed:**\n\nDiclofenac Sodium cream 1% 25g\n\nAug 9- \n\nNew lump had not gone away and was still hard to the touch. We decided to go to a new ENT.\n\nAug 10- \n\nWe visited the new ENT in the Monterey building at Takasaki Station (Masako Furukawa). She said that the lump was a swollen lymph node due to an ear infection, and prescribed antibiotics. \n\n**Medicines Prescribed:**\n\nCefcapene Pivoxil Hydrochloride 100mg (antibiotic)\n\nCalonal Tablets 300 mg (NSAID pain relief)\n\nAug 14-   \nExperienced popping joints, pain, and more swollen lymph nodes in the back and side of neck. \n\nAug 15- \n\nWe made our first visit to Gunma University Hospital, seeing a general practice doctor there. \n\nBlood tests, urine test, and EKG was done. Most test results back the same day, and he said they were all mostly normal. The doctor felt the lymph nodes and said they were not swollen enough to be concerned about, but we could do another MRI or CT scan if we wanted to. He also said that next week, we would come to see a dermatologist first at the next appointment, and then we would discuss the rest of the test results.   \n\n\nAfter leaving that appointment we noticed in the blood test that the lymphocyte count was very low and the doctor had not talked about that with us, so we went back to talk to him before leaving the hospital. He explained that some people naturally have lower lymphocytes, and since we do not have a blood test from when I was healthy, we have no way of knowing if that is normal or not. \n\n**Blood Test Results (8/15):** Low MCV, Low MCH, Low MCHC, High MPV, High Neutrophils, Low Lymphocytes, High HDL Cholesterol, VERY LOW IggA (5, normal range is 110 to 410).\n\nAug 17- \n\nAt the ENT check up, she said that the ear infection was getting better, and she gave me another dose of the previous medicine. She said that I had an ear infection and may have caught a cold from having a weakened immune system. \n\nAug 20- \n\nHands and feet falling asleep again, knees locking up so it was hard to walk. \n\nAug 22- \n\nAt the dermatologist, he checked the neck and suggested that the disease could be something similar to fibromyalgia, based on the rashes and joint pain. \n\nThe general practice doctor later said the dermatologist was wrong. He thought there was nothing wrong with me. He suggested stress and mental issues were the problem. We asked how anxiety or stress could cause swollen lymph nodes, and informed him of the fact that I had been in counseling for many months due to the pain. The counselor had stated that these symptoms were not brought on by my mental health. The doctor refused to answer any further questions, or do any new tests, and suggested that I check into a mental hospital. We specifically asked about doing a lymph node biopsy to check what was going on, and he refused. \n\nAug 22- continued\n\nWe had another check up at the ENT and explained that I wasn't been feeling better. We asked if the lymph nodes should be something to be concerned about. The ENT said that she was not worried, and to wait a few weeks before coming back in to see if anything has progressed.\n\n**Current Symptoms:** \n\nAug 24-   \nRight arm felt tense. I felt a moderate stabbing pain in the arm, and when I touched the location of the pain, the skin felt hot and firm. My left arm did not show these symptoms and was cool to the touch. After about an hour, the right arm returned to normal. \n\nAug 26- \n\nMorning: Chest pain, Stomach pain, night sweats/ fever, itchy ears, stuffy nose, sore throat, head fog, nausea.\n\nDay: Chin itching on left side (side of swollen salivary glands and lymph nodes), itchy ear that popped constantly, stinging pain in hand and wrist, small rash on hand and wrist, nerve pain in hand, visible veins in hand, left arm shooting pain. \n\nEvening: back pain, pain in the neck, pain in the salivary gland, ears, and lymph nodes."

I have not exercised at all today. \n\nMy watch tells me that average heart rate should be 60-78 or something like that but mine is at 84. I have been wearing the watch for a week. My heart rate can go up and down anywhere from 5-10bpm every few minutes because it monitors in real time.\n\nDoes any of this sound abnormal or dangerous as far as heart rate goes? I don't have any other symptoms other than sometimes I get short episodes of left sided chest pain that feels stabby (just a single stabbing sensation maybe once every 10 min or so for a period of half an hour) periodically for no reason, but I think it might be musculoskeletal. It doesn't even happen daily, or even weekly. Comes and goes.\n\nI was at the doc 2 months ago and they said my heart sounded good.

(For more info on antihistamine withdrawal: https://elemental.medium.com/quitting-zyrtec-is-total-hell-c3e79d753a1a) *To be clear, I do not have questions about the withdrawal process, I have done exhaustive research.

The FDA has not recognized the withdrawal as a major side effect yet. \n\nProbiotics, gut health, histamine intolerance, layering with other allergy medicines, dermatological issues, liver issues, anxiety, heart palpitations, insomnia, and a list of other treatments and symptoms may come along with the withdrawal process.\n\n****My question is this: what type of medical professional can I contact to help me through this process? I think a GP would probably roll the eyes (many people going through the process have reported doctors are unresponsive). I'm trying to find someone who is either an appropriate specialist or a doctor that will have the curiosity to attack a new problem. Does that exist?\n\nTLDR; Withdrawing from antihistamine causes countless excruciating side effects. It is a newer medical issue and I need an appropriate medical professional to help with the process, but don't know where to turn."

        "reddit": "**Disclosure**: This will be a relatively long post, so many apologies in advance for the wall of text. \n\n**Medical History**: As a child I had to use a *nebulizer*, this machine that made liquid medicine (?) into steam and I had to inhale it. However, it has been a while since I used the machine. Also recently, for whatever reason, certain doctors believe that I suffer from severe *anxiety*. In addition, for over a decade now since 2008 (probably 2009) I dealt (still deal) with *phlegm*. \n\n**Family Medical History**: Recently my grandmother passed away from *cancer--*she was hospitalized late July of 2018 and passed in October of 2018*--*while she also suffered from *diabetes* and was a *hypochondriac*. My grandfather also died from cancer a couple weeks after she passed. Also, a lot of my relatives suffer from mental illnesses like *schizophrenia* or *bipolar disorder*.  \n\n**All my symptoms**: Weight loss, loss of appetite, discomfort and pressure all over my body like if I'm sitting down in a certain position, feeling tipsy, chest pain, difficulty breathing, vision problems--seeing things that aren't there like flashes or spots of blue and seeing floating stars in the sky or black strings (?) and eye twitching, bowel movement lacking (this one started around the same time I stopped eating for prolonged periods of time), peeing frequently (I drink roughly 3 or 4 bottles of Arrowhead 1 QT), abdominal pain (? kind of, more like discomfort), blood pressure might be dropping or raising (?), headache (currently), phlegm, sometimes I feel detached from what I'm doing and feel confused or scared, sudden jolts like I get up from laying down and it feels like I'm having a heart attack, sometimes when I stand up it feels like I'll pass out.\n\n**Context**: I'm a 20 year old male, about to turn 21 next month, Hispanic. I weigh about... maybe 145, that was my last measurement less than two weeks ago. I started working out last August (around the same time I noticed changes), running four days out of the week, going to the gym three days out of the week, for about 5 months. In that period, I lost about 10-15 pounds, going from 180 to 170. Ever since then my diet and exercise has been non-existent. \n\nLast night and the previous night, I suffered either a near heart attack or just an anxiety episode. It felt like every time I tried to fall asleep, my body would jolt back up because my breathing grew difficult and I couldn't feel my heart beat. I was close, less than a second away, from getting up and rushing to the hospital. But it went away and I don't want to experience that again. I'm at the point right now where it's just becoming a burden, where I feel like a burden and that all I want to do is sleep away my life. \n\nIt doesn't feel like what's causing this is anxiety or depression or even ocd. I'm certain, beyond positive, that what I have is *hypertension*\\--low and high blood pressure, *GERD* or *crohn's disease*, definitely something related to my stomach, *nerve damage*, *heart disease*, *IBS* and most likely *diabetes*. \n\nA couple of doctors and nurses claimed that my livers or kidneys were functioning normal when I did various urine tests, but if I pee frequently then it really doesn't add up. Same thing for the high/low blood pressure and *heart disease*, a nurse at the USC laughed when I mentioned it saying how I was too young and that my bp spiked due to stress and me panicking--which doesn't make sense. And my old doctor, before I switched, said that what I have or could have is *GERD* or *acid reflux*, while they never confirmed it, \"anyone can get it\" that's what my old doctor said. Plus they gave me some medicine for that, even though it didn't do anything for me. And my new doctor keeps believing anxiety is the major factor for my sudden decline in health, which ignores how I feel and all the underlying diseases. Besides having low vitamin D--which is known to be linked to various illnesses like *cancers* and *heart defects* and *diabetes*, no one seems to believe me.\n\nTomorrow I have a followup with my primary doctor because I missed last weeks, and I want to request further tests. An endoscopy for my stomach, a MRI scan because I had way too many x-rays done on me so I don't need any more radiation, my request for a cardiologist went through so I have it next month, more blood tests and a test to see if my kidneys or livers are working. \n\nMy question splits into two. First one: How do I convince my doctor to order more tests? Second one: Should I spend the night at the hospital, just in case I suffer a stroke or a heart attack?"

The idea of death makes me very happy, and I find comfort in the fact that I have control over the death of myself and others. I hate it when I go into this state of mind and it genuinely freaks me out, which is where I feel like my harm ocd came from.

None affected my appetite. Even unmedicated I can\u2019t eat food as much. I\u2019ve tried for 2 months straight trying to eat 3 meals a day and trying to snack as well but I just can\u2019t. Everyday I have low energy, fatigue, and my motivation is barely there. Even if I force myself to make some food, I can only eat 1 meal at best but it\u2019s easily prepared (microwaveable food, pizza, noodles, etc.). After I finish my meal I\u2019m basically done eating for the day. I try and force myself to make another meal later but I don\u2019t have a appetite even for snacks like chips or pizza. When I start school, this becomes even more of a problem because I don\u2019t eat lunch at school because I\u2019m too tired and have low energy to make the food or I don\u2019t have a appetite (which is the main reason). I\u2019m basically at school for 8 hours, not hungry at all and when I get hungry after school, I\u2019m too tired or too unmotivated to even put food in my mouth and chew. The cause is likely my clinical depression since I was 16 but my psychiatrist told me to eat 3 meals a day but I don\u2019t have the energy to even chew the food, it requires too much energy and I don\u2019t have a appetite and food doesn\u2019t taste so good when I\u2019m depressed or not hungry.\n\nI know that I am 240 pounds but it\u2019s because I do no physical activity and when I eat, it\u2019s processed GMO sugary high carb foods. \nI\u2019ve even went on a high carb diet to make myself hungry but that doesn\u2019t do anything except make me really tired which then make it more difficult to eat. I also have been sleeping fine, I get 8+ hours everyday (most times 12+hrs). \n\nI feel like there isn\u2019t much that you can help me with because my depression is likely the cause of all of this but I\u2019d really like to enjoy my food again and eat 3 meals a day instead of 1 because it doesn\u2019t get me through the day.\n\nIs there any medications that stimulate appetite? I\u2019ve already tried SSRIs and 1 anti-psychotic with no success but if there\u2019s a medication that IMMENSELY boosts appetite, I would really like to know."

My breast pain comes back. \nBy August, it\u2019s up to 3-4 days I have to rest. I prone to high anxiety and I start having minor panic attacks.\nI go and get blood work done on August 14. It comes back exactly like Mays. I\u2019m now up to 7 days of required rest. I can\u2019t function. I\u2019m not working. I\u2019m pretty much immobile.\nI go to see my dr on the 16. She says my numbers are good and there\u2019s nothing more she can treat me for. She does prescribe me lexapro.\nI get an apt with an Integrated dr. He orders a ton of tests related to thyroid. I go and get the blood work done on Saturday. I HATE needles and when I see there are 10 viles needed, I flip out. Have a minor panic attack at lab.\nL\nDuring the 2-3 weeks I\u2019ve been experiencing some uncomfortable feelings in my left armpit along with breast pain. It doesn\u2019t really hurt, just noticeable. Both my integrated dr and primary have checked my neck for swelling and have not found any.\nAlso over the last week, my seasonal allergies (or at least I think are allergies) have flared up. I\u2019ve developed an occasional dry cough, increase pressure around my throat and keep feeling like I\u2019m starting to get a soar throat, but haven\u2019t. Also, constant eye watering. I feel feverish, but have not had a fever (some of this also could be stress as this seems to only occur when I\u2019m on the internet researching cancers and my heart starts pounding).\nMy blood work came back today. I\u2019ve been so nervous thinking I had cancer or something. I haven\u2019t slept, can\u2019t sit still, super jittery. On Thursday I also stopped taking my Armour because I felt like I didn\u2019t know what else to do. So when I go and get my blood work, I\u2019ve been off of it 3 days.\nMy blood work concerns\nTSH 11.00 Range .30-4.20\nT4 Free .64 Range .70-1.50\nVitamin D 28 Range 30-80\nWBC 12.21 x 10(3) Range:4.20 x10(3)/uL - 12.10 x10(3)/uL\nLymph Absolute \n4.2 x10(3)/uL Range:0.5 x10(3)/uL - 3.7 x10(3)/uL\nAll other blood work in range.\n\nAt this point, I actually feel relief. I know my thyroid is out of whack and know it needs fixed. I decide to call my dr and ask to get back on levo. Obviously, Armour is not working for me. Before I can call her, she calls me personally. This has NEVER happened. At first she just talks about the tsh. Then she says she is concerned about my WBC and wants to repeat tests in 2 weeks. \nI\u2019m now freaking out and convinced I have cancer again. I\u2019m back to not sleeping and heart pounding. My relief lasted just a few hours and now I\u2019m so scared again. I don\u2019t even know how I can make it 2 weeks. \n\nIs lymphoma, leukemia something I should be concerned about with these symptoms? I\u2019m so nervous I don\u2019t even know what to do."

Thats sort of a lie because one time i was peeing blood and went to the emergency room but it was just a bad UTI. The doctor treated me like i was trash and it was a bad experience. Like, i didnt know what was wrong and i was worried and they acted like i was stupid to be at the emergency but i didnt know what else to do. In hindsight i know a uti is no big deal and not a reason to go to the emergency.\n\nBut other than that, even as a child my dad never took me to the doctor not even once so i dont really know how to get a doctor or how to see one other than ER or urgent care but i feel that i need...general doctoring. Not urgent or emergency. And i just am not sure how this all works.\n\nI live in the USA. Basically, i feel very sick. Like, extreme fatigue to the point that i am okay for about an hour an hour after i wake up, then its back downhill. I feel so weak i barely want to get up but i have been forcing myself because i have to work. My muscles are sore and i have this stomach problem where i get extremely hungry really fast after eating. I also am nauseous a lot and my stomach burns like almost 24-7. I feel really really sick. Thats the only way i can really describe it and i dont know if i have a vitamin deficiency but i dont throw up really, im just nauseous all the time or am dehydrated, but again i dont vomit hardly ever or have diarrhea. I drink a lot of water and fluids. I also have some mental confusion at times, forgetfulness, muscle twitches, and this weird dizziness that strikes out of nowhere and lasts only 30 seconds or so but will come in waves when it does of like 2 or 3. It doesn't happen too often but very noticeable when it does. At least once a day.\n\nI just need some advice on how do i actually find a doctor who can do blood tests and see if i have a vitamin deficiency or some other illness that is making me sick? Also how do i describe my symptoms without sounding like a complete loon?  I do not have insurance and i can pay out of pocket."

I'm constantly exhausted and have to take 4-5 hour naps every day, even with 8 hours of sleep. I can sleep a full night and need to nap a couple hours after waking up. It's almost to the point of narcolepsy, in which I can just fall asleep and not even notice I'm falling asleep. I have an appointment with a pulmonologist in December for a sleep study. I wake up with headaches about \u00be of the time, and also get migraines 2-3 times per week. On top of that, I've always had weight issues. I can gain weight like no one's business, and it's almost impossible to lose. I've been as low as 130 pounds and as high as 180. Even with dieting and exercise, weight doesn't budge. On top of all of this, I've had what doctors believe to be is IBS since I was 14. It's like IBS on steroids though. It doesn't respond to medical management, so I try my best with diet. I lose hair often, which I attribute to the stress of being a veterinarian, but who knows. I saw my PCP last week and had some bloodwork done. My BMP, CBC diff, TSH, and FT4 all came back within normal limits. The only outstanding value is my cortisol, which is low. I was referred to an endocrinologist, but won't be able to see him until December when I'm home next. I was hoping to get some insight here and see what some of you had to think, just to fuel my own curiosity, since none of my clinical signs and values quite align with just one apparent differential.

        "reddit": "Head Sensations \n\n33 / Caucasian / Male\n \nThis is gonna be a long story with lots of details, not great with words but will do the best I can. \n\nIn about September of 2018 I went to the ENT because was having ear issues out of nowhere. Both of my ears were really itchy, swollen middle ears and dry skin. Was very uncomfortable  They said I had Eczema and prescribed dermotic oil and a cream to use when they got inflamed as well as a Medrol pack. I went back in December because my ears were inflamed and itching but was told they didn\u2019t want to prescribe another medrol pack. To come back in 2 weeks if the problem persists. 2 weeks later in January 2019, I went to the Emergency Room because my ears were hurting bad at 2 am. They gave me an antibiotic shot and some other steroids. It wiped the ear issues out. \n\nIn the beginning of February of 2019, I quit chewing tobacco after 17 years. I couldn\u2019t sleep for a couple weeks and then all of a sudden I started getting these odd head sensations in my head after the second week. It was a feeling that radiated from above my ears to my temple. A whooshing/vibrating feeling that would start above the ears to the temple then squeeze. After a few weeks of this, in late March or early April I went to see my family physician. He attributed it all to be tension type headaches and prescribed me Maxalt 10mg when I get migraine and to start taking the Fioricet 50-300-30mg. This didn\u2019t work and I ended up doubling the medication at his request with no relief. \n\nAbout 2 weeks later I ended up in the ER and got a CT of my head because the squeezing in my temples would not stop. Again they found nothing and attributed it to tension headaches. \n\nIn April my ears started to flare up again so I went back to the ENT. I asked him to test my inner ears to make sure everything  was good and he did some sort of pressure tests and hearing tests. All came back normal and he attributed everything in my ears to Eczema.\n\nBack to square one I went back to my family physician in April. He scheduled an MRI of my brain and blood tests. Only thing out of sorts was vitamin D and everything else was normal. He then referred me to a neurologist. \n\nIn late May I got into the neurologist, and he wanted to try Lyrica. After 1 or 2 weeks with nothing getting better and the sensations becoming more intense I couldn\u2019t get ahold of the neurologist again. \n\nBack to my family physician for another referral to a different neurologist. This time I got more blood tests and a cervical MRI. (18 years ago I had a compression fracture of my C5 or C6 during football). At the time the inflammation was back in my ears as well and I was prescribed Zithromax and Neomycin. \n\nBelow are the findings from the MRI. \n \nCervical MRI findings \n\nC5-C6: Mild disc osteophyte complex with partial attenuation of the anterior thecal sac. There is no significant central canal stenosis. Minimal spondylosis. Neural foramina remain patent bilaterally at this level. \n\nMy personal physician referred me to a pain management doctor because he thought I needed injections in my neck. The pain management doctor and new neurologist thought my symptoms sounded like I was having issues with my occipital nerves (Greater and Lesser) and was given a occipital nerve block. \n\nThis did nothing to alleviate the feelings I was having and actually made me have really bad headaches. \n\nI went back to the Neurologist 2 weeks later and was back to square one. This time she wanted to try Amitriptyline at 25mg for 7 days and 50mg after. This actually made me; \ndepressed feeling \ncouldn\u2019t function\nZombie like\nWhole head felt numb\n\nI lasted 9 days and couldn\u2019t take it anymore. Once I quit this medicine and it\u2019s affects had worn off I had 2 new sensations happening. The first sensation feels like something is pushing/pulling upwards on my top teeth and roof of my mouth. It\u2019s like a pressure feeling that makes it feel like my top teeth aren\u2019t mine, like I have fake teeth  the second sensation is a feeling of something squeezing on both sides of the bridge of my nose. \n\nMy next step was to the dentist on August 23. They gave me a full exam with 18 xrays to see if my teeth were causing these new sensations. The dentist didn\u2019t believe my teeth were the cause of this and ruled out Bruxism as well. \n\nAll the Neurologist wants to do now is prescribe me a different anti-depressant/Nerve block drug, but I can\u2019t take medicine like that, makes me feel crazy. \n\nCurrent Sensations:\nSqueezing Sensation in temple\nNeck pain at base of skull and cervical spine\nPushing/pulling upwards on my top teeth and roof of my mouth.\nSqueezing on both sides of the bridge of my nose\n\n\nAny help or suggestions? This is becoming unbearable and it drives me crazy. The feelings always except when I first wake up in the morning. About 30 minutes after I wake up, the sensations back and it varies in intensity throughout the day but always more intense in the afternoon. \n\nThanks everyone."

I went from being usually consistently a bit under 140 for years to about 125 by February/March. Since then, I have kept losing more and more weight. I am currently 118 pounds. I eat terribly to be quite honest - fast food, junk food, carbs, anything sugary, you name it. I\u2019ve even made a conscious effort to try to put on weight and it hasn\u2019t gone up at all which is normally not like me. I\u2019m so tired of buying new clothes to fit. I\u2019ve shrugged it off until now, but I do now realize I am hitting the brink of being underweight, which is making me a little concerned. \n\nHistory of the past year - a new GP for a physical last year who had some concerns about my heart rate (resting 100-110ish, 120-135 when walking normally) and had repeated bloodwork for elevated platelets and WBCs. The WBC values were usually in the 15-20 range 3x over 5 months. Had a peripheral blood smear done, nothing remarkable. Other than that and a bad case of the flu, I\u2019ve been healthy and have had no abnormal symptoms. \n\nMoral of the story - my deductible is insanely high and I\u2019m broke as hell. If I am going to make an annual appointment with my (very booked and busy) doctor who probably won\u2019t remember me, I want to be able to ask the right questions or say the right things to get on the road to some answers (or tell me if I should just not be concerned at all please - fully open to that possibility) to save her time and to save my wallet. Doctor also currently has no appointments available until January, so if it is in my best interest to see someone before then, I am open to doing so. \n\nAny thoughts or advice would be really appreciated.

Rambeling when speaking. Bring 'spacy'. \n\n3.  forgetfulness, this one is huge. I forget words, my keys, my shoes, I forgot pants one day last week, until my son pointed it out, as i was walking out to work. This one is affecting my ability to do my job, managing people and helping clients. I will take a phone call, write notes and promptly forget what I was doing, until they call back 2 days later because I did not do what I said I was going to do. I am forgetting apointments for my kid, and me. I will walk into a room and have no idea why I am there. \n\n4. Inability to communicate. Forgetting word mid sentence. Inability to have a thought out conversation, or at times a conversation that another person can follow. \n\n5. Diarrhea. Quick acting, gotta go now kind.  I have no gal bladder. I will have diarrhea when my boss calls, an employee wants to talk to me about something I forgot, certain clients call or stop by. The diarrhea is bright yellow, and comes quickly. This can happen mulitpul times a day. Today was 3 for example. On the weekends,  I do not have this, or its not as severe. \n\n6. Shakes. I feel like I am constantly shaking or have the jitters. Not big ones. My hands are not as steady.\n\n7. Eyes go in and out of focus, to the point I cant see anything and it takes anywhere from 10-30 seconds to go back into focus.

I will not eat all day and get home and binge on whatever I can find. I have gained 40 lbs in 9 months. \n\n10. Emotionally and physically exhausted. \n\n11. All I want to do is curl up with my kid and nap.\n\n12. Lack of interest in anything I enjoy doing. I love video games, but have no drive to do it. Love cooking and hanging out with friends, but dont want to do it. I know this is my depression cramping up. I find when I am depressed, all I want to do is read to disappear. I have no interest in forming relationships with my team. I have no interest in their personal lives, or how they are doing.\n\n13. Want to drive in deep and 'fix' everything. All of this has affected my leadership ability at work. So to 'fix' it. I want to take all the classes, jump into a 6 month intense leadership program, or read all the leadership books I can find and apply all the techniques. This is not helpful. \n\n14. Spending money. I feel myself starting to spend money on crap I dont need. I feel in control this way. I have recognized this, so I have slowed down/stopped, but its freaking hard. \n\n15. I do not want to be at work. I hate every second I am there. I just want to run away screaming. Work used to be my happy place. My get away. \n\n16. Over commiting to activities. I have over commited myself to outside activities like coaching soccer, or helping at my kids school or in my service club. I am starting to drop the ball on these activities. \n\n17. Cry at the drop of a hat. Everything makes me cry. I am not normally a cryer. \n\n18. Over the past month I have been obsessed with mangos. I want to eat them all day long. \n\n\nI know there are more things, but I forget. \n\nI start therapy on Sept 16. I live rurally, so I could not find someone local.

I don't know of anyone in my family suffering from iron overload but my paternal grandmother died from non-alcoholic cirrhosis of the liver which I felt like might be mildly relevant to include. I am not taking iron supplements at all but I do eat a decent amount of  green leafy veggies. Subsequent blood tests came back \"normal\" (I never saw them) but when I asked my GP said she didn't repeat iron studies anyway because medicare wouldn't cover it. Do you think these serology results are normal enough that I shouldn't worry about it any further? Should I be concerned about hemachromatosis?"

However the past few days I haven't been able to sleep and getting that  heartburn feeling along with anxiety. Today I went to see a doctor who told me my diet consisted of to much Acid but when I asked if it was GERD they said weren't very clear but basically said no. They told me to go on CAP free diet, I was prescribed Ranitidine. I took it before dinner and felt fine until 1am couldn't sleep been burping and tight chest again. \n\nI feel like water doesn't help.

The effect was an inability to swallow and an extreme tightening of my throat. It is no exaggeration to say that I genuinely thought I was going to die because I felt like I couldn't breathe. The experience was pure hell and my anxiety levels skyrocketed. Eventually, I ended up slumping to the ground and experienced a very strange and almost inexplicable out of body experience where it felt like my mind was moving away from the rest of my body. \n\nWhat followed was this 4 week long feeling of fuzziness inside my head. It felt as though someone had poured led inside my head. I think I experienced depersonalisation. However, I'm not sure if it was triggered by the weed or just general anxiety - I have had issues with anxiety and OCD in the past. \n\nI never really felt like I \"lose my grip\" so to speak. Bar the extreme anxiety I still felt like I was me in the main sense, and I wasn't paranoid of others just scared I couldn't breathe. I did not struggling to articulate myself that night but again was that the panic attack or the weed? \n\nThen approximately 2 days later I get a nasty chest infection and I wake up one morning in an almost trance like state which was inexplicable. I remember I kept trying to move my arms a certain way until the movement was 'just right' and then I kind of broke out of the trance. It's almost like a dream seeped into my reality for half a minute after just waking up. \n\nThen the chest infection subsided and my brain fogginess went away after 4 weeks. \n\nAll is well, and I feel healthy but I read this article \n\nhttps://www.psychologytoday.com/au/blog/demystifying-psychiatry/201801/acute-marijuana-induced-psychosis-may-predict-future-illness \n\nWhich concerns me, because I'm now concerned that the weed might've caused me to experience psychosis? And this might then increase my chances of having schizophrenia down the road. \n\nTL;DR \n\nSmoked weed which caused me to cough lots and have a very dry mouth. Causing me to struggle to swallow and breathe, which led me to have an anxiety attack that I was going to suffocate to death. This panic then seemed to cause me to experience an out of body experience. \n\nI'm unsure if my out of body experience was the weed or just the general anxiety. \n\nAlso experienced a weird trance like state after waking up 2 days later, whilst I had a chest infection. I have no idea if this is related. \n\nBrain fogginess from the night I smoked weed persisted for around 4 to 6 weeks. \n\n**Did I experience psychosis from the weed? Or was it just my anxiety?**\n\n**Is the weird trance after waking up potentially normal or explained by non-weed factors?**\n\n**Am I at any real risk of developing psychosis or schizophrenia down the line because of this?** \n\nThank you so much for any help."

I\u2019ll start by saying yes I know I need to see a neurologist, I\u2019m working on getting health insurance. Basically wondering if it\u2019s serious enough that I need to get help now.\n\nI\u2019ve had migraines occasionally since I was sixteen, sucky but nothing longer than a few days. Until this past year, I\u2019ve had one nearly constantly. They last weeks with only a couple days\u2019 break in between. Worst before and during my period. I asked my gyno, she thinks it\u2019s probably not the iud as I\u2019ve had this brand before without issues. I\u2019ve been on magnesium for six months or so, it just helps the tension and muscle aches. Sumatriptan makes it considerably worse. Excedrin takes the edge off but I can\u2019t be taking it six times a day. I\u2019ve tried to just drink coffee and take Benadryl and aspirin, that seems like the best way to cope. But the pain and visual/speech disruptions are getting so bad, I don\u2019t know what to do any more. I\u2019ve tried to be more strict about my health, eating better foods and more regularly, sleeping 7-8 hours, etc. And exercise actually makes it worse. Sometimes I get really intense persistent overall muscle weakness, where it\u2019s hard to even open a door. Legs want to give out. Really dizzy and faint, especially when looking/stretching upwards.. is this even migraine? I assumed it was because I get the classic visual aura with the flecks of light/blurry/tunnel vision. Then the pain. But sometimes they\u2019ve been coming on with no aura, no warning. I thought it might be anemia but I had blood work done recently re: celiacs to check, everything was normal. \nThanks for reading \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd"

This pain comes for 5-15 minutes the goes again and sometimes doesn\u2019t return for days but usually within 12 hours it\u2019ll happen again for another few mins and repeat. \n\nHowever, yesterday was significant because the process repeated at a much faster rate, instead of 12 hour ish gaps it was about 10 minute gaps and went on for about an hour or so. Part way through this hour at a point where there was no chest pain my left shoulder suddenly had sharp pain inside and it felt like I had been stabbed. This pain lasted for about 2 minutes and I found that if I breathed in and held my breath it would go away. After doing this a few times it went away completely. \n\nToday I have had a little pain but it felt much more like what you get when you haven\u2019t eaten and nothing like the previous weeks pain. I\u2019ve had this before and it is very mild and almost irrelevant. However, since about midday (it\u2019s 4pm now) my throat has felt tight. I\u2019m having no trouble breathing, nor have I on any previous days, but it\u2019s just strange. Additionally my lower chest just feels strange but it\u2019s indescribable however there is no pain. Kind of like I\u2019ve had too much to eat but I certainly have not.\n\nTo give a picture of my general health, I am a 16 year old male with pretty bad anxiety but this is usually only triggered in high pressure situations. I am classified as average body fat however I am on the higher end of that but still healthy. My diet is relatively poor but not fatty. I am however very inactive and typically spend 80-90% of my waking hours sitting down. I can still run a 400m circuit for reference but this is exhausting.\n\nEvery single problem I have described has happened while sitting at my desk for at least 1 hour prior. My heart rate rests quite high at 70-80bpm and hasn\u2019t changed despite all of this. \n\nMy parents are a paramedic and a nurse and are not concerned but I want a second opinion.\n\nThanks everyone."

They kept me overnight at first bc my cardiac enzymes (triponin) were elevated in my bloodwork and with a family history of heart attacks they wanted to monitor me. I had 2 EKGs, a CT of my head, a chest X-Ray, and a Stress Test all which came back normal. They let me go the next day with a script for Ativan. Since then, I've had anxiety issues (had them before but now the fear of another panic attack has amplified it) and I still occassionally get a fast HR (not as fast as the original attack) and shortness of breath. \n\nAs for my concern, with each visit to the ER, my PCP, and urgent care I was concerned about it being a clot that manifested into PE. I don't exhibit the risk factors (non-smoker, no long travel recently, not obese, office job so I do sit a lot but I get up and move around occasionally at work) The one thing they asked that I kept saying no to was if I had fallen recently. I'm assuming they were looking for any trauma that could form a clot. Well, I said no, because I hadn't. I remembered today, however, that I got into a baddish ATV accident in March of this year that left a softball 1/2 size purple,red,blue bruise on the back of my thigh. Nothing broken and I had mobility, but is it possible that the trauma from 4 months ago could have caused a clot that manifested into a PE 4 months later? I'm sure this is my anxiety speaking, but thank you for taking the time to answer.\n\nTLDR; could trauma from a large bruise sustained when an ATV clipped my thigh cause a clot and PE 4 months later?"

The girl who said she didn't sleep for 30+ days. After, a couple of weeks after that post, I think I started sleeping at least 2-3 hours a day which is definitely better than how I was before that. I just feel like I'm all over the place. I feel like a bad person and people online call me a manipulator and abusive person. Their were a couple times this week that I have driven to a bridge but was unsuccessful finding parking to walk there and contemplate suicide. I even wrote a letter saying goodbye to my family. People think I'm doing all of this for attention online but I'm serious. I think I was either wrongly diagnosed or have both bipolar and bpd. I'm very impulsive as a person. I don't think I've had a depressive episode after the 30+ days of no sleep. \n\nI don't know if that has to do with my ADHD. I just also feel like it would be better for everyone around me as well as people I've talked to online that I leave this world. I think it would do everyone a favor. I think the reason why the last pshchiatrist diagnosed me with bipolar disorder was because I had a time in the past where I would have a episodes of no motivation during school semesters or the summer. I have flunked so many times because of no motivation and just doubting myself as well as losing jobs due to not wanting to get out of bed or not wanting to go to work. Anxiety has also played a role. \n\nDuring the 30 days of no sleep, I went to the hospital multiple times because of the bad anxiety and sleeping issue. I think the spending issue could possibly be related to both bpd and bipolar disorder because I have not spend so much money like actually maxing out my credits cards all the time. Only time I did this was last month as well as the beginning of this month and last year during my birthday maybe. During last year, I made a post about being potentially schizphrenic because I was extremely terrified of my house and saw ghosts as well as heard things here and there. This year and last year I would hear my name being called at work or home but nobody would say it or nobody was there. I got kicked out of a university last year because my GPA was so bad for 3 semester's. \n\nI would self harm in the my car in the parking lot. I also do that sometimes out of anger, punishment, and sometimes to feel pain for no reason. I also have been on and off with being very hypersexual. I have never had sex before but I've been really frustrated lately. I feel like I don't know who I am anymore. Anyway, I'm babbling and am sorry about that. I probably missed a couple things. I would rather thing having borderline personality disorder to be surprising because I don't think I've ever been abused. Also, I forgot to mention during the time of not sleeping for 30+ days and other symptoms I was very irritable and snapped a couple times by breaking some of the items I really cherished. I drive when I'm really upset and sometimes recklessly or I'm like numb or zoned out. That happened yesterday. Almost got into a couple accidents the day I really thought I should end it. \n\nI also forgot to mention that during the 30+ days of no sleep I was hearing and seeing things here and there but nothing like last year. That was the worst time of my life. I would beg my parents to come home because I was so afraid of being home alone and getting attacked by something or someone. I'm not going to lie, I think drugs are poison but at the same time I want someone to help me. I'm just afraid. I feel like I'm losing control of everything. People online that I've talked to think I'm crazy because I overreacted about someone acting like me on my discord account and I thought I was genuinely being hacked and freaking out over it via text. So they banned me. I have really bad anger outbursts but it's usually when im provoked or when I feel like I'm being attacked most of the time or made fun of. I don't think I've been in a depressive episode after the 30 days of no sleep. \n\nAnyway, I'm sorry I'm all over the place. Maybe I'm just an attention seeker. It's what people online tell me but all I want is for someone to help me and card about me. I'm seeing a neurologist another psychiatrist and another appointment at a hospital I think with a therapist in a couple weeks. I just want someones professional opinion on all of this. Am I a toxic person? I'm just frustrated with my entire life and just everything going on. I don't know what to do. I'm trying weed for the first time this week. I went to great lengths to get it because I think maybe it'll fix me."

That\u2019s kinda slowed down to be not as bad during the years. \n\nI\u2019m underweight (just always been a picky eater whose had trouble gaining weight) about 105 pounds. \n\nSo back probably around February I started having a pain in my rib. It was kinda like a burning sensation. That night I had jumped on the trampoline so I associated it with that. I\u2019m not sure how often it would occur, but I still get them now. I can\u2019t say if it\u2019s better or worse, but it doesn\u2019t seem to bother me as much anymore. It\u2019s usually when I\u2019m laying down at night, but it can happen any times. It\u2019s alway the left rib, although sometimes it happens on both sides, just not as bad on the right \n\nI also have back pain. Not sure when this started, but it may be associated with me lifting weights, which I started a few months ago. However, I haven\u2019t lifted them In a few days but still get the pain. It\u2019s likely due to bad posture, something I would like to fix but not sure how. A lot of times I wake up with it. \n\nI also have pain in my left knee. Usually when sitting down, but sometimes while walking. This started back in March I think, when I went on a 6 hour trip. \n\nI think I had pain in that knee before, because when I started in March I could remember dealing with it years ago. \n\nPlease note that my breathing usually only gets bad when my allergies flair up, or when I start getting real active like running very hard or laughing very hard at night \n\nThe thing that\u2019s scaring me is that these look like symptoms of lung cancer.

But it put so much stress on me that I could barely come close to finishing the first half of a second year - and then I've entirely skipped the rest of my classes, preferring instead to rest day by day in my room, listening to music and procrastinating.\n\nSo I've been expelled - and, instead of listening to my pleas to dropping college completely, my family has decided to appoint me to another one. And then, after I've missed the entirety of my classes there, I've got expelled again. So my family has decided to appoint me to a yet another college. This ended up in a pretty much the same story, except that I've nearly took my own life twice.\n\nThat was this spring, if I'm not mistaken. My memory has been a mess ever since. I can't unmistakably remember a lot of things that was going on in the past four years - in fact, I've almost entirely forgotten a lot of people and private conversations that still pop up from time to time.\n\nSo, eventually, as my family has came to terms with the fact that I'm not going into the college ever again, proposing for me to enlist into the army instead, I've managed to somewhat recover both my mental and physical strength, as I've been actively working out this whole summer to get ready for the army.\n\nBut recently my habits began to break apart again. I've started to feel lazy, skipping my workout and daily chores. Everything returned to that all too familiar \"groundhog day\" feel. I'm afraid that I'm falling into depression yet again - and I have only a couple of weeks left until joining military. Is there anything I can do to bring back my motivation and avoid getting miserable in the worst time possible?"

I know that, to some extent, it is normal to have a few skipped beats on occasion, but this has become a frequent occurrence and the severity has increased. Following the initial skipped beat, my heart rate will sometimes increase and subsequently skip one or two more beats and will cause it to feel out of rhythm until I sit down or burp (I will get to this). When I feel it \"skip a beat\", it feels as if all of the air has been momentarily vacuumed from my chest, or almost like there is a hand that squeezes my heart really hard and then immediately lets go. I can almost feel my heart stopping for a split second, and then restarting. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Brief History:**\n\nWhen this first started happening roughly a year ago, it was after I began going to the gym regularly, and lifting heavy weight for the first time in my life (I was specifically doing heavy deadlifts - 300+ lbs as well as intense upper body workouts). At the time, I had health insurance through my job, so per my GP's advice, I went to the emergency room immediately after feeling my next skipped beat, and the issue did not reproduce in the hospital bed setting (as it rarely happens while I'm lying down). After a few ER visits, an echocardiogram, holter monitor, and tilt-table test, my cardiologist was not able to conclude what was causing this, and advised that I stop working out. I stopped all physical activity, gained a lot of weight, and the problem virtually went away (aside from maybe 1-2 episodes in a one month period)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Frequency and situation:**\n\nAt first, I was having maybe 1 episode per week, and now it is happening up to 5 times in a one week period. I also want to note that I started lifting again back in April of this year, and have lost a lot of weight and have gotten in a lot better shape. As I stated above, this happens mostly randomly, but recently has been more likely to occur while I am working out or moving in such a way to disturb something. For example, about 3 weeks ago, I had a pretty severe episode while running on the treadmill and was forced to stop running as my heart rhythm went way out of whack and skipped several beats until my heart rate decreased to a resting level. Another recent example is me jumping up into my friend's lifted truck and plopping down onto the seat, which caused about 4 or 5 skipped beats. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Potential Cause:(?)**\n\nAfter living with this issue for the past 12 months at least, and much research, my only theory as to what could be causing this is a hiatal hernia, or some kind of GI issue where gas/food gets temporarily lodged in such a way that causes my heart to transiently beat abnormally (maybe something putting pressure on vagus nerve). The reason I think this is that, in about 80% of episodes, I have either recently eaten and moved around too quickly after, or have had to burp following the episode. Though unlikely, I believe that the heavy lifting (specifically deadlifts) initially caused some kind of anatomical distress within my chest/abdomen. The problem is that this is causing me to not be able to work out. I no longer do deadlifts, but my strength and health is very important to me, and I do not want to be fat and sedentary again. I am desperately looking for answers, because this is extremely off putting and frightening when it happens. I don't want this to cause me to enter sudden cardiac arrest at such a young age. With that said, my question to you all is this: Are there ***any*** tests for something like this? It is hard for me to reproduce the skipped beats in front of a doctor, and when I last brought up this theory to my cardiologist, he laughed off the possibility of a lodged hernia or gas causing my heart to behave this way. Any and all input is so greatly appreciated. I have my notifications turned on for this post and will be available all day to immediately answer any follow up questions you have. Thanks again, and thank you for reading."

It felt like my shoulders were being drawn back at all times. With that came what felt like weakness and shakiness in my hands and arms (specifically, weakness running through my triceps, but not my biceps at all). Early on I also suffered from flu-like symptoms such as chills and sensitive skin. These have faded away, but the muscle tension has been constant for months now.

When symptoms didn\u2019t alleviate, I followed up with my physician, who was unconcerned and told me to keep hydrating and I\u2019d feel better. I continued to feel much worse and on a follow-up call to my physician a week later, he advised me to go to the ER. They ran blood tests and an EKG and all results were normal, so I was released and told to call a neurologist. I have been waiting to get into a neurologist since but my symptoms have continued to get worse.

        "reddit": "Hi,  I apologize in advance if this post is a little too long, but I want to  be thorough. This is my first ever post on reddit, so hoping for a good exchange. TLDR is at the bottom. Thanks in advance!  \n\nI have a severely addictive personality. I've had close run-ins with gambling, sex, alcohol, and weed. By some stroke of luck or innate sense of self-preservation, I did not get into cocaine, meth, heroine or any of that hard stuff. I also do tend to have a compulsive thought process with some severely debilitating intrusive thoughts playing on repeat in my head at times. However, today I'm writing to you about something a little more mundane but which is causing havoc in my life.\n\nI have been addicted to smoking for more than a decade now. Last year, I  finally managed to quit smoking with the help of Nicotine Replacement  Therapy (NRT).\n\nI had tried quitting before without the help of NRT, using methods like the one taught by Allen Carr, but it was a nightmare! I had severe bouts of rage and episodes of severe apathy, de-motivation, depression, and profound lethargy. My libido was affected too, which adds to the negative feedback loop. The longest I could survive was 2 months without  cigarettes, so it's not like I didn't give it enough time for my brain  to get used to the normal levels of dopamine and for the general  neurotransmitter balance to reset in my brain.  \n\nNow, after 1.5 years on NRT and a few relapses with cigarettes, I  finally want to quit all forms of nicotine for good. But I'm very very apprehensive to say the least.  \n\nMy major reason has already been stated: I get severely agitated and  experience bouts of pure rage when I'm off nicotine. I'm sad and a  little ashamed to say that I start pacing the room or punching the air  without realizing when under the influence of these mood swings. These  episodes start with severe, compulsive, intrusive thoughts that disturb  me in between any activity, whether it's reading or work or TV. The  intrusive thoughts are usually fantasies playing out in my mind  involving a verbal or physical confrontation with any person from my  life, even when I've had no such unpleasant experiences with them in the  past and have very little chances of such experiences in the future. It  is extremely disturbing. Doctors did mention that it could be a form of  OCD (they called this particular OCD form Pure-O) but the treatment includes SSRIs and I  can't handle them. When I'm not agitated, I'm depressed and demotivated  to do absolutely anything.  \n\nI do have a history of mental illness (I hate that term). I was  diagnosed with epilepsy as a young kid and spent many years taking  Tegretol and phenobarbital. I do not get seizures anymore, though. I  have also been diagnosed with depression and anxiety in the past. I  tried a few SSRIs but the sexual side effects were so negative for me  that I requested my doctor to take me off them. I am on Bupropion currently, both for depression and to help me quit smoking. I also take Lamotrigine for the benefit it provides as an anti-depressant in Bipolar  cases, and of course, the anti-convulsant property is a major bonus  too. I've heard that being put on anti-convulsants as a kid can make you reliant on them to maintain your mood as all anti-convulsants are mild mood stabilizers but I do not know how much weight that statement holds in the medical community.\n\nSo, having given such a lengthy essay on my background, I'd like to ask a few questions:\n\n1. if I should expect to have these mood swings and severe bouts of  agitation and depression all my life if I quit nicotine? What about my libido? Will that be affected? \n\n2. Is there a way I can overcome this that doesn't involve SSRIs? \n\n3. Has this anything to do with the Dopamine levels in my brain? Am I  naturally low on them? Or is it that I've gotten used to very high  levels of dopamine and now it will take ages for my brain to reset  itself? (I know questions pertaining to neurotransmitter levels are  tricky to answer as everyone has different baseline and it is hard to  accurately gauge levels of neurochemicals in the first place, but I  still wanted to ask this.)  \n\n4. My brain tries to rationalize my current addiction by saying Nicotine Lozenges and Vape is fine, it is not as harmful as cigarettes and nicotine is not a carcinogen. Would it make sense to continue with nicotine? (I take about 5-7 mg a day. I did get mouth ulcers on a few occasions due to the lozenges (no other dietary changes were made) and my vape causes a little lung irritation, but both problems are manageable.

Problems started I believe 5 days ago one morning when I woke up. I had noticed almost immediately that my right testis felt sore, but assumed I had just slept on it wrong and went about my day. Sore/dull/heavy feeling persisted but seemed to lessen day by day. As of today I hardly can notice it, only getting an occasional light discomfort feeling, and it\u2019s feeling better and better. 2 days prior to today though, I \u2018examined myself\u2019 and found a hard feeling bump about the size of a 1/4 of a pea. When I found it, it felt sore to the touch, but unnoticeable if I didn\u2019t touch it purposefully. Now it feels a very little bit sore when I directly touch it, again following the theme of feeling better over time. I\u2019ve researched a bit online for things it could be based off my symptoms, (which I have now learned is a terrible idea and doesn\u2019t mix well with severe anxiety), and it seems as though it\u2019s almost likely a type of cyst and rarely needs to be operated on or treated in any way. Of course there are still the possibilities of more harmful issues that it can be, such as cancer. \n \nI\u2019ve talked to my dad about the issues I\u2019ve had and he set up and appointment with the urologist he\u2019s gone to for a long time. That\u2019s in I think about a week, so there\u2019s that.

Location of complaint is in between my scrotum and anus, but internally, like two inches above my crotch.\n* Any existing relevant medical issues (if any): none. I don't smoke and drink socially every 1-2 weeks\n* Current medications (if any): none\n\nI have two issues that I think are somehow related. \n\nIssue one: Around one year ago, I started just feeling discomfort in an area of my body that I'm not exactly sure how to describe. It is the region in between my scrotum and anus, but two inches up, inside my body. It isn't pain, just discomfort. It comes and goes but has pretty much been there nonstop for a year, and I pretty much just forget it's there now. When it first happened, I went to the doctor, and they told me I probably just pulled a muscle and to come back in several months if it hadn't gotten better. Now, it is important to note that when this began (one year ago), I had not once had a single sexual experience with anyone, not even kissed somebody, so I don't think it could be an STD.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIssue two: I didn't really think these issues were related until recently (will explain next paragraph.) Occasionally, while masturbating or with somebody else, I will climax and semen will come out, but around 20 minutes later my urethra will burn and I feel the need to urinate. I will urinate a small amount like 5 times in the next 30 minutes and the burning gradually subsides. This also began probably around a year ago? But I'm not sure.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, several days ago I was with somebody and things escalated and they starting giving me oral sex, but we abruptly had to stop and I had to go home (and I didn't reach orgasm.) I fell asleep right after that, and the entire next day I had to work and I realized my testicles kind of hurt. I looked it up and figured I had epididymal hypertension/blue balls and so when I got home that evening I masturbated. When I reached orgasm, though, there was several seconds delay (I felt it, then three to four seconds later, semen came out, instead of immediately). I actually fell asleep right after that, but I woke up twenty or thirty minutes later with severe burning. I also had to urinate, and when I did, the urine was very cloudy, and the burning got worse. I took a shower and eventually the burning subsided, but ever since then the \"uncomfortable\" feeling I described earlier has been much much stronger. It still doesn't hurt, but it just feels like something is wrong.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I really don't know what the issue is-do I have retrograde ejaculations sometimes? Is that my issue? Do I have an issue with my prostate? Some sort of infection? Is the discomfort related to the occasional burning in my urethra? Should I see a doctor? Any help would be appreciated and I will gladly answer any questions"

I take Lexapro 10 mgs for mild depression and Lisinopril 20 mgs for high blood pressure daily. I have never taken any medication for herpes because I am thinking at the time of my diagnosis there weren't any on the market..anyways my Dr never offered them to me and I never went back in for any kind of treatment after the initial diagnosis. So therefore I have had many recurances or flare ups over the years..although as in most cases they have become less frequent and milder outbreaks. I have never had a fever blister but I was diagnosed with a herpatic Whitlow on my right index finger around  the same time I was diagnosed with genital..it has not flared up since 1987. I have been married for 36 years and my husband has not contracted herpes or shown any symptoms. I also was diagnosed with vaginal dryness after menopause which caused severe itching but not like the herpes itch..not painful..and was prescribed estrogen cream to apply every 3 to 4 days externally and this took care of the problem. My concern now is in the last 3 weeks I have had a large swelling on my right outer labia that itched but didn't have the pain I usually associate with the herpes. After several days of treating with the estrogen cream 2 very large, very painful ulcers developed full of pus that opened and drained and do not seem to be healing very fast. Also approximately 6 more nodules have appeared in this lump and they too are ulcerating but not as bad as the first 2 ulcers. Also on my left buttock a very large boil like area came up and is the most painful of all..to the point of impeding my daily activities. What could have caused this horrible outbreak this late in the game? I have always been able to handle my outbreaks but this has been more than pain level can endure. Would going on the typical herpes antiviral medications help me now? Or is 40 years after contracting the disease too late to start? I always heard that you need to start the medication in the initial outbreak. I have been diagnosed but my MD never suggested any medication at the time and I have never complained since and I feel like they may have forgotten I was ever diagnosed and it would be embarrassing to bring it up now!

When i first started feeling out of it in january i got lab work done which all came back normal, but i didnt have the stretch marks at the time.

I have also cut out fast food, work out 2 to 3 times a week and started eating a little better (lost 10lbs in the past 3 months).

Please tell me if there's some other Reddit where people with female organs talk about how to fix said organs to be less annoying.\n\nAnyway, I'm fucking depressed. Why? Hell if I know, but it's way worse during the \"follicular phase.\" That's the one between funny blood time and release egg. Actually, release egg time is where I somehow feel worse. My libido spikes, but I'm so unaroused and can't even get my pitiful small genitalia to do anything due to my depression, so I just sit on my bed and die. I can't even jerk off during this time. Maybe a few days after my period. But a week after? Fuckin nahh. So much for \"OVULATION IS THE BEST, ISNT IT, KAREN.\"\n\nLuteal phase starts, suddenly everything is cool and good! Great. Jerk off all the time and have great enjoyment doing things, very productive at work, do not want to die. I don't feel horribly dissociated with myself, or that I'm living some kind of terrible simulation in which things aren't actually happening to me. Wonderful! Then, when blood is about to spill, like, for two days I'm like \"whoa I feel wacky lmao\" and then that lasts for another day or two while I bleed out, then good. Until a few days later. Then we've gone full circle back into the fucking follicular piece of shit, and the useless egg that I will lay decides to develop or something. Sad!\n\nAnyway, I'm really annoyed I can't find anything on people feeling bad after their periods, or completely lacking a libido until what they call \"not good time of month.\" Total bullshit btw, shark week isn't real. But really, actually, it's frustrating, you know, I have a girlfriend. And I can't even get up for her most of the time because of this stupid fucking organ. I just want to know what I can do. Something is obviously extremely wrong with my hormones, but I don't have health insurance. (Yeah sucks right.) I can buy progesterone/estrogen cream off the internet, but idk which one I'd even need, or when I'd need it. Are there horomone test kits I can buy? Can I do anything?\n\nTL;DR: I feel dissociated and sad with zero libido from period to ovulation. I feel best after ovulation until my period. I don't know what's wrong.\n\nSomeone please help, at least redirect me to a subreddit that cares or somethin'."

By this point I'd googled exercised to strengthen knee for jumpers knee and had been doing this for month with no luck. I managed to get assessed on the phone and luckily there was a cancellation and got seen next day, physio did x-ray which came back fine &amp; gave stretches to increase quads &amp; hip flexors strength (squats, side leg raises, side steps with resistance bands etc) and identified patella alta, I did this for a few months and come April was doing better, I was still not playing but felt ok, I asked the physio if was ok to play a match or two (if we won those we'd win the league) he said it'd be ok and I wouldn't cause anymore damage so played the first match with prematch massage, strapped up, deep heat and throughly warmed up and I was absolutely fine after so I played it again in the vital last game, same setup beforehand but just didn't feel right after, I did fall on my knee that game but I've had worse when I've played. \n\nFollowing this my knee was progressively getting worse, I saw the physio again, who did an ultrasound on the knee to check and all he said was that at one end of the tendon was widening where it was trying to repair itself but not doing that good of a job, carry on with stretches but do not go above 3/10 pain threshold, this meant I wasn't fast forward to beginning of July, I now struggle to walk my dog, I can't jog, kneel, lift anything remotely heavy - I can't do anything without being in pain even sitting at work at desk bothers my knee so physio referred me to orthopaedics and orthotics (I have had custom insoles since I was 5 due to fallen arches, physio believed this had no impact on knee but I'm adament there is some relation so asked for the referral) \n\nThe referral for orthotics took 1 day to be processed, appointment booked for September. The referral for orthopaedics has still not been processed and it has 4 weeks today, I've called 5 times and been told I'd be called back twice but that hasn't happened, I've also tried calling the complaints line but only went to voicemail, I am so desperate to get help but I am at a loss at what I can do, NHS waiting lists are up to 18 weeks but having checked today my hospital currently 9/10 patients are being seen within 32 weeks! \n\nI'm in pain everyday, all I can do is walk and after a short period this is painful, I miss exercise so much, it used to help with my depression so much and now I'm low alot of the time as I feel so stuck and can't do anything about the pain, private is not an option due to price and I don't have insurance so it's just the NHS. \n\nTL;DR progressive knee pain resulting in going from very very active to basically inactive, don't seem to be getting anywhere with NHS, may have to wait up to 8 months, can't afford private.

He started getting horrible chills and alternates between being hot and very cold, literally shaking under his quilt while I wear shorts. Appetite dwindled even more and the chest pain got more serious. Early hours of the morning he threw up what little he had to eat that day. More chills but no apparent fever. Also, must note, he does not have a stuffy nose like you'd expect from flu. Also he was not coughing at all until Sunday when he got a dry cough that seems to be getting worse.\n\nI plan to take him to the doctor this morning but I am very scared.

The allergist then started me on symbicort twice daily, singulair, and ventolin as needed. We have since tweaked it and added mucinex D. But still, this lingers.

Daily/Bi Daily, not large quantities tho.\n\nSo a number of years ago this started, no idea where it came from, always wore a condom for sex so I can only assume it was from oral sex or a broken condom.  Anyway, it got bad, to the point where I had small to medium warts all around my foreskin (dozens).  I was embarrassed and read it might go away on it's own so I didn't go to the doctor for a long time, tried things like ACV with no success.\n\nFinally I gather the courage to go to the walk in (roughly 3 years ago now) and was prescribed Condyline, which actually worked for most of them which was promising.  On a few (6-8 or so) it had basically no effect tho.  I went back and was prescribed podofilm.  This was ineffective, terrible to apply (don't think it ever dries?) and basically all it did was upset my stomach somehow.  Tried Condyline again and still no luck.  Every time I'd go to the doctor he seemed to know less about HPV than I did from scouring the internet for information (Side note: The amount of information out there FOR MEN regarding HPV is pathetic, and sifting through all the bullshit home remedies is a nightmare).  So finally he gives me TCA to apply myself.  This worked to a degree, but also left behind de-pigmented spots/scars in a couple of spots, and is WAY too gnarly to try applying to the smaller ones.  I'd say there are about 4 or 5 very small ones left, and some other questionable spots.\n\nI have an appointment with a \"specialist\" aka urologist at the end of fucking October (this got scheduled in like....May...FFS), but I can't wait that long again, nor do I think a urologist is the right specialist for a fucking skin issue.  I expressed this to the doctor and still.... I don't get an appointment till like 6 months later.  Pathetic.\n\nSo now I don't know what to do.  I'm going to try Condyline once again I think since I have a refill, combined with Compound W gel.  The only thing I haven't really tried prescription wise is Aldara, which I have a prescription for but it's also very expensive, and no guarantee it will work, and takes a loooong time to work.  Freezing was mentioned as an option but also might leave more scars.  I don't have any patience left and don't want to mutilate my dick any further.  This has all taken an immense emotional toll on me resulting in depression and anxiety, including a bad panic attack in recent months.  I feel robbed of many of what should have been my best years, and my confidence.  I haven't been with a woman in years now and it's soul crushing and lonely.  I feel like this will just never end, and that now I'll always have these fucking scars too.  Some of the ones that appear gone I still get an itch there and worry they are gonna come back too.\n\nSo...what can I do here?  I feel so stuck and alone with this.  I know quitting smoking and being healthier would help...and I want to do that....but the stress and depression from this makes it way more difficult than it is otherwise.  Is there another type of specialist I should be trying to get an appointment with?  Is there anyone that actually gives a shit and won't just push me out of their office as quick as possible?  The medical community in this region seems to be beyond awful, even for other random infections and issues, never once have I been prescribed something that actually worked first try, always have to go back and get a second prescription.\n\nIs a circumcision/partial circumcision a good option (and what is the difference)?  At this point every little bump freaks me out, and I don't think I can ever feel comfortable that they're all gone even if it appears that way.  Basically all of them have been located on the foreskin no more than roughly 2cm down.  I'm afraid that this would cause a crazy scar or in some other way be regrettable, not to mention expensive as fuck for me.  I actually liked having a foreskin for the most part, looks aside, but I hate it now and am at that point where I just want this to be over by any means necessary.  I want a real life again, which I haven't had for years now.\n\nAny suggestions for ways to combat the scars/de-pigmentation?\n\nSorry for the long description, just want to get it all out and try to describe what's been going on.

The problem is sleep related in the form of me needing TO MUCH sleep rather to getting not enough. On average I get 10-12 hours a night when an alarm is not set. I wakeup around 8am for work and go to bed around 11-12pm (so 7 - 9 hours of sleep depending on when I go to bed). The issue I'm having is when I wake up I feel like I was ran over by a cement roller and 20 busses EVEN after coffee. \n\nI've done all the life-hacks online to no avail:\n\n* No caffine after Noon\n* Move Alarm clock away from bed (no snooze)\n* Use light alarm (I just slept right threw it)\n* Use blue light filter at night\n* Maintain a sleep schedule \n* Etc\n\nThe most confusing part however, is if I turn off my alarm (on weekend for example) and sleep in. You would think I would feel refreshed but the result is a feeling WORSE than when I woke up on the alarm. I wake up still tired after 10-12 hours of sleep (so like 10am - noon if I go to bed at midnight) but I have a horrible headache that will persist throughout the day. Also, even after getting an abnormal amount of sleep, I can still go back to sleep or take a nap for a couple more hours if I want to. The only thing that prevents me is the scorching pain in my head forcing me to get up. \n\nThe only thing I want is to be able to go to be at 11-12 and wake up on my own at 8-9. (8 hours of sleep is normal) and not feel like I was drugged the night before. \n\nSpeaking of drugs, I have tourettes and OCD. Therefore, I've pretty much been on every neurology medication out there because as soon as one gave me bad side effects we switched to another. That's one reason I think the medications messed up my brain somehow because I've been on ALL of them even the experiemental ones.\n\nThe ones I remember off the top of my head:\n\n* Risperdal\n* Haldol\n* guanfacine \n* Seroquil\n* Volume \n* Prozac \n* More (I was on the one that had the commercial recall for female breast development although that was along time ago)\n\n\nRight now I'm on Tropimate (topimax) [50 mg every night] which works really well and doesn't have too much side effects.\n\nI've went to the doctor and got two blood tests to tests for imbalances but they both returned normal.

I became extremely congested and had cold-like symptoms, I then proceeded with a cold crash course treatment and the cold/congestion I had was gone within a couple days. However, a few things remained. A pretty bad headache - it was a tension type headache that caused awful pain in the temporal muscle, as well as post nasal drip. Since then, these two things have been consistent, 24/7. I still have the constant PND mucus and 24/7 headache that now gets triggered into migraines. With this, I also sleep on average 15+ hours a day. I just awoke from a 30 hour straight sleep and feel awful. The only time that I can actually be awake during the day is if I wake up at 8 pm on an evening, stay up through the night and stay up through the day - I of course can't do this sustainably and decide not to as it could make issues worse. I have seen a General Practitioner, he is clueless and was referred to a numerologist around Jan of 2019. Was prescribed pretty much everything under the radar, including, Effexor, beta blockers, lamictal, gabapentin, muscle relaxers, calcium channel blockers, DHE 45 in injection and suppositories, steroids, every kind of OTC pain medication, nasal sprays, I've also had two rounds of botox, without much success. At this point, I can handle the headaches, but I can't handle this sleep problem! It started occurring around the same time in November, when this all happened and I'm constantly fatigued during the day. I already take stimulants, which we have ruled out to be an issue - but this has no impact on my sleep or daytime fatigue. I eat healthy, as well as exercising as much as physically possible. I'm a 20 year old male, 6'1 and weigh 170 lbs. I've gotten my Thyroid checked, as I had hypothyroidism as a kid, but my levels are beautiful. Have had pretty much everything else checked, including hormone levels and a total blood count. Only abnormality was VERY SLIGHTLY elevated corisol levels. I went to see an ENT in march for a sleep study and they found very mild sleep apnea with an AHI of 10, but there's no way in hell that an AHI that slightly elevated could cause this mass of problems. I'm at pretty much demise here, I've tried I feel everything that I can possibly do and nothing is helping and it's completely ruined my ability to maintain a social life, as well as having a job and being able to go to school.\n\nAnyone have any ideas of where I should look or what tests could be helpful?\n\nThanks!"

I've also had multiple investigations for crohn's, etc. and everything's come up ok over the years apart from the endometriosis. I just manage pain and expect to feel ill a few days out of the month (I get weird periods of weakness / electrolyte imbalances etc). I'm pretty reluctant to see doctors these days after so many negative tests. \n\nOnto now: On Thursday I had a few intense stabbing pains around my navel. Like a hot skewer being stabbed in that area. They came as quick as they went but the pain was intense, at least a 7/10. I googled it and sort of made a mental note about the pain moving downwards and forgot about it. I've had occasional stomach pains plenty of times before, although not really like this. \n\nI've also had bad neck strain over the last week which I've put down to a bad desk chair setup at work. So, over the weekend I've been taking ibuprofen for that. \nOver the weekend I occasionally noticed abdominal pain but didn't think anything of it, I often get that sort of pain around PMS time. The only way I can describe it is imagining my insides stuck together (thanks endometriosis!) and if I move too suddenly there are little sharp bits of pain. \n\nOn Monday I stayed off work because I felt generally a bit nauseous and weak. I haven't thrown up at all. \n\nCut to about 4am last night and I get woken by what seems like bad gas pains, and while lying there wishing for it to go away it dawns on me that I made a mental note to keep an eye out for appendicitis. Well the pain is coming from the lower right side, and it hurts much more when I try to move. I panicked a little bit, thought about going to hospital, but once I got up and walked around a little it didn't seem intense enough. I didn't have a fever, but did feel shaky and clammy (could have been anxiety), I also tried the \"dropping onto heels\" test from youtube and it didn't seem to hurt like they say it should online. \n\nSo I managed to get back to sleep after that. This morning, passing gas and having a bowel movement was incredible painful, with sharp, shooting pains in my rectum. The lower right pain is still coming and going but doesn't seem so bad. \n\nI was going to go to the doctor but decided I was maybe overreacting and went to work instead. I haven't been myself but I got through the day, and the pain wasn't bad at all, but there's still something going on there. I've got stabbing pains more in my stomach area and it gets very sting-ey when I eat. I'm flip flopping between not wanting to go because I'm not doubled over in pain and it will just be another episode of nothing (or maybe a burst ovarian cyst coming and going), versus \"appendicitis can be fatal\" and getting looked at right away. \n\nThanks if you managed to read through all that. Any tips?"

They weren't physically weak in the sense of trembling/having to rest, just the feeling itself. In the days since it started up I experienced tingling in the feet and calves, and went to a walk-in again to see what was up. The doctor didn't seem immediately concerned it was MS after performing some reflex tests and ordered blood work to check for electrolytes assuming I might be deficient from whatever stomach bug I might have had.

After performing a bunch of blood tests and physical examination the doctor wasn't immediately concerned it was Guillain-Barr\u00e9 Syndrome or MS and appeared confident it would go away on its own. She suspected that whatever was affecting my gut might have just thrown things off across the board but mentioned if things persisted or got notably worse to come back. Today it is a bit better but it fluctuates.\n\nI'm seeing my GP tomorrow and was wondering what might be good things to inquire into/how to advocate for myself. Admittedly having not yet spoken to a neurologist or had anything besides blood work and reflex tests done my head keeps going to to the worst case outcomes of MS or cancers, and my anxiety is extremely high.

He did test for thyroid issues and everything was normal. Blood sugars are very stable  / well-controlled because he's still in the \"honeymoon\" phase where his body is still producing some insulin. \n* Gastro told him to cut out coffee and prescribed some medications to help with heartburn and stomach problems and see how it goes (it helped but still some pain/discomfort).

Dr basically said this was weird and to retest it again in a few weeks to see if it's still elevated.\n2. Slightly positive for Lyme. Dr said you have to test positive 2x in a row to have Lyme so he said to consider this a negative overall since the first one was negative.

I'm a 24 yr old male, and I have Type 1 Diabetes. Last friday, I woke up and felt like I had been hit by a truck. I ached head to toe, had a temperature of 102, very mild stomach pain and nausea, full body chills to the point I was shivering and shaking, and an absolutely pounding headache. Went to work for 4 hours, couldn't do it anymore and went to the doctor. \n\n\n\nAt the doctor I was told I had a type of flu. I was given the flu test and it came back negative, however the doctor was sure that I had some type of flu. I was given a cough syrup with codeine to help the pain from the aches. Saturday I felt like I had done a 180. Throat was a bit sore, very tired, temp was in mid 99s, but other than that I felt fine.\n \n\n\nSunday was better yet, fever had broke, the only thing was i had a few mild bouts of dizziness every once in a while. Started eating again and went to work on monday. Worked a full 10 hour day in construction, came home, ate dinner, felt fine. No fever. About an hour after dinner I started to get a headache again, and my stomach felt funny. I laid on the couch for a while and went to bed. \n\n\n\nFlash forward to 2 am this morning. Woke up, stomach is turning circles. Extremely dizzy, can't walk more than a few feet without having to stop because I'm about to throw up or fall over. Sat in front of the toilet, and do some pretty violent dry heaving, but nothing would come out. Extreme dizziness continued, slept on the bathroom floor. \n\n\nSlept till about 10 this morning. I still have some dizziness and nausea, and my stomach is painful and cramped up. It feels like I'm going to have diarrhea some point as well. I keep getting an acid type heartburn feeling at the bottom of my throat, and I keep burping. My fever is back as well, my temp is reading as 100. \n\n\nAnybody know what this could be? Is it the same virus I had over the weekend? Flu turned into stomach flu? Food poisoning? I just want an idea of what this is and what I can do to feel better, I just want to be back to normal and feel okay again."

Had allergies combined with upper respiratory (viral, not flu) earlier this year, although a few sets of antibiotics actually did help me a lot...but whatever I got, kept coming back as the antibiotics seem to wipe out about 90% of what I had, but some latency remained.\n\nAbout 2 months ago, all symptoms stopped for about 3 weeks.  Then they started again.\n\nStarted getting a nagging cough, along with occasional mild fevers at night.  Cough so bad frequently that hard to catch my breath.\n\nCongestion/tightness in chest started developing slowly, but gradually, a few weeks ago.  Started getting tighter and tighter.  By this time, I had had a PFT test, an X-ray (showed some inflammation), and a CT scan.  At the time, I had almost all the signs of pneumonia but the docs would not give me anything until the CT scan came through in about 2 weeks and despite the fact that I asked them should I wait until I collapse, pass out, die, or go into the ER to get a prescription.  I obtained (through valid prescription) Levaquin from a doctor friend of mine (I'm aware of the black box warning) and it worked GREAT - congestion / tightness gone in 2 days.  Took a 10 day course of this drug; I had many of the more minor symptoms but I needed to get rid of what I suspected to be pneumonia (I had walking pneumonia 3 times as a young kid).\n\nThe PFT test showed that I was experiencing a restrictive lung disease.\n\nNow, I still have a cough, but it's much more of a dry, scratchy cough - like an allergy-related cough, without phlem and without tightness, but still sometimes causes me to lose my breath and get a bit dizzy.  I'm thinking I do have GERD and it's causing the condition up in the title.  And not sure if this is related - bronchial spasms come and go.  \n\nWhat type of doctor do I go to for this?  Not too happy with my pulmonologist - do I go to an ENT instead?\n\nAnd in the meantime, I've seen some sites suggesting taking Prisolec during the day 2-3 times and then Zantac at night because apparently Prisolec works better in the day and Zantac (as a treatment, if in fact I do have GERD).\n\nAny thoughts as to if my thinking is right, or if I might have something else?\n\nAlso, I never have coughed up blood in this whole time as well, so I doubt it's anything cancer related - although I am going back in on 8/20/19 as a follow-up with the results of my CT scan."

Abdomen, pelvis, chest, hips, no drugs or medication, non-smoker. \n\nHi.\n\nTo start I plan on seeing a doctor ASAP - just looking for opinions, thoughts, etc. \n\nTLDR : I\u2019ve had symptoms similar to ovarian all my life. When should I get worried? Especially when some pre-existing conditions have been around most of my life? \n\nI had a recent flare-up of anxiety after starting and stopping Prozac and Concerta - I had a level 9 panic attack and went to the hospital with anxiety, vision problems, nausea, frequent needs to pee, weakness, hallucinations, ticking, etc. Ive been off of the medication for two weeks after some bad withdrawal but my anxiety is still through the roof most days, more so than usual. With that came a myriad of stomach problems, predominantly nausea and refusing to eat, followed by a few days of constipation, then diarrhea, then constipation again, etc. \n\nBackstory. \n\nI have a long history of anxiety disorders AND stomach disorders. I strongly suspect IBS and/or GERD. I am almost constantly constipated and battling bloating. I know that my anxiety can make either issue act up. Especially since the anxiety flareup I\u2019ve passed some mucous in my stools. That\u2019s when I know the anxiety is REALLY bad - and it has been. I finally had a panic attack bad enough to send me to the hospital, which lead to me immediately dropping the SSRI. \n\nI also suspect I may have Endometriosis, or else just very bad periods. They are about 21ish days apart (I\u2019m currently on day 26...hmm) and very heavy and painful. I get flu-like symptoms like nausea, chills and diarrhea. Not fun. I\u2019ve never experienced irregular bleeding between periods or found bloody stools or anything. I DO have pain during vaginal penetration or intercourse, but I\u2019ve always been like that, literally for most of my life. I don\u2019t have vaginal sex with my husband for that reason alone, in spite of also being asexual. I sometimes experience bad pains in my pelvis or on either side of my hips between periods - I assume when I\u2019m ovulating. They feel a bit like dull or sometimes Sharp gas pains. They linger for a day or two and then disappear. \n\nRecently I started getting reflux, which is new for me. I believe it is anxiety related. It has also been affecting my breathing a bit - I feel short of breath, which startled me, and have been experiencing mild chest flutters and palpitations. Very frightening when you have a panic disorder and I think being anxious of this has made things worse. But it was the onset of shortness of breath, chest heaviness, and feeling My heart do weird stuff  that got me extra worried about ovarian cancer. \n\nI plan to talk to my doc as soon as I can make an appointment - likely tomorrow. \n\nI\u2019m just lost and anxious. As usual I guess, but still. The symptoms of IBS and Ovarian Cancer are SO similar, and I\u2019ve been having these problems for years. I really just want to hear that I\u2019m safe to assume my increased anxiety is making all of my usual life-long symptoms flare up. \n\nWhat should I request to rule out one or the other? Should I even BE worried if I\u2019ve had all of these symptoms for so long? The only new thing is that when I\u2019m extra anxious, I tend to pee a lot. I will be sitting in the bathroom, pee a little, wait five minutes if I\u2019m constipated, and then suddenly pee a little more. I usually pee once or twice a day, but lately, while anxious, I have had these little bouts of urination.\n\nAny suggestions would be SUPER appreciated!!!"

I figured it was just bronchitis and when my host family took me to the doctor she confirmed that. I am probably just being paranoid because I have a fear of germs, hospitals, and medication side effects but I know that in America I would never be prescribed any of these for bronchitis. I also know that antibiotics and steroids (what I am on) can be super dangerous so I am just pretty worried right now. It also doesn't help that I'm in a foreign country for the first time. So I was basically just wondering if anybody could ease my concerns and explain why I am on these medications/wether or not I should be concerned. I already plan on calling my doctor in America to discuss with her when her office is open tomorrow. Also when I went into the doctor's appointment in Brasil all she did was ask me my symptoms and then listen to me breathe on the stethoscope for a minute. Nothing else was done, (measurements, tests), so that freaks me out even more. I've also never been on any medications as strong as these. One last thing, my face has been really puffy and kind of sore which might just be from me being sick, crying, the heat here, or the medications. It has definitely been adding to my anxiety just because I have struggled with anorexia in the past so feeling bloated like this is really spiking my anxiety.

So you can imagine getting my blood pressure taken at a doctors office is a bit of a nightmare.\n\nI have my own blood pressure monitor at home because I thought it might be easier. To give you an idea of the level of anxiety I get...my resting heart rate is around 60-65. As soon as the blood pressure cuff goes on my arm my heart rate goes from 60 to 120. No matter what I do I don't seem to be able to relax for the blood pressure test. The lowest reading I've had was around 150/90 with a heart rate of 110+. In the doctors office is significantly higher. \n\nThis leads to blood pressure medication for me, a low dose of perindopril (ace inhibitor). However, even this isn't helping. I can't help but feel like my blood pressure isn't nearly as high as the tests show though. I just don't know what to do to relax for the test, nothing works.

I'm 34 and have ED from cycling, then made even worse by rock climbing (harness impinged on perineal nerve in back). This happened around 5 years ago, immediately following my first 100 mile bike ride, and has not improved. Around that time, I ended up seeing this urologist in San Diego: [http://www.sandiegosexualmedicine.com](http://www.sandiegosexualmedicine.com/), the Dr there specializes in cycling-related ED. They ran a ton of tests, ultrasound etc., and found that the circulation to my dick was reduced and that there was significant loss in sensation (like I could barely feel temperature differences). The main treatment they spoke of was a blood vessel grafting, replacing the damaged one with another from my thigh I think. The success rate was something like 70%, but this wouldn't restore sensation since the nerves wouldn't be affected.\n\nViagra helps a bit, but since it got worse last November following a climbing trip, I'm no longer sure it's enough. I haven't had sex with a girl since before then so I'm not really sure. But it's even harder to get an erection, and the numbness has increased markedly.\n\nThis is a very specific injury, and I was hoping that maybe someone out there has read some obscure paper involving other possible treatments, or know of another doctor that has worked with these injuries in the Seattle area (I no longer live in San Diego). I'm willing to spend quite a bit on this (cash since insurance covered none of this, my visit to SDSM was $2k alone), it's just I don't even know what's out there because it's so uncommon. Can they even repair nerves damaged like this? If anyone can shed light on possible steps forward, I'd be so grateful."

        "reddit": "Hi all,\n\nMy dad (64M, 5\u201910\u201d, 230lbs) suffered a massive heart attack about five weeks ago and an anoxic brain injury as a result. He had no prior health problems with the exception of high blood pressure which he has had for many years and a genetic form of muscular dystrophy he has had his whole life known as Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT).\n\nBased on the amount of time he went without oxygen (likely 20 mins), the chances of meaningful recovery were slim. However, we made the decision to intubate him because he was meeting all the neurological checks he should be and really because the problem with CMT is that it makes you HIGHLY sensitive to sedatives, paralytics, and the like. So, we just had to give him more time to come out of it.\n\nHe seemed to be doing well at first. He could sometimes respond to commands and answer questions and make decisions by wiggling his feet. He is in there. He looks at us and responds emotionally in the ways he should. I won\u2019t go into more detail, but let\u2019s just say he is in there in some capacities at least but he can\u2019t regain control of his body and things are just inconsistent.\n\nHe was doing well on the ventilator weaning but everything just kind of went to hell at once. About two weeks after incident he started having seizures. Then about a week ago he spiked a high fever and vomited. Things just kind of stagnated and now here we are: taking hospice measures. We are on a waiting list to go to the hospice facility nearby, but they have begun hospice measures at the specialty hospital where we currently are.\n\nThey have removed the feeding tube down his nose. He is not getting fluids or feeding. Only oxygen through his tracheal tube and Ativan as needed for anxiety. I think that\u2019s it.\n\nTLDR: I\u2019m looking for someone to explain what\u2019s going on to me without platitudes. I\u2019m tired of them and I don\u2019t need to be sheltered - I need to be informed. I feel like I can\u2019t ask these questions around my family b/c they are too emotional right now. \n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t experience hunger like we do.\u201d I feel like that\u2019s bull b/c I\u2019m just sitting here listening to my Dad\u2019s stomach growl and thinking about how they say lobsters don\u2019t feel pain when you boil them and how that\u2019s probably bull too.\n\nIs my dad thirsting and starving to death?"

However, I often find myself having associated chest pains, specifically around my sternum, which my physical therapist finds unusual. On occasion this pain eventually leads to nausea and vomiting. The best guess is that it\u2019s a digestive issue, which my primary care doctor seems to agree with thus far, but I also haven\u2019t found a way to combat it effectively. The doctor has recommended medications to try (namely Zantac, as weaker antacids don\u2019t seem to have any effect), but that doesn\u2019t seem to help either. There\u2019s another medication she recommended that\u2019s even stronger and to be taken before meals, but I don\u2019t offhand recall the name of it (though I could look it up as I have it saved in a note), and I also expressed concern that most doses would go to waste as this doesn\u2019t typically strike me during most meals and can be hard to predict.\n\nI did at one point have a sharper pain and vomiting episode several months back, which was chalked up to pill esophagitis at the urgent care, and within the past month or so I had a screening of my esophagus (I forget the name\u2014the one where you swallow barium and are xrayed), but the results from that came back looking totally normal.\n\nI\u2019ve tried to see if it might be certain foods that are setting it off, but there\u2019s no consistency to it. I can eat something spicy one day and be fine, and then eat something way more mild later in the week and spend the rest of the night in pain. Often I would turn to having simple chicken soups when feeling unwell as to not bring on a vomiting episode, but then I\u2019ve also had this come on following a bowl of chicken soup. It feels as though the only way to avoid the chest pains is to just not eat, which obviously isn\u2019t feasible, especially when I can\u2019t predict these episodes in advance. When it comes to the back pain (which is more common than the chest pain), often the only things that help are heat or cold, applied for long periods, and the pain returns as soon as I\u2019m not in contact with the heat/cold source. Usually the episodes last for the remainder of the day once they start, but sometimes they continue into the next day.\n\nI\u2019m really hoping someone might be able to help me out in any way whatsoever. At this very moment I\u2019m suffering through another episode and regretting even eating anything today, and am planning to have only liquids tomorrow."

        "reddit": "Gender: female. Age: 18. Race: Caucasian. Weight: 125 lbs. Height: 5 ft 5 inches. Other: Cystic Fibrosis, Pulmonary Atresia. \n\nAbout an hour ago, I was hit with a massive anxiety attack while I was sitting up in bed playing video games on my laptop. I\u2019ve been really stressed out this week due to some major, sudden changes in my personal life, so I\u2019ve been having daily panic attacks. I\u2019m in therapy and have tried various medications, but nothing really works. The anxiety is all situational.\n\nAnyway, in bed, I had my back pressed up against the headboard, I was kinda slouched over, and my laptop was resting on my knees (I had my legs bent). Whenever I get an anxiety attack, it starts with a racing/fluttering heart, then my airways constrict, my rational thoughts are replaced with end-of-the-world scenarios, my palms get sweaty, and I have to get up and move around. Well, as soon as I stood up, I felt something get pushed up in front of my left rib cage. It didn\u2019t hurt, it didn\u2019t further restrict my breathing, when I pressed on it and then rubbed it, it still didn\u2019t hurt, and even when I stretched to help with my breathing, there was no pain. It just feels like a bit of pressure that\u2019s barely noticeable. \n\nI ran upstairs to the bathroom and lifted up my shirt. Sure enough, my left side towards the lower ribcage was/is swollen. It isn\u2019t a very high swelling, there are no bumps or bruises. It just looks like an ab muscle. Except, my ab was definitely swollen. Not to epic proportions, but enough so it looks out of place. Due to the open heart surgery I had as a newborn, I have a few extra dimples in the center of my chest, which helps make my abs on my fatless body look even more pronounced. \n\nPanicked and crying, I showed my mom. She wasn\u2019t concerned about my abs, but agreed to help me facetime my aunt and my grandma (both RNs who work in an ER and a nursery with moms who sometimes have sprained/bulging muscles from giving birth). I described to them exactly what happened and how I was feeling. I even showed them my swelling on facetime. I was breathing very heavily and shaking due to anxiety. Both my aunt and grandma told me it wasn\u2019t a hernia. Diaphragm hernias are mostly genetic and are caught at birth, or are otherwise caused by severe, traumatic injuries, which I\u2019ve never had. Spleen hernias are usually crippling, and even they don\u2019t hurt, they\u2019ll come with bruising and other symptoms which I do not have. \n\nI couldn\u2019t control my breathing yet when I had my aunt on the phone, but managed to regain control of my breathing and calm down with my grandma on the line. The swelling was still very apparent, but no pain. My grandma then asked if I\u2019d eaten a lot today, and I haven\u2019t. My anxiety gets in the way of my meals, so I\u2019ve only eaten a small sandwich and a handful of grapes today. She told me I looked bloated in the call, and just a few minutes later, I burped, relieving some of the pressure. I guess I swallow air when I get anxious. I can still feel the air moving around inside me as it leaves.\n\nSo, 10 minutes later to now, I\u2019m almost completely calm. My breathing/heart rate are normal. I\u2019m slowly but surely relieving some of the air. But my left side is still swollen, but there\u2019s no pain. The muscle (or whatever the bulge is), feels squishy and relaxed, like fat. Like I said, I have almost no fat on my body, but is it possible some sneaked through while I was having a panic attack? But it\u2019s even, not lumpy, so it must be an ab. Did I just irritate my ab? Is there some fat deposit I didn\u2019t know I had. Am I overreacting? I\u2019m one tiny pain away from calling an ambulance, but the only thing that hurts right now is my stomach because I\u2019m really hungry (I\u2019ve got some burgers on the grill, and am steaming some veggies). \n\nI\u2019m worried my ab (or whatever it is) will move somewhere else it isn\u2019t supposed to and cause pain or restrict my lung left lung. Like I said, I can breathe just fine, my heart is slowed down, I can move my body anywhere (bending down, stretching towards the sky, twisting side-to-side, laying on my back, laying on my right side, laying on my left side, laying on my belly). It just feels weird when I\u2019m laying on my left side or on my belly or slouching forward. No pain, no difficulty breathing, no tightness, just like a small bit of pressure. \n\nAlso, I\u2019m all full of gas, and can feel other muscles in my belly working to push it out. \n\nI\u2019ll be up for most of the night and checking this regularly. I\u2019ll update as time goes on."

I went to the doctor about my mental health issues around 5 years ago after feeling suicidal. For me this was not the beginning of my issues, more the kind of \"breaking point\" after years of struggling. Prior to this, I can remember always really struggling but it became noticeable since I started in school. I don't know how to describe really all of what was wrong but essentially I struggle with doing stuff and planning stuff, which then causes a lot of stress and anxiety in my life. Some examples of this are: I am late almost every day without fail. Both at school and at work. This has caused endless punishments, detentions, disciplinaries, I have even lost jobs. I am completely unable to keep my home space neat and tidy. It's not even a little bit messy, it is full on disastrous and could probably make it onto a tv show. It doesn't seem to matter how hard I try, I can't manage these simple things and it causes a lot of stress and shame and embarrassment. The period of my life where I became suicidal was when I lost my dream career and got fired after being completely unable to keep to deadlines and failing some professional exams that I couldn't be disciplined enough to study for. \n\nI have been this way all my life, and I don't doubt that I suffer from depression, I just feel that my worst times can be connected to when my life has fallen apart due to me being my own worst enemy. When I took the medicine, it helped but only very slightly. It seemed to stop me feeling emotionally overwhelmed but it did nothing to help the feeling of everything being constantly out of control. If I could describe it, I would say it feels like being on the wrong escalator, constantly trying to run to keep up with everyone but never managing. \n\nIf I were to take an uneducated guess, I would say that from reading online, what I experience seems to fit more closely to ADHD or something similar than simply depression. I mentioned this to my GP and I almost feel like she didn't really believe me.  She was very nice, and reassured me that it was normal to feel overwhelmed sometimes and that I shouldn't worry too much about it and if I had really had ADHD, I wouldn't have been able to get the results in school that I did or have had what looked like no troubles.  I should also say that I have recently started uni to study medicine and so it may have looked like I was trying to self diagnose, or been paranoid or at very worst drug seeking. \n\nI don't feel comfortable talking about it but this is a thing that really affects my life and I really need help, I just dont know how to go about getting that help. Any advice would be very much appreciated. Thank you for reading my very long post."

        "reddit": "* Age: 20\n* Sex: F\n* Height: 5' 6\"\n* Weight: 125lb\n* Race: Asian\n* Duration of complaint: N/A\n* Location (Geographic and on body): N/A\n* Any existing relevant medical issues (if any): N/A\n* Current medications (if any): Birth control\n* Include a photo if relevant (skin condition for example)\n\nHi everybody,\n\nIt has recently come to my attention that some of my more questionable habits and thoughts may actually be diagnosable. I always thought I just had fluid morals and a very logical brain, but having come across some literature about sociopathy, I find myself identifying a surprising amount. If some psychologists or anyone with experience with sociopathy, ASPD, etc. could give some input, that would be great. I'll base my explanations and anecdotes off of google results from \"sociopath symptoms\".\n\n\\-Impulsive; I usually have a vague plan for the rest of my day, not beyond. I'll deviate if I feel like it at the moment. I have a very addictive personality and have learned at an early age to stay away from candy, games, and at an older age, drugs, and alcohol. I wouldn't be able to control myself.\n\n\\-Feelings of superiority; I've always been told I'm smart and am headed places. I am relatively driven, rational, and reasonably intelligent. I also came from a great socioeconomic background, so I've been given the perfect background to leverage these characteristics. I have worked for the position I am in and have taken advantage of the opportunities I have.  As a result, generally speaking, I will believe I am more intelligent/capable/more successful based on my value system than others.\n\n\\-Compulsive lying: If I can avoid a small inconvenience and it'll never have any consequences to me, I have no issue lying. It's not a conscious decision, I'll just do it. Unsure if that's \"compulsive\", but it's very easy.\n\n\\-\"Taught\" social and emotional behavior. I tend to psychoanalyze myself quite often, and I have noticed that when I step out of my own skin and try to consider things objectively, I'll stop feeling whatever proper emotion I might be feeling given the context. This has led me to realize/hypothesize that many of my emotional responses have been conditioned. I've tested this a couple of times in circumstances where a friend is upset or hurt and I am upset or hurt in response. I realized that it is very tiring to keep up with emotional responses in my head, and it is much simpler for me to keep it on the outside instead.\n\n\\-Familial relationships: To further test out the above point, I have also imagined the death of a parent or family member to see how it would emotionally affect me. I have a good relationship with both parents. Having immersed me in the theoretical scenario, this is how my mental process reacted:\n\n1. Shock, sadness. Genuine sadness that someone I was close with is gone and I can never talk to them again. \n2. I think about how it's \"probably good\" to feel sad. It would be morally and societally wrong not to have this response.\n3. I would get tired of being sad (not a fun state to be in) and realize that there's no real reason to conform in my head.\n4. I would then probably choose not to be sad. I may feel depressed or dissociated for months after, but not sad.\n\n\\-I'm very perceptive to other people's feelings and emotions; this has led me to be able to act in a way that makes other people feel good about themselves in conversation, etc. This has helped me quite a bit in management/leadership scenarios and for maintaining a reputation for being a good person. however, if I don't care about what the person thinks, it's more effort than its worth.\n\n\\-Morality: I have realized that I really don't draw any lines. I don't see the point of drawing lines. In my humble philosophical opinion, people do things that are \"wrong\" because they've marinated in their own heads. It's logical and reasonable to their moralities and their rationales. There's no absolute right or wrong, and we can never find it. That's why, personally, I think there's no point in suppressing your urges and would rather maximize pleasure or meaning (different things) even if it deviates socially. Generally speaking, I think some things are \"wrong\" in the sense that they're irrational or disgusting, but I can understand their thinking and emotions. I tend to internally think less of people who have a strong sense of \"right\" or \"wrong\", or people who get emotional.\n\n\\-I have not experienced traumatic events in the past. Generally had a great childhood and was well-provided for. Besides the above-average controlling/strict parents, emphasis on success, lack of deep emotional connection in the family environment, pretty good I would say. 6/10. (in terms of psychological history, nobody has really been to the doctor. My mother may have mild anxiety, but nothing outstanding).\n\nTLDR:\n\n\\- Impulsive but could just be bad self-control\n\n\\- feelings of superiority but could just be that I was raised that way/have actually met goals that I value\n\n\\- some easy lying but perhaps not compulsive, \"taught\" emotions are tiring and it's easier to just react on the surface rather than internalizing\n\n\\- \"manipulative\" behavior but perhaps just a good people person\n\n\\- disrespect for rules and boundaries but maybe just different moral philosophy (or lack of)\n\nSorry for the long post, thanks for your time :)"

Just wanted other opinions.\n\nHi all!\n\nStarting when I was about 18/19 years old, I started getting joint pains. I believed it was because I started becoming more active when I went to college and was putting more strain on my joints as I was exercising much more frequently. It became worse when I was running or using the treadmill, so I stick with the arc trainer, elliptical, bike, or stair master for my cardio (Lower impact). I notice joint discomfort when I do certain movements/exercises, so I try to reposition, but there\u2019s a lot that makes my joints pop or feel really uncomfortable with repetitive motion. But I\u2019ve managed and I just would joke around that I was an arthritic 18 year old.\n\nHowever, when I graduated college it got a lot worse. So bad, in fact, the pain started waking me up at night sometimes. The joint pain is not constant per se and usually a joint will hurt for a short period of time (a few days to a few weeks) and then it goes away. Certain joints are worse than others but none of them are immune. I\u2019ve noticed that in stressful times in my life it seems to get worse. I also was/am incredibly fatigued, and felt extremely run down. That\u2019s when I decided to see my PCP.\n\nOver time I saw a lot of doctors and got a LOT of blood drawn. I had a positive ANA three times, and every time the pattern was both homogenous and speckled, plus I have Raynauds mainly in my feet which is sometimes indicative of connective tissue disease, leading most MDs to believe I had some kind of auto immune disease. I got tested for everything: lupus, sjogrens, Lymes, diabetes etc. My maternal grandmother had Rheumatoid Arthritis so I got tested for that twice and my Rheumatoid Factor was always normal. My sister has Hashimotos so they tested my thyroid but it was completely normal.\n\nOne doctor posited that since I have a history of recurrent strep perhaps I had Rheumatic Fever that was attacking my body. My ASO tested positive twice during the time they took all this blood and I was put on antibiotics twice even though I didn\u2019t feel sick at all and haven\u2019t really had full blown strep in two years. I went to a cardiologist since Rheumatic Fever is really bad for your heart and was totally normal (minus some stress or caffeine induced palpitations I get sometimes). \n\nAnother theory brought to my attention was that a screw I have in my arm is being rejected by my body, and that it\u2019s being attacked as foreign which is why I always have a positive ANA. I broke my arm when I was in college and had to get surgery on it, including a screw that is still there. My symptoms started around that time but I genuinely could not tell you whether or not I had joint pain before or after that surgery since I really didn\u2019t put any thought into the pain when I was that age. \n\nFinally, my rheumatologist after many many tests said it was Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA). He said the only diagnostic credential to be diagnosed with JIA is more than one positive ANA a certain amount of time apart (which I meet). He explained some people grow out of it and some don\u2019t. \n\nI accepted the diagnosis and moved on with my life, and while it seems to make sense there\u2019s a part of me that wonders, especially since my symptoms didn\u2019t manifest until I was older. A criteria for JIA is that symptoms begin when you\u2019re younger than 16, but I was a freshman in college at the time. It also just feels like he went with that diagnosis since everything else was seemingly ruled out and I just kept showing positive for the ANA. I also read that usually people with JIA have an elevated ESR and CRP, which i do not. \n\nI am just curious to see what Reddit thinks. Did this doctor get it right? Or do I have a diagnosis that isn\u2019t correct?"

Once I got it I experienced so much anxiety because as it was, I\u2019m already dealing with severe health anxiety/hypochondriac. To the point that this Monday I pooped and I was convinced that there was poop in my blood, I was scouring super close to my poop with my phone light on even and saw / couple small red specs. I was looking really close. I went to the ER and the doctor looked at my hemorrhoid, at first he couldn\u2019t find it because it was so small. Once he did he said it was a small external hemorrhoid but it is not clotted or anything. He scooped in my anus to take a sample and he said there was also no blood on his sample. I immediately thought back to what I ate and I do remember eating some papaya and tomatoes,  so maybe that\u2019s what caused it. He said it was possible that maybe it was blood but it might also be from my constipation or hemorrhoid and to not worry. He told me if I wanted to I could follow up with a GI doctor. I had already been terrified that I have colon cancer even before I got the hemorrhoid because I had been feeling tender in my abdomen and constipation for weeks (again, I have health anxiety).

Sometimes I do spend maybe a little too much time on the toilet and I still have to exert force sometimes to poop. The point is that I thought it was subsiding because I felt it less and less present, although the bump still there. I thought it was really getting better until last night I woke up anxious and noticed it more. It was more itchy and more noticeable, kind of like how it felt when it first flared up. I\u2019m really looking for some advice if this is normal or not. Like how long do these usually take to resolve and even if it will resolve....I\u2019m in full on panic mode right now.

Eat a 80% whole foods plant-based diet (the other 20% vegan but not WFPB). B12 supplement. I have no current or past nutritional deficiencies. I lost access to my thyroid meds for about 5 months when I left a school program earlier this year (lost insurance) and gained about 15 lbs in that time. 8 weeks ago I got my meds back and have subsequently lost all of the weight I gained since then.  **RECENT LAB WORK LOCATED AT BOTTOM OF POST.**\n\nStarting in 2014, I began to notice unusual urination. I had to pee more often and my urine smelled odd. I went to the doctor who checked for diabetes, UTI, kidney infections and STI's but was fine. Told not to worry about it.\n\nIn 2015-2016, the need to **urinate more often** was increasing and starting to seriously affect my quality of life. I went to the doctor again about it but at this time I was on Medicaid while I served in AmeriCorps. My doctor worked in a clinic and was BEYOND overwhelmed. When I told her my issues at my annual she said, verbatim, \"I don't have time to hear this right now\". As per usual when I bring up this issue, they just check for diabetes and infections. Always fine.\n\n***Thyroid info if relevant:*** I was first diagnosed as a teenager. Eventually determined after years of varying labs that it was Hashimoto's Thyroiditis. In 2016, the Medicaid clinic doctor ordered routine thyroid labs because I was on meds for that and that's when they noticed low TSH, low T4, and low T3 with hypo symptoms. Diagnosed secondary hypothyroidism and referred to an endocrinologist, but no one was taking new Medicaid patients so I just had to wait. When I finally got private insurance again, went again for routine stuff and blood work, and doctor said it was just traditional hypothyroidism with high TSH and low free T4 so I never ended up seeing an endo.\n\nOver the past couple of years, it's gotten increasingly debilitating. I feel **thirsty constantly** and seem to get symptoms of **dehydration unusually easily.** Restricting fluids doesn't effectively limit the urine output and I will eventually start getting too dehydrated and thirsty. In the past few months, I've started getting **dizzy all the time** (even when lying down), **dizziness and blackouts in vision when I stand up,** **noticeable shakiness in my hands,** and **nausea.** Home blood pressure cuff shows **elevated BP** on average (take it multiple times per day at home because doctors think \"white coat syndrome\" and my anxiety are skewing the VERY high in-office numbers) but significant variations within that (mostly normal, sometimes elevated and sometimes in stage 2 hypertension over 140/90).\n\nOver the past few weeks I did fasting blood/urine labs for my issues, and these labs plus symptoms are what prompted my GP to refer to the nephrologist.

        "reddit": "Location - UK\nGender - Male\nHeight - 6ft 1\nWeight - 16st\nMedical issues - ME/CFS (moderate to severe), OCD and Anxiety + displaying Autistic traits\n\nAll blood tests show a \u2018healthy\u2019 individual (2016).\n\n(NO HISTORY OF DRUG ABUSE\nThe only pharmaceutical drugs I have taken are antidepressants prescribed by my GP, and one off label medication I prescribed myself) \n\nI have a good relationship with my GP (general practitioner), but I feel I\u2019ve been left neglected by the NHS despite literally crying out for help regarding my symptoms\n\nPrior to the onset of my ME/CFS, I was an incredibly fit individual who would exercise 5-6 days a week that ranged from boxing, HIIT training and weight training. In the course of 5 years, I have become practically housebound in a ground floor apartment due to the worsening of my symptoms.\n\nI was put on Venlafaxine/Effexor (titrated up to 150mg) and I have to say, I was able to sleep much better and I felt so calm. It was the only antidepressant that I\u2019ve had success with. After around a year of being on the Venlafaxine, I decided to slowly reduce the dosage and come off the medication as I felt my psychological health was somewhat better.\n\nComing off the medication was easy until I got to the final few milligram, and the withdrawals started (brain zaps) and severe fatigue crept in that hasn\u2019t gone until this day. After the withdrawal phase, my brain returned back to feeling \u2018okay\u2019, but within 3 short months, SEVERE, and I mean severe sensory overload \u2018kicked in\u2019. Any sound, any light, some motion and most smells would cause my brain a lot of pain that I would describe as a throbbing sensation located in my forehead spreading behind my eyes with a horrible migraine added to it. When I remove myself from these stimuli, my brain feels okay. The moment I am introduced to stimuli again, my brain \u2018throbs\u2019. Just two minutes of watching the TV or being on my phone causes these symptoms without fail, regardless of time and day.\n\nI have explained these symptoms to my GP and a neurologist who I saw, and they didn\u2019t do anything about it. I spent ONE WHOLE YEAR by myself in silence because my brain hasn\u2019t been able to process or tolerate any stimuli. So that means no mobile phone, no TV, no radio or music, and no book reading. At one point I couldn\u2019t even look out of a window because the movement of the outside world would cause a flare up in my brain.\n\nIf you wonder why I\u2019m able to to write this, it\u2019s because I have HAD to start using marijuana. I am aware that THC reduces calcium signalling as well as somewhat reducing glutamate signalling within the brain, so that\u2019s why I\u2019m feeling relief using the marijuana. (CBD doesn\u2019t work).\n\nSo my understanding is that my neurotransmission or neurotransmission metabolism is dysfunctional (glutamate and GABA and noradrenaline).\n\nCannabis has been my last alternative, believe me. I meditate daily, I TRY and eat as clean as I can as well as intermittent fasting daily. I\u2019ve previously tried a Keto diet to promote the production of GABA and GAD, and it didn\u2019t help. I do not want to start taking benzodiazepines due to the withdrawal issues I\u2019ve read. Also, I\u2019ve heard that they end up down-regulating GABA receptors, hence that\u2019s why I decided to stay house bound in silence for 13 months instead of attempting to take Klonopin etc etc.\n\nI can\u2019t go on like this because I can\u2019t keep relying on a substance that is illegal here in the UK, as well as spending most of my money on it due to these symptoms. The pain within my brain is horrible and without THC, I can\u2019t be in any scenario where there\u2019s light, sound and motion and smell, it\u2019s that simple.\n\nI also notice that anything related to boosting noradrenaline or inhibiting the noradrenaline reuptake causes an inflammation within these symptoms (throbbing pain/migraine feeling). Even Tyrosine will cause my symptoms to be worse (I believe noradrenaline is derived from tyrosine).\n\nBelow is a list of supplements I have taken in attempt to correct this glutamate/GABA issue. None have worked, and therefore, I no longer take these supplements.\n\n. Kava Kava (kind of worked, but I couldn\u2019t afford it and the reverse tolerance was a nightmare)\n. Kratom\n. L-Thianine\n. Memantine (not prescribed. Taken very briefly without success)\n. Low Dose Naltrexone\n. Taurine\n. Valerian Root\n. CBD\n. GABA (apparently it doesn\u2019t cross the BBB)\n. NAC\n\n\nSupplements I take are:\n\n. Multi vitamin &amp; multi mineral\n. Vit B12 - (hydroxocobalamin) - Self injection\n. Vit C - (ascorbic acid)\n. Co Enzyme Q10\n. L-Carnitine\n. Tryptophan\n. Magnesium (transdermal)\n. Niacinamide\n. Marijuana (approximately every 4 hours. That\u2019s how long the THC lasts and my symptoms re-appear.\n\n\nSupporting notes that I feel are beneficial:\n\nMy autistic symptoms have been with me since a child (non diagnosed, but been referred), however, they became MUCH worse since having ME/CFS.\n\nI also think the vigorous exercise was a trigger for my ME/CFS, as I became unwell shortly after starting my exercise routine. (I\u2019m thinking some nutritional deficiency of some kind)\n\nIt would make sense that my GABA/Glutamate metabolism was already dysfunctional, and the SNRI\u2019s made things worse when I discontinued the drug.\n\nI would suggest that I have low noradrenaline levels, because since I have discontinued the medication, my pain threshold is not like it used to be, as well as my fatigue becoming the worst it\u2019s ever been. I believe these symptoms point to a noradrenaline issue, but whenever I\u2019ve tried rectify it, it causes the pain in my brain to become worse, so I no longer bother.\n\nI would lastly like to mention, that I have tried to \u2018push through\u2019 the pain with no success, and I refuse to do it anymore. Also, NONE of the supplements I currently take have contributed to the cause or worsening of my symptoms. \n\nAlso, I would ask anyone who is kind enough to look into this issue with me to hold back on the comments about my cannabis use, as this plant is the only substance that is helping me as of late.\n\nCheers :)"

        "reddit": "Age: 29 l Sex: F l Height: 5'8 l Weight: 165 \nRace: Caucasian \n\nTwo nights ago I woke up around 2:00 a.m. with upper abdominal pain. I took 600mg of ibuprofen thinking it was muscle soreness resulting from my earlier ab workout. \n\nThe pain very quickly spread throughout my entire abdomen. It felt like my entire abdominal wall was severely cramping and tightening, similar to the brief but breathtaking pain immediately following strenuous abdominal exercise. In this case, the pain was prolonged and unbelievably intense, so much so that I was nauseated by it.\n\nWithin 10-15 minutes of the onset of the pain I also had severe chills and was profusely sweating, to the point where there was a steady drip of cold sweat from my forehead to the ground. I felt light-headed and like I could pass out at any moment. \n\nAt about the 20 minute mark, I called 911. By the time I made the call, I was on the floor curled in the fetal position, groaning and rocking. It was difficult to breathe through the pain and, although I was panting, my breaths were very shallow. The pain was so intense that it was difficult to respond to the 911 operator's questions. Each word I uttered was absolute agony. I genuinely feared for my life.\n\nAt the 35 minute mark the paramedics arrived. I don't know when exactly but at some point the pain and symptoms that were rapidly and steadily increasing hit their peak and began to decrease. For the first time since the pain fully manifested, I started doubting whether I absolutely had to go to the ER. I didn't want to go to the ER because I didn't want to miss work. \n\nAt probaly the 45 minute mark, the pain lessened to the point where I was able to look at the paramedics as I spoke to them. Prior to that I was hunched in a ball on my knees rocking back and forth, panting and steadily dripping sweat, and couldn't bring myself to open my eyes.\n\nBy the 55 minute mark I had almost no symptoms except what felt like waves of bad menstrual cramps -- markedly different than the full abdominal wall pain I'd felt earlier. \n\nBy the 60 minute mark I felt normal. The paramedics left after taking my vitals which were higher than usual for me but all in normal ranges (blood pressure 137/80, heart rate 70, don't remember others).\n\nThat was that. I went back to bed and slept soundly until I woke up for work. I can't find anything even remotely like my symptoms after googling/reading for probably over 10 hours today.\n\nThings that I've linked in my mind as potentially relevant but might have absolutely nothing to do with this:\n-Intense core workout the previous day but it wasn't *that* intense as I'm not very sore today\n-No gastro illness at all that night or the following day (i.e., no gas, no abnormal waste, etc.)\n-I've had the copper IUD for ~6 months \n-I was in rural Canada last weekend and have a ton of bug bites/mosquito bites from that (I googled malaria a ton today and I'm pretty sure that's not it)\n-My mom suggested it might have been a kidney stone passing but I've had zero other symptoms and the whole thing lasted an hour\n-I'm on my period (e.g., not pregnant)\n-I didn't drink the day before\n-I had 2mg of THC/5mg CBD that night before bed (micro doses) \n-No allergies \n-No abnormal food at all that day \n-I was and am always extremely well hydrated. I'd had about 3L of water that day.\n-I've been taking food-based vitamins for about 6 months that give me about 50% daily total of various vitamins (Vitamin Code Multi for Women)\n\nThis has seriously stumped me. I'm ready to chalk it up to a freak accident. \n\nAt the same time, I have lingering anxiety that it could happen again at any moment because it was so seemingly random. Any insight is much appreciated."

        "reddit": "20 male 6\u2019 165lbs white. I went to my GP after months of experiencing fatigue that got bad enough to cause my to lose nearly 15 pounds as I did not have the energy to feel hungry or eat. My life was go to class and come back to my apt and get in bed. My doc had my symptoms as unintentional weight loss, fatigue and brain fog. I had basic blood work done with also some disease checks. Everything came back normal besides testing positive for h. Pylori. He recommended I treat it with a course of antibiotics and go from there. After a 3 week treatment and being retested for H. Pylori that came back negative, I was set to see him in another 3 weeks to check how I was feeling. At that point seeing him again I told him I had stopped losing weight, my energy level had improved slightly and the brain fog was still there just not a severe. He took this as good news as my symptoms were improving but still wanted to see me in another 2 months for a check up. Once I saw him again my fatigue had returned to the same level as it had before being treated for h. Pylori. At this point I went into detail about my fatigue and how severe it could be. Basically I am sleepy majority of the day. I get 8-9 hours a sleep a night but still feel the need to take a nap during the day. My \u201cnaps\u201d can last as long as 3-4 hours even with proper sleep. Basically my mind feels like it can no longer work (brain fog) until I take a nap. Sometimes if I\u2019m lucky I can set an alarm and only take a 30 minute nap and that seems to do the job of giving my mind a reset. But it seems like I go into a deep sleep very quickly so once that alarm goes off it\u2019s nearly impossible for me to get up. To me I think I described excessive sleepiness as my body does not feel fatigued. Most days the drowsiness causes me to get little to nothing done. Describing this to him he just didn\u2019t seem to care. My GP just told me that he doesn\u2019t know why I feel like this and that he would see my in a year at my physical. He told me if it gets worse to go back to him. At this point I feel hopeless. A month has gone by since I saw him last and nothing has changed. I just feel exhausted most of the time. Doing some of my own research my symptoms line up a lot with narcolepsy or depression even though I don\u2019t feel sad and my main issue is fatigue/ excessive tiredness. When I don\u2019t feel tired I am constantly worry when the fatigue will hit which it always does. I tried to convince myself that how I\u2019m feeling is fine and that I should listen to my doctor but I know how I\u2019m feeling is not normal. I\u2019m still under my parents insurance and I don\u2019t know how to explain to them that I\u2019m not better even though my doctor is saying otherwise. I don\u2019t want to come across as complaining but this is effecting every aspect of my life. I quit my job, I scheduled my college classes all online besides 1 because I just don\u2019t have the energy to make it to them physically, I have 0 social life as I again don\u2019t have the energy to actually do anything with friends. This has been going on for ~8 months. Some days are better than others. I know this was a lot but basically I\u2019m asking was my doctor right in telling me what he did? What do I do from here? I don\u2019t want to have to live like this. I\u2019m 20 and feel like I\u2019m 85 most of the time."

It came on again today after I laid down in bed after a day of walking around, but this time it got worse after I went to the bathroom.

I've seen a bunch of doctors, gotten a bunch of tests, and still getting zero answers or solutions... so thought I'd try Reddit again :)\n\nFemale, age 44, 5\u20198\u201d, 150 lbs\n\nHealth history: Hashimoto\u2019s (caused thyroid nodules, but so far, hasn\u2019t affected thyroid levels), seasonal allergies, chronic upper back issues, mild anxiety\n\nSmoked cigarettes for 25 years, quit for two years, vaped for 1.5 years, quit everything since June 2019\n\nMedications: Zantac (for about a month now), multivitamin, occasional CBD drops for anxiety\n\n**SYMPTOMS SINCE LATE APRIL 2019:**\n\nMild soreness at all times in left chest and all over the left pectoral region, left rib, left neck, left shoulder and down the left arm\n\nTightness in upper chest wall, soreness in collarbone\n\nOften a sore throat, sometimes feels like lump in throat and/or sternum, and at times it feels like it's a bit hard to swallow food or like food gets caught in chest\n\nPain gets worse when I drink caffeine or use nicotine (which I have quit)\n\nHeart racing or \"fluttering\" at times\n\nSometimes if feels like an internal itchy feeling in chest (pins and needles mixed with an actual internal \"itch\"), extending down from my left pecs to my left rib and below the rib\n\nOddly enough, at times this pain even goes into my left ear\n\n**BACKGROUND:**\n\nI had an extremely stressful winter with various issues. Meanwhile, I was vaping on the Juul (high nicotine, menthol) all hours of the day to \u201cdeal with\u201d my stress (I realize this was counterproductive).\n\nIn late April 2019, I started having symptoms of what felt like a heart attack -- including left-side chest and neck pain that radiated down my left arm and into my left hand, as well as a racing/flutter feeling in my chest. I went to the ER and my ECG was normal.\n\nAlthough mild, this chest pain feeling was pretty constant, but got a lot more intense when I consumed nicotine in the form of vaping (which I quit), nicotine lozenges, and nicotine gum. So I quit all nicotine products on June 10.\n\nHowever, the symptoms continued. Not as intensely (like a 2-4 on a scale of 1-10), but steady from the time I wake up until I go to sleep, getting worse when I eat, get stressed out, drink caffeine, etc. So I've tried stretching, managing stress, adjusting my diet, etc.\n\nFour months later, the symptoms continue, and the pain has even gotten worse in some regards...\n\n**TESTING:**\n\nIn the past four months, I have had numerous heart tests, including about three ECGs, a couple CT scans, a PET scan, nuclear stress test, echocardiogram, and cardiac patch monitor. I also tried some nitroglycerin and calcium channel blockers to see if it helped, in the event that it was microvascular. I didn\u2019t notice a difference, so the cardiologist said to stop taking.\n\nAfter all those heart tests, cardiology problems were ruled out.\n\nLung/breathing problems were ruled out according to pulmonary doctors.\n\nBreast exam was normal.\n\nEar, nose and throat exam was normal.\n\nI have a few thyroid nodules (from Hashimoto's), but just had a scan and they were fine, and my TSH levels are normal.\n\nUpper and middle chest and neck X-rays ruled out a slipped disc or any major injuries.\n\nWas having dizziness/off-kilter feeling at some point in this process, so I had a brain MRI. Normal results. Probably was a separate thing related to medication/allergies, cold/virus, and/or anxiety from not knowing what is going on.\n\nAlso had full blood count (normal), SED rate test to determine inflammation (normal).\n\nHad an upper endoscopy, and they didn't find anything major except a small hiatal hernia and esophageal thrush, for which I took 2 weeks of Fluconazole. They didn\u2019t think either of these things would be causing all the symptoms, since the hernia is small and the thrush was minimal.\n\nHad a GI follow-up and doctor ordered a manometry (i.e. esophageal motility test) and I'm still waiting on the results (should know in a week). Nurse said she thought she noticed a weakness in my upper esophageal muscles. I shared this with the doctor and she got annoyed since the official results aren't in yet.\n\nCurrently I'm taking Zantac until we find out if it's related to GI stuff (at which point they would probably start a PPI). Also started a low-acid diet, but even with that, certain foods still trigger symptoms. Also propping up my head a bit with an adjustable bed frame.\n\n**TRIGGERS:**\n\nThe left-side pain is there all the time, but things that make it worse include: working at a desk all day, eating acid reflux trigger foods, but also many other foods, drinking anything other than water or chamomile tea, heavy exercise, very hot weather, nicotine, alcohol, ibuprofen, anxiety, anger\n\n**POSSIBLE CAUSES:**\n\nMy current theory is \"chest wall pain\" plus bad acid reflux, but who the heck knows. It seems like there are a couple of things going on. The left arm pain is what is throwing me off -- why would acid reflux cause such prominent pain in my arm?\n\nI have quickly learned that the doctors don't want my theories, and if you aren't dying, they are in absolutely no rush to diagnose or treat you (at least with my healthcare). So it's all going very slowly, and I'm not sure I'll ever get an answer. I may just have to get used to it.\n\nOne doctor told me it's all Somatic Symptom Disorder and to take anxiety meds. I'm going to see a therapist and probably start taking meds, but even when I meditate, take CBD, do yoga, acupuncture, massage, the pain is still there.\n\nAnother doctor said she thought it was nerve damage, but had no definitive solutions. I saw a physical therapist and she's doing some stretches with me, but she doesn't see any PT issues that would be causing this stuff.\n\nIt's the not knowing that is the hardest part -- I have never had something like this go on for so long with no answers.\n\nThanks for reading."

I was surprised to see my liver panel come back very abnormally, as I've never had any issues in the past. She asked me to come back in for follow-up blood work on August 13th and I'm currently awaiting for my follow up appointment which is causing me great anxiety. Here were my test results from both labs:\n\nJuly 9- AST: 297, ALT: 263, Alkaline Phosphatase: 118 \n\nAugust 13- AST: 207, ALT: 211, Alkaline Phosphatase: 134\n\nBetween the two tests I didn't knowingly change anything about my diet, exercise, etc. so I'm not sure if those changes in numbers are significant or maybe just due to other factors. Might also be important to note that my August 13th panel confirmed negative results for Hepatitis and also showed an elevated TSH level at 6.450- the highest I've ever had despite previous struggles with hypothyroidism. \n\nIn addition to these tests, over the course of the last month or so I've been experiencing nausea after nearly every meal, regardless of what it is, what time of day it is, how much I eat, etc. Eggs on two occasions have made me thrown up my entire meal where everything else seems to just leave me feeling queasy and has resulted in me not eating very much. \n\nBased on what I've read on the internet (I know this isn't smart... but we all do it, right?) I'm guessing I have NAFLD, however, in all of the forums/posts I've seen I haven't seen anyone with quite as high numbers as me so I'm concerned. My follow-up isn't until next week so at this point I'm driving myself insane with theories and whatnot. Any insight for me? I have not been the best with my diet in my early adult years and I'm really worried I may have caused irreversible damage. Thanks in advance for any and all advice."

It was an uncomfortable, but relatively brief feeling similar to dread. It was accompanied by nausea and difficulty breathing and I was worried I may throw up, but it eased up after a minute or so. It happened again today, but it was shorter and not as bad as the first one. I'm slightly worried becuase googling this feeling brought up mostly epilepsy and seizures.\n\nI dunno if this is related, but I think a similar thing happened when I was 8 and I ended up throwing up something yellowish. I apparently also have an anxiety issue ([I've already made a post about it before](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/bq2ovi/constantly_felt_like_vomiting_for_the_past_10/), idk if that may give some insight). It seems most of its symptoms abated, so I'm not really sure if what I'm experiencing now could be related to it.\n\nBecause of those symptoms I've had (still have most of them + occasional hypnic jerks), I've visited my GP, two gastroenterologists and a neurologist. CBC is fine, abdominal ultrasounds are fine, neurologist exam is fine, TSH and FT4 are in normal range and stool tests are fine.

I don't know the names of his medications, I just know he takes medications for hypertension and T2 diabetes. For the past 2 days he was in the hospital for severe pain associated with kidney stones. \n\nThe symptoms appeared on Sunday morning and he went to urgent care, and then to the ER. The stones were confirmed when they were found on a CAT scan and ultrasound. He had to go to the hospital because the pain was so bad  that the pills they sent him home with weren't working. Yesterday morning, the pain subsided, he had another scan that confirmed that he had passed the stones, as they were no longer visible on the scan, and they sent him home. \n\nToday he said he still wasn't feeling good, but he was able to move, drive, cook, and go to the library again when for the past 2 days he had been totally incapacitated. He complained of feeling worn down and tired. He attributed it to having not eaten during the 4 days he had the stones, as he couldn't hold food down. He also said he had been off his vitamins for the past 4 days and he thinks that may have something to do with it. He said he still didn't really feel like eating but he ate a little bit of lunch anyway and he took his vitamins. He felt well enough to go grocery shopping, just very tired. \n\nAbout a hour ago he said the pain had returned. He's now lying in bed, incapacitated by the same pain he was having when he had the stones. He spent 6 additional hours at the hospital yesterday after the first initial scans that had confirmed the stones were no longer present, taking more tests and scans to make sure they were not detected. No further kidney stones were detected.\n\nHe doesn't understand why he's still in so much pain even though he had passed the stones. He'll be going back to the doctor soon but he wants to know if it's possible to still feel the pain of a kidney stone after passing it. He's at the end of his rope because he really thought he was out of the woods, he was feeling fine except for the lethargy, the doctors said he was fine, and now he's not feeling fine anymore. We're all worried and would like to know what may be going on. Can the pain still linger after the stones are passed? Could there be another stone that just spontaneously formed?"

I'm diagnosed with a Hiatus Hernia and acid reflux. I also have a chronic sinusitis since an early age and never received treatment for it, which had me sneezing up to 40-50 times in a row. Allergywise I only have an allergy against birches, which I last tested 2014. I also suffer from a lot of anxiety and depression, which lead me to Citalopram and Klonazepam(I only took Klonazepam after I was victim of a violent crime for a couple of weeks to deal with the trauma) in the past. I don't take any kind of anxiety meds anymore for nearly 2 years.\n\nThat said, I used to smoke cigarettes and cannabis(which was definitely laced for a while, since I had no idea that laced drugs are a thing). I also smoked it in big bong rips with a tobacco mix, which sometimes really hurt my lungs.\n\nFast forward; For around 3 years I'm having difficulties breathing, which forced me to start taking cortison inhalers on a irregular base for weeks at a time. Currently I'm using Symbicort 200, which is a mix of Budesonide and Formoterol, twice a day, two puffs each.\n\nHere comes the crucial part; I still consume cannabis(non-laced, medical grade) and use a vaporizer to consume it. \n\nSo yesterday I rushed to the hospital, in fear of suffocation. They checked my blood, did a chest x-ray, listened to my breathing and send me home, telling me I have top blood values and lungs that sound free. Also my peak flow meter device reaches a healthy value, which indicates that my lungs can take in enough air. \n\nI'm really not sure if all of this is mental, and I'm putting all this cortisone in my lungs or if there is a serious, underlying condition. Doctors told me before that they are not sure if I even have anything when they listened to my breathing.\n\n\n\nThanks!"

I mean, I think the lab or my doctor would\u2019ve informed us if there was a suspicion but I can\u2019t help but think it\u2019s something bad.\n\nI would also like to say I don\u2019t feel any different than I usually do. The only thing I seem to experience that can be linked to anemia is dizziness/lightheadedness but I rarely ever feel like that. I\u2019ve only felt like that once between today and last month ."

I work outside a lot but my job doesn't have health insurance, and I was dropped from my parents insurance when they retired. I first noticed this when I was in the shower last Tuesday, I just was washing and I bumped into it and it hurt. I was worried I might have caused torsion because it hurt but it wasn't THAT bad. But it did feel painful to touch. Now it's been a little over a week and it's a lot better now, before it felt more like a 4 or 5 on pain and would be intense if I touched it or moved around too much but it would often go away. But then sometimes I would do something and it would cause that pain again.\n\nNow I occasionally feel it, but it's a solid 2 or 3. It's a lot less frequent. Everything else is normal, peeing and ejaculating lol. I think it might be just something inflamed or whatever because if I touch around, I won't feel pain until I touch the back end. I could touch the whole front area and it won't be bothered but if I touch the back area the sharp pain happens. I've heard this could also be a sign of a hernia? What should I do? Should I call a urologist or look for one that takes the uninsured, or go to planned parenthood? I haven't been to my GP in like two years because I both don't like him (family recommended him) and don't have insurance anymore. Could this just be a uti or something that I can wait out?"

        "reddit": "20 Years Old / Female / 5' 8\" / 116 lbs / Anorexia/Potential Suicidal Thoughts?\n\nMy sister lost a lot of weight, from 240 to 114 lbs, in a year and a half. We were obviously ecstatic for her, but when we confronted her and told her she was now approaching an unhealthy weight as she dropped below 120 while continuing to eat a deficit, she refused to listen. Once she hit 114 lbs, she started to experience physical symptoms including: dizziness, lightheadedness, blurred vision, fatigue, and hair loss.\n\nAfter doing some basic research, we determined these were symptoms of being underweight. We told her she should try and gain weight to 122 lbs, to reach a 'healthy weight' by BMI standards as a start. That is when she began to experience serious mental distress. She would constantly call complaining that she felt disgusting and hated herself for gaining weight, and that her \"thighs look huge now,\" despite only gaining what we estimate to be 1-2lbs. She would explain her obsession with a light weight as: \"I like being the skinniest one now,\" and, \"I have the most intense fear of getting fat.\" Despite her anguish, she did promise us she would continue working towards a 'healthy weight.'\n\nThis morning, she sent us a string of texts:\n\n&gt;\"This is not good. I cannot stop crying I have been crying all night. I feel stupid and helpless. Please please pray for me I feel like I am dying inside. Like I really don't know what to do I am so depressed. I really need help. I should have never gained weight it is going to take so long to lose and I am feeling completely hopeless.\"\n\nWhen we called her, she said she had almost called the suicide prevention hotline overnight because of the \"depression she felt about gaining weight\", but that she felt better now. We asked her if she had a plan for how she would kill herself, and she said \"no, I just wished I would die.\"\n\nWhen we went over to her house, she informed us that she intended to start losing weight again, and that she is going to eat 800 calories today to start doing so. She says, \"I can't live unless I get back to where I was, 114lbs.\" I ask her why she \"can't live\" at a healthy weight, and she says \"Because I will kill myself if I have to look like this.\" Despite this, when I tell her that she should really consider being hospitalized for these thoughts, she then claims she's not 'really suicidal.'\n\nFor reference, she also suffers from Trigemial Neuralgia (diagnosed 6 years ago) and takes the following medications daily: 1200mg tegretol, 60mg baclofin, 200mg neurontin. She has a previous history of social anxiety disorder, but has never sought help for it.\n\nThat brings me to the issue: **she DOES recognize that she is suffering from anorexia, BUT she absolutely refuses to receive professional help.** She says she \"cannot talk to a stranger\" about her problems and she \"cannot take another pill.\" I provided her with the book \"Feeling Good\" by David Burns and she refuses to open it. Is there anything we *can* do to help her? She lives alone, and I am very concerned about her comments. How can we proceed in helping her?"

No other medical issues except for some anxiety. \n\nSo I've had this issue since 2012. It all started during a class I was taking to become a personal trainer. We were learning how to take blood pressure, and when another student took mine, it was slightly elevated. From then on, every time someone takes my blood pressure, I get super anxious it\u2019s going to be high and then of course it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy and it is. \n\nNaturally, this issue comes up nearly every time I go to the doctor. When they take my vitals I get so nervous my blood pressure typically spikes to something like 160/100 and even my heart rate spikes to something crazy like 130 bpm. Because of all this, I\u2019ve started taking my own readings at home. When I do, my blood pressure is usually around 110/70 and resting heart rate is pretty low (sometimes even in the 50s because I run a lot).  \n\nMost doctors I\u2019ve seen don\u2019t usually seem too worried after I explain to them I have this issue and that I regularly take my own measurements at home. One had me bring in my blood pressure machine to make sure it matched what we were seeing in the office, but other than that they never seem too worried and just tell me to continue monitoring at home. \n\nHowever, yesterday I saw a new doctor for some anxiety issues I\u2019ve been having. As usual, he saw my blood pressure was high from when the nurse took it. I explained to him I get nervous when people take my blood pressure. He was kind of cold and said something along the lines of, \u201cwell, you shouldn\u2019t be,\u201d and then said, \u201cif it\u2019s high here, it\u2019s always high.\u201d Then we conducted the appointment as normal for the issue I came in for, but he suggested that if my blood pressure is still high when I come in for follow-ups we might want to consider medication or other interventions. \n\nSo, I guess my question is - what is your opinion on this and specifically white coat hypertension? Do I have a problem? From what I\u2019ve read, there are some schools of thought that feel if your blood pressure is high when you\u2019re stressed at the doctors, it\u2019s likely high during other times of stress too. And I guess I understand that to a point, but this is a very specific event I get very stressed for and I\u2019m not walking around quite so stressed like that every day, so I suspect I don\u2019t have a true issue. Maybe I\u2019m wrong though. \n\nAlso, if this truly is a problem I\u2019m happy to take medication for it, but I\u2019m also concerned about the possibility of taking medicine for something I don\u2019t have. I\u2019ve heard of other people like me who\u2019ve taken pills for high bp when they didn\u2019t need them, and it making them pass out or feel awful. \n\nLastly, if you have any tips for getting over white coat hypertension, I\u2019m all ears. The fact that this happens makes me dread going to the doctor. Additionally, I\u2019m going back to school (if I get accepted) to become a PTA and I\u2019m assuming I\u2019ll have to get my blood pressure taken a lot in class, so it would be great to get over this fear. \n\nThanks for any insight!"

        "reddit": "Hello\n\nI am 26 yo female. I have been taking a daily dose of 0,25 mg of alprazolam for the last 7 years if I well recall. When I was a teenager (around 16) I was prescribed alprazolam and an antidepressant for depression, took it for a while and then left it. However, around my 20/21 year I was having a really bad phase in which I was suicidal and my doctor prescribed me an antidepressant. I had been self medicating with some alprazolam left overs that I had home and my doctor thought that it would be better if I continued taking a low dose of it.\n\nNow I decided I want to quit alprazolam. I feel like what's really helping me is the antidepressant and alprazolam is not even the first line of therapy for depression. I also fear the long term effects of it in memory and overall I just want to get healthier and don't be dependent in an external susbtance. My doctor designed a slow tapper off scheme but it never seemed to be the good time to start. Either it was Autumn and I was suffering from seasonal depression, or I was having some family problems or stress at work or lose my job, or a relationship breakup. I just never felt I could do it. When I don't take alprazolam my main symptoms are not anxiety, it's more a feeling of having my mind clouded, being slower and feeling more tired with heavy eyes and blurry vision. \n\nAnyway I started following the scheme my doctor designed to me but I feel this is going to take such a long time and I keep doubting if I really can go until the end since I've been taking this for so long. \n\nI would like to know tips to help me maintain the motivation to do the tapper off and maybe some strategy to make it faster so I don't loose my motivation. In October I will have an appointement with my doctor. Should I ask her to switch to diazepam because it is easier to tapper off that one? I already go to the gym, but should I practice another type of sport like swimming? Would it help reduce my symptoms of fatigue? What about any supplements that you may recommend?"

Started in my stomach and now it is everywhere. \n\nHere are the doctors I currently see that are clueless as to what is going on:\n\nPulmonologist - swelling around my lungs and states that it is starting to go around my heart. Put me on a med that starts with \"C\" but can't remember what it's called. Hurts to breathe and feels like I'm stabbed if my body is touched around it. Swelled especially around my sternum (something called an odd name with an \"x\" \n\nGastroenterologist - my duodenum is highly inflammatory so I got put on the fodmap diet. It helps but inflammation will not go away. Had 2 polyps removed from my upper intestines that were too big for how old they were since I had the same test done last year and now have to have one next year from it. I also have internal hemorrhoids if that matters. \n\nCardiologist - my heart rate raises very high easily for no known reason. Tilt table test is inconclusive because I raise only 28, not 30. But I can't do stress tests because my heart rate jumps to over 200 in less than 6 minutes. I pass out if I get too hot so I can't do too much outside. I had a test where they checked my muscles and my right side is weaker but that is probably because I had brain surgery on my left side. (temporal and occipital lobes removed) \n\nENT- Swollen lymph nodes in my neck on the right side for over 3 years. Pain is getting worse. Will possibly need surgery to remove the worse ones. \n\nGynecologist - lots of pain so blame is endometriosis which probably makes sense but it hurts so bad. I was stage 3 two years ago and need a hysterectomy. \n\nUrologist - kidney and bladder pain. Just had a huge kidney cyst removed and my bladder tied up. Lots of pain in these areas for 6 years. \n\nFoot and hand doctors - several surgeries have been done to remove hard lumps and to reset my feet. I grow lipomas and cysts like crazy in these places, along with my back and arms. Right now, my feet and ankle are swelling if I even try to walk and they feel like they are going to break. I was told it was my tendons swelling and she had no idea why - it had to be from something else. \n\nNeurologist - seizures are coming back 8 years after having surgery and it's probably from the stress I'm going through with all this.\n\nI see so many doctors it's hard to remember them all. Any advice would be highly appreciated. Thank you in advance"

Wouldn't be surprised if it'll be less when I visit my doctor again tomorrow. \n\nI think I might have GERD, hypertension, pancreatitis, vision problems--seeing floating stars or black dots, and a blue dot in the corner of my eye and diabetes. I tried eating some oranges and blue berries today and yesterday, but now I feel strange. I don't know if I'm just panicking and making it worse, but it feels like my side hurts. Not only that but I'm experiencing chest pain (?), like I can't feel my heartbeat or I'll jolt up randomly if I try to sleep.\n\nI've lost weight, have difficulty breathing and chest pain, numbness in my arm at times but it goes away, and bowel movement difficulty. I think it could be a mixture of GERD and diabetes and heart disease. I recently started eating though, a bowl of white rice and chicken is all I eat and that's been like four times this past week. I've gone a whole week without eating about three weeks ago, then three days last week and two and a half days this week. I'm really afraid to eat, I constantly check to see if it has too much sodium or sugar and that makes it hard to eat. I'm also terrified of getting a heart attack or stroke because I have to keep checking my pulse or chest, just to make sure I have a beat. Yesterday, however, it didn't feel like I did. \n\nI already have an appointment with a cardiologist in September, hopefully I can convince my doctor to help me get a MRI and put a camera down my throat to see if I have stomach problems too. \n\nDoes anyone know what I could have? I feel like it's multiple diseases, but no one seems to care. My doctor said it couldn't be cancer because something about my blood platelets were normal or my white blood cells, but that doesn't explain my weight loss or vision problems. Another doctor said I couldn't have heart disease or heart defects because every ekg test came back normal, but that still doesn't explain my chest pain or breathing."

        "reddit": "I'm hoping that sharing some information with this community may help me help my Dad. I'll try to keep things brief, but I want to share as much information as possible in hopes that help may follow as result. \n\nI created a new account for this post. \n\nPlease read this post in full:\n\nA few weeks ago (late July 2019), my Dad (58yo) was at work and suddenly wasn't making sense while speaking. He was extremely confused, didn't know his name and his words weren't complete or even real words. Immediately thinking these were signs of a stroke, an ambulance was called. \n\nAfter receiving a few tests (various blood work and a CT scan) it was determined that he did not have a stroke in any way. He was released from the hospital. My uncle and his wife were at the hospital with him (I live 3 hours away) and they brought his car for him. They left and he called shortly (minutes) after complaining \"there's something in my head, there's something in my head\". My uncle and his wife turned around, picked him and his car up and brought him to their house. They kept him comfortable for the evening and went to bed. They chalked up his early comments to it just having been a long and emotional day. When they woke up, both he and his car were gone. \n\nMy Dad drove back to his house (approx 45 minute drive) and cut both his wrists early in the morning following his first hospital visit. Just prior to doing so, he unlocked his front door (he never keeps it unlocked) and called 911. The paramedics were able to quickly enter the house and save his life even though we had lost a significant amount of blood.\n\nMy Dad stayed in intensive care for 7 days (he received approx 20 staples in each wrist) and then was admitted to the psychiatric ward. **He does not remember hurting himself and denies wanting to ever hurt himself**.\n\nA brief summary of my Dad's history:\n\n* My parents divorced 25 years ago - he had another relationship (6 years or so) but never really anything more serious than that\n* He was \"the man\" at work for a number of years (in sales) and lost his job and a re-structuring move (early 2000s) - he never really found his groove again or the income he once had\n* He became extremely introverted and pushed away most friends and family\n* He lives alone and rarely attends any type of social gathering\n* Both my sister and I have had on and off again relationships with him - mostly due to him pushing us out of his life\n* He developed Rheumatoid Arthritis which progressed fast enough to cause his knuckles to swell and his fingers are now permanently pushing outwards\n* He developed a 5+ year dependency on Tylenol for this (10+ pills at once...multiple times per day)\n* This dependency caused him to lose significant weight due to always feeling sick (went from 190lbs to 140lbs over a few years)\n\nMy Dad has lived an unhealthy lifestyle for a quite some time (both mentally and physically) and **depression has been a factor in his life for a number of years.**  \n\n* He would constantly repeat himself \n* He would constantly be forgetful\n* His mood swings were always quite dramatic\n* He never really cared about anything\n* In the months leading up to his first hospital visit - he lost an additional 20lbs (he is currently 6'0\" and 120lbs)\n* I could write a book full of other details - but this is where I'm trying to keep things brief\n\nAfter his suicide attempt and spending an additional week in psychiatric care, the psychiatrist informed me that he finally admitted remorse for his actions. He was showing improvement to the point where he was fine to be released (I guess?). He is now living with my uncle full time and it under constant supervision.\n\nThe doctor sent him home with an assortment of anti-depressants:\n\n* 10mg Escitalopram\n* 30mg Mirtazapine\n* 0.25 Pramipexole Dihydrochloride\n\nI've done my best to educate myself on this medication, but it's all very new to me. \n\nSo far - since my Dad's suicide attempt and him starting this medication I've noticed the following :\n\n* You can talk to him, but it's often like \"nobody is home\". He stares right through the person speaking to him\n* Conversations remain simple, anything beyond the weather or what's on TV confuses him\n* He's not retaining many thoughts\n* He has played guitar his whole life - and now he can't remember the song after only a few chords\n* He is extremely emotional - he starts crying in the middle of a sentence and the next sentence is like nothing ever happened\n* He wanders around and is often confused\n* He isn't sleeping very well (he hasn't ever really been a good sleeper...)\n* He eats very little unless he is reminded to eat\n\n**A few days ago (Saturday) we had a great visit together and he seemed more or less like his old self. We watched a movie, he took his meds on time and slept all night. Sunday morning he woke up and the following occurred:**\n\n* Within 10 minutes of being awake my Dad sat at the table put his head down\n* He immediately begin yelling pure jiborish (I can't even compare it to any language)\n* This lasted 10 minutes without a break - his eyes were wide open and he wasn't responding to anything\n* (Ambulance was called)\n* He then got up and mentioned how nice the grass smells\n* He then lost function of both legs and collapsed (I caught him)\n* He called me by a friends name the whole time (he hasn't seen or heard from this friend in 20+ years)\n\nWe got the hospital where additional tests were performed. **There is no sign of any brain mass, tumor or vein blockage.** By the time the doctor's had run their tests (approx 3 hours from the initial event that morning) he had returned to his normal self again. He did not have any memory of any of this occurring. He was sent back to my Uncle's where he has been fine ever since.\n\nA few things I'm trying to figure out:\n\n* **His current diagnosis is Severe Depressive Disorder** \\- depression makes sense...but does that explain his initial \"mind lapse\" prior to his suicide attempt\n* **He still denies ever wanting to commit suicide and doesn't remember doing it**\n* **How can the episode on Sunday be explained? Is this a side effect of the anti-depressants?**\n* **Could this potentially be dementia?** The way has mind has been eroding seems way too quick for someone dealing with depression. I'm not an expert by any means, but can depression cause the initial confusion and inability to speak?\n\nIf have so many questions. Has anyone else experienced this? Are there any Redditors educated in this area that can offer any advice? What else should I be getting him tested for?\n\nI love my Dad with all my heart and want get him as comfortable as possible. Any help you can offer will be greatly and forever appreciated."

It was a very stressful time for me and my family. I was told not to tell anyone about what was going on, so I distanced myself from my friends and kept it all to myself. I became apathetic towards school, which I used to enjoy. I was filled with stress and worry from the minute I woke up, and I found myself unwilling to get out of bed most days. I became 'numb' - I couldn't name what my feelings were, what was important to me, what my future plans or aspirations were, or even describe who I was. I often felt like what was going on was so nightmarish that it couldn't be real. I started to dream up scenarios in which I would get beaten up or kill myself because I found it comforting to think that I'd die soon. Happily, I can confidently say that, while I do experience 'lows' that last for several months, I'm not as 'low' as I used to be and no longer think about suicide.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI started taking methotrexate in August 2017. In January 2018, I noticed that I felt exhausted even though I wasn't 'sad', and despite the fact that I wasn't doing anything physically strenuous during the day. In fact, I was putting a lot of effort into looking after myself: I was getting 8-10 hours of sleep per day, I'd increase my fruit and vegetable intake and exercising daily. I was taking 1-3 naps daily and was even falling asleep in classes. I chalked the exhaustion down to RA because I wasn't feeling low at the time. My mood started to decline in April 2018 when my RA got worse; I had a lot of stiffness and/or inflmmation in most of my joints, especially in my neck and knee, and I felt like I was often trying to fight a cold. By July, my join pain/stiffness had calmed down a little, but my fatigue was worse. I recognised then that I was feeling low and I wasn't sure anymore whether it was due to the RA or not.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy questions are:\n\n1. I've tried going to a councellor several times this year to try to figure out how I can manage my stress and fatigue better and each time I went, I spent most of the hour crying. I often felt slightly worse after each session because I had to remember and talk about the past. What should I expect from a councellor? Do councellors generally help people with the problems I'm having? What does 'help' even look like?\n2. I've not told my GP (general practice doctor/family medicine doctor) about the depression\\* or fatigue because I feel like that would force me to tell him about the whole family violence situation, which would be problematic because he treats most of my family, including my dad. Is there any harm in him not knowing about the depression\\*? What would happen if I did tell him? I'm scared of what the repercussions may be if I tell him because, as I said before, my family has made it clear that they don't want anyone to know. Also, I'm scared that he'll treat me differently because he gets along with my parents (he's treated me since I was a kid).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you to anyone who reads or responds to this, and thank you to the moderators for this sub."

He stumbled into my little brothers(12) room to wake him up and get help.  An ambulance came, and the paramedics initially thought it was a heart attack, however they managed to bring him back to normal.  He ended up staying a whole week in the hospital due to being exhausted from it.  The doctors came to the conclusion that it was an atrial fibrillation due to his anxiety.  He had many tests, which all came back normal including scans on his legs for any blood clots.  They started him on tablets, Aspirin, and some others Im not sure of.  Eventually after about a month he didnt feel exhausted, and just about back to normal, occasionally having episodes of exhaustion that came spasmodically every few days.  However until Saturday(3 days ago), he had another episode like the very first one, however not as severe but still needing an ambulance and was discharged out of the hospital the day after.  His tests were normal.  He then had another one today, feeling tingling in his hands, an exhausted feeling and got another ambulance.  Again it wasnt as severe, but still very worring.  He is in the hospital right now, and apparently since Saturday his Phosphate levels are down quite a bit.  I am currently at university 6 hours away, but still feeling very worried for him and his health.  Does anyone have any idea on his condition? Doctors cant seem to work it out.  Sorry for the very poorly written post, Im just grasping at straws at the moment."

Since it's not entirely debilitating, I haven't always made fixing it my biggest priority, but it's getting worse. Another symptom is often being thirsty and peeing a lot at night (no diabetes and ok prostate).\n\nAfter doing some regular blood tests with my GP, everything came back perfect, so she referred me to an endocrinologist. After ordering a special blood test, the endocrinologist saw that my pituitary gland is underproducing hormones. In the results they are still within the clinical range, but barely above the minimum, so I was ordered an MRI scan of the pituitary gland.\n\nThe scan results say: \"Impression of a slightly less contrasting area of the pituitary gland about 0.3 cm in diameter, which might correspond to the pituitary microadenoma, dynamic control recommended.\", which could or could not be a benign tumor, but more importantly it also says:\n\n\"Nasal sinuses pneumatized, thickened, swollen mucosa in both maxillary cavities, more pronounced basal and more pronounced on right side, occasionally mucosal edema in ethmoidal cells, mucosal edema in left sphenoid cavity and bilaterally. Mastoid cells are pneumatized without abnormal findings.\"\n\n(Text in quotes is Google translated because the original is not in English, but I think it's clear.)\n\nWhen I showed this to the endocrinologist, she said it's nothing to worry about. That surprised me. My GP is currently ill herself so I can't see her immediately, therefore decided to post here.

Recurrence &amp; remission periods have a virtually rythmic pattern: 1/4 of each month is allocated to remission, while during the other 3/4 of the month, the two main symptoms vary in intensity in function of the presence of anxiety triggering events. Symptomatic progression is felt more in intensity than in periodicity. The consequences of these symptoms on my well-being extend from physical discomfort to cognitive numbness (paying attention on a single task such as reading or listening is difficult).\n\n**History**\n\nI was a healthy child. Entering puberty, I maintained a relatively healthy lifestyle: two compulsory hours per week were allocated to sport during high-school; let's add a few others for skateboarding and bowling - I developped some issues with my right scapula because of it. Mid-puberty marked the beginning of a more sedentary lifestyle; I developped the usual *gamer syndrome* with oblique back posture and vision loss, but kept an overall good physical shape. Because of this period, I developped a minor scoliosis.\n\nI changed life, country, fell in love &amp; fell into cocaine at 19; intense 3 months period during which I consumed weekly, mixing with Ritalin, way above the recommended dosages. I went cold-turkey after experiencing heart-attack symptoms during a session (numbness of the chin and left-arm, dyspnea and arythmia).\n\nI managed to overcome the basic psychological withdrawal symptoms i.e craving but, on the other hand, I progressively started experiencing the dyspnea after two weeks. A month after, the acute back pain appeared; strangely, it felt good for it was a pain that I could locate in contrary to the dyspnea back-pressure symptoms; it made me suffocate at its paroxysm.\n\nThe most difficult psychological withdrawal symptoms I had to face - and still have, on a minor scale - was hypochondria. I started to get delusional, thinking I contracted some kind of myocarditis from my drug abuse. Now, I usually never went to the doctor until recently because they never helped me with my physical problems.\n\n**Acupuncture**\n\n6 months in, I took an appointment with an acupuncturist. Everything went fine *until* he put a niddle above the midal rhomboid major (I would say above the medial third rib). I never experienced such a pain. I screamed and they were not with me in the room anymore. I was never stabbed in my life, but I really felt as if a sharp blade penetrated the area between the scapula and T3, towards my heart. I cried in the end and went home.\n\n**Doctor visits** (2)\n\nAfter the acupuncture experience, I understood that there was something definitely wrong with my back. I went to the doctor in France, he said everything was right with my heartbeat. No diagnostics. I went to the doctor in the Netherlands, he said everything was right with my heartbeat; however, I was little bit tense on the left part of my back.\n\n**Definitions of symptoms**\n\n1. Chronic dyspnea and overall back pressure: *Daily; starts when I wake up. It feels like there is something around T3 that blocks my breath to quench my lungs. Belly breathing is not a problem, but I have to chest breath in order to be fullfilled. I am always fullfilled once, then I can not get fullfilled before the next minute. When I feel relax - meditation -, I take a deep breath and something regularly snaps around T3; sometimes it hurts, sometimes it doesn't. At the paroxysm of this first symptom I am on the ground, suffocating and striving for air. I can not pay attention to anything.*\n2. The acute *postcordal catch-type* pain: *Seldom; 1 to 2 times a month. More often during anxiety triggering events. Not triggered by any peculiar postures, it is sudden and intense; I can't move nor breath when it occurs. It lasts 1 to 2 minutes. Often occurs at the end of the first symptom at its paroxysm.*\n\n**Final words**\n\nEveryday I allocate two hours of my time to just understand why I suffer this kind of pain. I want to go back to the university but I am scared I won't pass my class because I just can't pay attention when I can't reach for air. It is impacting my social and professionnal life. I can not run anymore, nor do competitive sport. I have a healthy diet. I don't consume any drugs. Yoga helped me a lot, but at the end of the remissions, it always comes stronger. It really annoys me to suffer daily while in the eyes of a doctor, I am a healthy guy; sometimes I just want to stab me in the back as a reflex to the discomfort. Please help me if you distinguish some kind of syndrom.\n\nThank you.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPS: I have more precise definitions of my symptoms. You can PM me if you are interested."

The issue:\n\nOn July 30 morning the diarrhea and vomiting started. Zero fever, no sign of dehydration.\n\nDiarrhea is usually 5 to 6 diapers with yellow stool, full of mucus, bad smell. We had 2 diapers with some spots of blood (red, as strawberry jam drops in the middle of apricot jam) but they were outliers.\n\nThe vomiting is in the morning (3 vomits within an hour, not projectile, usually with pieces of food from a meal from 12 hours ago, can't know the color for sure because it usually has breast milk or soy milk partially digested). This has happened every 6 or 7 days (vomits for 1 or 2 days, and it stops). Feels cyclical. During those days he is also very low energy and sometimes he looks like is feeling pain during the day.\n\nDiarrhea was: 9 bad days, one kinda good, other 5 bad days. Them we decided ourselves to cut breastfeeding (BF) thinking about temporary lactose intolerance. We cut BF for 3 days and had better diapers, decided to BF again and had vomiting/diarrhea; cut BF again, better to normal diapers (3 days). We thought that the lactose intolerance was the issue until today, when he vomited 3 times and had diarrhea even though he was not BF for those 3 days. The days with better diapers he looks totally happy and eats like a mad man. Days with just diarrhea he eats normally.\n\nWe went to our GP 2 times already (at 8 days and at 17 days sick) both times she said the abdominal touch test was ok, asked for a stool sample to test for parasites and bacteria, checked the ears and throat and it was ok, lungs ok. Both tests came clean. No further tests asked.\n\nThe reason why I'm asking here: during the last time at the appointment the GP said if the test came back normal again that I should contact his pediatrician, I contacted the pedi and her assistant said to come back to the GP saying it still could be just the stomach flu (for 3 weeks and with cyclical vomiting, can it be?). I didn't talk to the doc though, just her assistant on the phone. So I was wondering what can I ask for my GP to investigate further (Dutch doctors have this culture of asking what we feel it might be too...) since not only I feel this has been too long, but also seems like he is losing weight.\n\n9. Medical history:\n\n\\- diagnosed with eczema from 5 months old until 13 months old, redness all over the body, itchiness, flaking. We used hydrocortisone cream plus one with tar from 7 months old until 11 months old (5 days in 3 out). The rash started going away by itself around 1 year old and we didn't use the cream ever since.\n\n\\- Growth problems (height and weight) from 7 months old until 1 year and 3 months old (he fell off the charts). A pediatrician started to investigate when he was 13 months old (took us a while to get the referral).  She said she found nothing relevant at his abdomen ultrasound and blood tests (besides a little low ph and something else I don't remember). We described two episodes of an allergic reaction to dairy (7 months old and 12 months old) and she tested for cow milk protein allergy in a double-blinded test, it was positive and severe. Important to say: besides the test and introductions at home he doesn't consume dairy and the mother (me) who breastfeeds doesn't consume since he was 10 months old too (we decided to stop by ourselves since we feel that was causing the eczema).\n\n\\-Since 15 months old he started growing a little again, parallel to his old curve (was 15%, not in the charts now).\n\n10. Current medications: No\n\n11. Family history:\n\n\\- Grandfather from father side is epileptic\n\n\\- Grandfather from mother side is asthmatic and hypertense\n\n\\-Aunts were all asthmatic when kids and one has sinusitis\n\n\\-Father has psoriasis\n\n12. Other\n\n\\-he has no contact with other children or animals, but he's a kid, he eats dirt from the ground all the time.\n\n\\-he has taken his rotavirus vaccination (RotaTeq, all 3 doses)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSorry for the long description, I guess better be detailed than not. Thanks a lot :)"

I was getting ready for a basketball tournament and I got in the shower, a few minutes later, the same weird feeling came back and the spots, the vision going black, and not being able to move happened. This time, I could hear things more clearly during all this but I didn\u2019t actually know what was being said. My parents took me in to the ER when I woke up and they determined it was \u201ca normal teenage girl problem.\u201d Thankfully my parents didn\u2019t believe that and I went to my pediatrician the next day. However, he said the same thing. He said that teenage girls can be sensitive to hot water. 1) I was very well hydrated as I was in the middle of a tournament and 2) I was taking a cold shower to wake up. So that was an unexplained episode. \n\nIn high school, I ran a cross country meet and started feeling funky the minute I started. I got a horrible time and sat down after the race because I was so tired and drained feeling, I had never felt so horrible in my life. I was sitting there and I started getting spacey. Apparently my friend\u2019s mom came up to me and tried to speak to me but I wasn\u2019t making sense and I told her I was sick, luckily she\u2019s a nurse and she thought I was having heat stroke (on a 65 degree day...) but she called an ambulance and laid me down, she was doing everything she could to snap me out of it. Then I started shaking. Not like a seizure, but I was shivering all over and it didn\u2019t stop for 15 minutes. I don\u2019t remember anything. Apparently I was speaking and awake but when I felt like I finally snapped out of it, there was a giant crowd and it was a huge deal and I couldn\u2019t even remember where I was. The medics cleared me there and didn\u2019t even recommend going to the hospital. Luckily, my friend\u2019s mom, the nurse, told my parents to take me because something was wrong. They took me to the ER and they blamed it on dehydration. I was in and out of the ER for a week because the following days I was vomiting, I was having similar episodes that would just happen after doing nothing or just walking to the bathroom. I was so sick for about a week and then I was back to being a normal healthy kid. \n\nWhen I turned 18, another similar thing happened to the first two episodes and I went to my pediatrician and he blamed it on being a girl again. That\u2019s when I decided to seek a better doctor. It had been three years and nothing had happened, then I went to Europe for a few weeks. I came home and I was so sick. I thought I was actually dying one day. I had a really high fever, my back hurt, I was sweating and vomiting. They determined I had a kidney infection, but then later determined it wasn\u2019t and they didn\u2019t know what was wrong. This is the time that everything got really bad. I was literally fainting on a frequent basis and the fatigue was getting so bad some days I couldn\u2019t move. I was vomiting randomly and my heart rate goes crazy when I\u2019m up and moving. My blood pressure is always low and I\u2019ve been through dozens of tests where they can\u2019t find anything. Every doctor says I appear to be a healthy young woman but they believe that there is something going on inside of me. I have been bouncing between doctors and specialists trying to figure it out. I\u2019ve been hospitalized, so many ER visits, doctors office visits almost weekly. \n\nI\u2019m 22 and trying to get back to my \u201cnormal\u201d life, or maybe a life I haven\u2019t experienced yet. It\u2019s gotten so bad I can\u2019t run anymore, I can\u2019t rock climb or hike much either. My hobbies have been stripped and I had to quit track my sophomore year of college because I had an episode at practice one too many times. \n\nI have been put on midodrine and fludrocortisone in an attempt to help the low blood pressure but neither worked, just made me gain some weight. Currently off medication. \n\nIf anyone has any ideas, literally anything, please reach out to me. I\u2019m desperate."

        "reddit": "I\u2019m a 17 year old male who recently went in for an annual sports physical. My normal doctor is currently on vacation so I had the appointment with a different woman who I had never met before. Normally when I have an appointment my doctor has my mom leave the room before she asks me personal questions about sexual history, orientation, drug use, mental health, etc. but the new doctor asked me all these questions with my mom present in the room. When she began asking about past drug use I got uncomfortable because the truth is I have tried marijuana in the past school year but I didn\u2019t feel comfortable admitting that in front of my mom so I ended up lying and saying no. I feel bad about lying to a doctor because I know I shouldn\u2019t do that but I didn\u2019t feel like having THAT conversation with my mom on the way home. When it got to be time to check my testicles for hernias that\u2019s when I finally asked if my mom could step outside but the doctor insisted that she needed to be in the room as a \u201cchaperone\u201d. I told her that ever since I became a teenager my usual doctor has always asked my mom to leave for the check, but she told me that since I was a minor she legally needs my mom to be present, and if my regular doctor has had my mom leave then she was \u201cbending the rules\u201d. So that\u2019s where I put my foot down because let\u2019s be real, I\u2019m 17 and don\u2019t feel like taking my pants off in front of my mom. The doc told me that I didn\u2019t have to do the check, but in order for her to be able to clear me for sports I had to have it done, and for her to be able to do it my mom has to be a witness since I\u2019m underage. My mom got annoyed with me and told me to stop whining and just do it, so after much arguing I finally relented and just let the doc check me in full view of her, and it was just as uncomfortable as I predicted.\n\nSo basically my essential question is was the doctor right there? I was under the impression that at my age I could give my own consent for stuff like that. She insisted that my normal doctor would have been \u201cbending the rules\u201d if she performed a checkup without my mom there, but that doesn\u2019t seem right to me. I\u2019ve donated blood in the past at school without my parent\u2019s permission, and I just seems odd that I\u2019d be able to consent to that on my own but not to have my own testicles checked by a medical professional. It\u2019s just something I\u2019m curious about for future reference and any and all information would be appreciated.\n\nThanks!"

I'm wordy, but I think the details are relevant.\n\nSo sometimes I've had a very small amount of bright red blood on the toilet paper. It tends to coincide with a harder stool after I've been constipated for a couple of days, or if I eat something that doesn't break down well like corn. I told my GI doc about it and she said if it's bright red and not \"in\" the stool, then it's typically hemorrhoids or fissures and nothing to worry about. She said to call if it was a large volume of blood, blood is black or darker in color, if I experience shocking pain, or anything else I find alarming.\n\nWell today, I went to the bathroom and I noticed in some of the mucus that came out (this is fairly common for me, to have a small amount of mucus), there were two tiny blood clots. They were bright red in color, but looked fibrous which is why I say they're probably clots. I menstruate, so I feel comfortable with that assessment.\n\nI noticed this happen after I peed earlier and felt my colon contract like it was gonna have me poop. I knew the poop wasn't ready, so I waited a little longer and then went back to the bathroom, at which point these clots occurred.\n\nMy theory is that my contracting colon put pressure on hard stool that caused a small bleed like it normally would, but because I didn't empty my colon right then, it had about 10-20 minutes to clot in my mucus. Does that sound like a stupid theory?\n\nShould I call my GI doc and mention the small clots or is this something that can happen with hemorrhoids and fissures? I'm not experiencing anything else out of the ordinary, but I get nervous about my health and I don't know if this is considered \"alarming\".\n\nI have never had significant bleeding, only a few dots on TP or a light \"smear\" on the TP after a harsh wipe.  This seems like it would be par for the course with IBS, but I need to hear that from someone else or I will lose sleep.\n\nThanks in advance for reading about my bowel movements.

        "reddit": "TL;DR: Recently we took the baby to her 12 months appointment and expected 4 shots. The doctor asked us to choose a vaccine to do at this visit. We had no idea how to choose and asked to do as scheduled. Ended up getting MMR and Varicella, the next appointment is planned next month for the next shot. WTF?\n\n## Some history\n\nAt the two months visit it is normal that the child receives 3 vaccines (hexavac, pneumo, rotavirus). Our doctor suggested to spread the vaccines and come for some at 3 months. After insisting that we want to get the vaccines according to schedule (see below) we got the three vaccines (2 injections, 1 oral). Same story at the 4 month visit. And by the 6 month visit she recalled that we go according to the schedule and just gave the two shots.\n\nNote that we've had no vaccination or immunosystem related issues that would ask for an alternative schedule. It seems that she just has her own \"softer\" schedule that she offers by default.\n\nI had read publications that caving in to parent pressure and spreading shots is bad because it leads to prolonged risks. And it leads to more planned visits which cause more missed visits and missed vaccines. And I had read that administering particular vaccines (MMR/MMRV I think at a later age causes more complications). And I had read that the only risk increase of vaccines taken together is when it's MMRV instead of separate MMR and Varicella. And that's why those shots are scheduled separate.\n\nI felt pretty confident telling that we want the vaccines according to schedule and we don't need them spread.\n\n\n## The issue and questions\n\nWe arrive at the 12 months visit and after some routine checks the doctor starts explaining that now the big vaccination course starts. We'll have to have varicella, measles, combined, pneumo and also the tick one is discounted if we do it before we hit 2 years of age. Which one shall we do? She suggests measles as there was some outbreak in Lithuania (a neighbouring country) recently.\n\nMe and my wife were stunned. We had no such knowledge to choose among vaccines. We were under the impression that there is a schedule and we just stick to it. I pick up the baby's vaccination passport and look at schedule on the back - it schedules for shots at \"12-15 months\". Damn, what does that mean? Is it actually intended to be split up? Or is it one session somewhere in that age interval?\n\n\"Can we simply get the scheduled vaccines?\" my wife spoke up. The doctor asked if we want to do the tick one, I told her we'd start with the mandatory vaccines and think about ticks later, maybe preparing for the next season. So what shots can we get now? \"I won't give you more than two injections at once\" she proclaimed. She went to nurse and told her to prepare Varicella as well - the parents want more than one already. Thus we got MMR and Varicella.\n\nThis nurse had the expressions, behaviours and comments \"oh poor baby, so many shots at once\" like she usually does. Just pointing out as that seems to indicate the shot-spreading culture at their place.\n\nNow I have some questions. What was supposed to happen - all shots or 1 by 1 every month? What should I have done - fight the doctor, trust the doctors suggestions or go home to research before answering and vaccinating the baby? What should I do now - insist on all the remaining shots next visit, change doctor or what?\n\nTYVM if you managed to read my ranting.\n\n## Supplementary: Vaccination schedule in Latvia\n\n- 0-12 hours: HepB (if the mother is HB positive or untested)\n- from 12 hours: tuberculosis\n- from 6 weeks: rotavirus (must be completed until the age of 6 months - usually one vaccination at 2, 4 and 6 month visits)\n- 2 months: Hexavac (DTaP-IPV-Hib-HepB) and Pneumo (PCV)\n- 4 months: Hexavac and Pneumo\n- 6 months: Hexavac\n- 6 to 23 months: seasonal flu\n- 12-15 months: Hexavac, Pneumo, MMR, Varicella\n- [optional &amp; not free] Tick-borne encephalitis with 50% discount up to 2 years old\n- 7 years: DTaP-IPV, MMR, Varicella\n- 12 years: HPV\n- 14 years: Td-IPV\n\n## The mandatory stuff\n\nAge: 1\n\nSex: Lady\n\nHeight: 75,5 m\n\nWeight: 9,5 kg\n\nRace: White\n\nDuration of complaint: 15 minutes (1 visit)\n\nLocation (Geographic and on body): Latvia\n\nAny existing relevant medical issues (if any): Never had any vaccination related issues\n\nCurrent medications (if any): Got MMR and Varicella shots\n\nInclude a photo if relevant (skin condition for example): https://imgur.com/HFGiV5T (not relevant, it just picks up dirty sticks and eats microbes like mad)"

I must have hit an artery or sizable vein, as the wound started gushing blood a half inch or so with every heartbeat. I thought I\u2019d probably have to go to the ER, but after compressing for about 20 minutes the bleeding slowed to a trickle. I washed the cut with soap and water and hydrogen peroxide, applied antibiotic ointment, and wrapped it with a bandage.\n\nToday the wound is pretty much sealed together and just looks like a half inch long purple line. I\u2019d estimate the depth of the puncture at 1/2\u201d-3/4\u201d. I have pain at the site and there is some swelling and considerable bruising on my palm and wrist. I can move all my fingers without pain so I\u2019m guessing I escaped any significant nerve or tendon damage.\n\nSo my main concern now is risk for infection.

You have to give the military medical facility a chance to see you and then you can request to see a civilian if your PCM authorizes it, all while waiting 28 days each time to get an appointment. \n\nMy symptoms right now include joint pain (specifically in left knee and finger joints), muscle aches, fatigue, low grade temps (100.5 or less controlled with motrin tylenol), acute lip swelling intermittently (angioedema- dr calls it that?), muscle weakness, heat/cold/ sun intolerance, dry eyes, easy bruising, dry lips, calf cramps at night, bone pain in left shin, purple and tingly toes unless I wake them up. \n\nHere\u2019s what\u2019s been going on: \nIn 2017 I had pneumonia twice and strep A once but I was a huge fitness person and thought it was due to military + school and stress. Then in 2018 I started having very bloody stools. Randomly, not all the time. And for about a 3 month period where I just felt terrible. Like the flu had never gone away, and I was just in this fog. I had a colonoscopy, they said it was probably hemorrhoids (the blood didn\u2019t look like it at all, this was a good amount of blood with clots in it. I have taken pictures of everything) but didn\u2019t find any evidence of it. Told me to take iron supplements due to low iron and miralax to combat the constipation from that. \n\n2019- this has been the hardest year physically of my entire life and I am at a complete loss for what to do. I feel like I am crazy or I\u2019m going to be to that point soon. I have had 8 documented, UTIs to date. 2 kidney infections (requiring overnight hospitalization) stemming from the UTIs and my resistance to the antibiotics prescribed ( The bacteria are now resistent to 2 UTI meds). I had strep throat B which I guess is less common than A, 3 times and treated with antibiotics. And 3 cases of high (103+ F) fevers with viral pharyngitis. Every sick instance is recorded in my record. For the past 6-7 months I have felt not myself, fatigued, easily tired, and just exhausted. Now the past 3 weeks, my muscles are so sore. I\u2019m moving slowly, I\u2019m having a horrible time sleeping, morning stiffness and I\u2019ve been crying in the morning as my spouse helps me put on my uniform to go in for muster ( I am now on non working status due to appointments / trying to figure out what\u2019s going on). I have had poor concentration and forgetfulness but I feel like this is due to the crappy sleep. In the past month, I\u2019ve lost 19.8 lbs. I\u2019m not hungry, I\u2019m irritable, and this past weekend I had pain in my groin where the lymph nodes were slightly swollen and tender. \n\nHere\u2019s where it gets shitty: the doctors are doing the workups and unfortunately in the military there isn\u2019t much continuity of care. I just got a PCP who I\u2019ve now had for about 2 months who is really trying to figure out what\u2019s going on here. Before him, I saw one doctor at sick-call (our morning version of urgent care) who put in my chart that he thought I was malingering since my temp was only 99.5 and I tested negative for flu. Instead of asking me about symptoms, he asked me first what my career goals were and also said it seemed as if I had been sick a lot recently and that hurts deployment numbers. I have been seeing a therapist for the past year about every 2-3 weeks due to coping with the death of a family member and she thought this was insanity and actually helped me get the PCP I have now at the same military facility. But I still feel like the other doctor putting that in my chart has hurt me when seeing specialists. For the past year I\u2019ve had a moderately-low lymphocyte count, a high Creatine Kinase count (have been referred to neuromuscular and awaiting a appointment, it was around upper 500s?), steadily moderately-high WBC (11-13k) but correlating with illnesses. I saw urology, had a scope done. They confirmed blood in the urine, but said nothing concerning in my bladder region. They sent me to rheumatology and the provider said she didn\u2019t think I had anything that fits into a criteria right now and didn\u2019t want to diagnose me with fibermyalgia because she thought it could steer away finding what the issue could possibly be. I really thought I might have lupus, but my ANA came back negative. \n\nI just saw my PCP yesterday who was very concerned about my vitals and weight loss (have been having high HR 110-115, bp was 99/57) and ordered another series of labs. He called neuromuscular to speed up the getting an appointment and he also noted my feet\u2019s color and slight edema. \n\nNeuromuscular is my last hope here and I\u2019m just exhausted, physically and mentally and I\u2019d give anything to go back to working out, hiking with my dog and husband, and just completing normal errands without feeling exhausted beyond belief. If any of you have any advice, thoughts on what it could be, care to see photos, please let me know! \n\nI appreciate it beyond belief. Worst case scenario is, we take out civilian health insurance for me to see a provider there and start the process all over again :( \n\n\nAddition: I was seen by infectious disease and had tested pos for having had Epstein Barr in the past but I am neg for every other infectious diseases (HIV, Herpes, Hep B, etc)\n\nAnother addition: My biological father and paternal aunt have rare autoimmune diseases (Dad- Dermatimyocitis and Aunt- Hashimotos)"

About 5 hours later, I experienced intense dizziness, confusion, chills, nausea, and disorientation. These symptoms lasted approximately 5-6 hours before dissipating.

        "reddit": "I already posted about this to /r/DiagnoseMe, but I feel like I might get answers here quicker since the community is larger.\n\nI'm 22 years old and went through a major depression period during the last 4-3 years. During this time I spent most of my time in bed and in front of my computer, and did **absolutely nothing** for my physical health. I've had depression for 8 years and have never really been into working out, but before the past major depression period, I at least did something resembling exercise.  \nNow I have finally found my joy of living again, but I fear that joy is already crumbling down.\n\nSome needed facts before getting into the story:\n\n\u2022 I'm 22 and a female  \n\u2022 due to gender dysphoria, I have worn a binder for the past 3 years. I always take it off when I'm at home.  \n\u2022 caucasian  \n\u2022 I'm 167 cm  \n\u2022 my weight is probably somewhere around 90 - 100kg, I gained a lot of weight during depression  \n\u2022 don't smoke  \n\u2022 drink maybe a couple of times a year\n\nI'm an artist and got accepted into my dream art school, but while drawing my pre-exam tests felt some strain in my right forearm. Now, this is very common among people who use the computer or draw a lot, so I wasn't too worried about that at first. I decided to just rest it and let it heal.  \nBut the pain kept increasing and I decided to see a doctor who told me to rest for two weeks and I also got a prescription for some medicine that should help with the infection she suspected was causing my problems.  \nAt this point the strain and pain were so bad that I needed to do everything with my left hand. Doing anything with my right hand or the whole arm was painful, and the whole arm felt incredibly tired.\n\nAfter these two weeks, the strain had gotten better and the pain was gone, but I still wasn't feeling my 100%, so I met up with a physiotherapist who gave me very helpful tips on how to prevent this injury in the future, and also gave me a green light to get back to my usual activities.  \nI went home full of excitement to draw again, but just after one evening of very chill drawing with stretching and work-out breaks every 30 minutes my forearm relapsed.\n\nAfter that I have picked up daily yoga, stopped drawing completely, stretch every 30-45 minutes when on the computer, and nothing helped.\n\nAfter 2 months passed I slowly felt myself going insane, for a lack of a better word. That's the longest time ever in my life without drawing and I can actually feel it affecting my mental health. Every person has that one outlet and a thing they have a burning passion for, and art is mine.  \nA couple of weeks ago I took my last bit of savings and went to see a chiropractor who is one of the best in where I live in. She found multiple very tense deep muscles and helped to relax them, and after seeing her 4 times I was actually getting hopeful that my ordeal was finally over. She was very confident that we had found the root of the problem, and that now that school starts I should be able to use my hand almost normally already. She explained that my strain injury wasn't a common one (something I had already figured out since a normal strain injury should heal in about two weeks), and that all the strain and lack of movement during the past years was simply just too much for my body. But in her opinion, I should start seeing results very quickly and could say goodbye for the strain.\n\nBut during my first week of school I had to use the computer to edit videos for a couple of hours, and the pain and strain returned again. It's still very bad and I am beyond frustrated and terrified that my dreams of becoming a professional artist are destroyed.\n\nSome more information about the pain and issue: when I rotate my right elbow and the right side of my upper back it doesn't move freely. It feels like two broken cogwheels trying to rotate. While rotating it also lets out a noise as if someone just stepped on a bag of uncooked pasta. My right-arm bicep muscles also feel very odd. I simply can't put it into words but in certain arm positions it feels like the muscle moves in a very unnatural way, a way in which I can't move my left bicep muscle at all. This also causes pain.  \n\n\nAt this point, I don't really know what to do anymore. My right forearm gets still strained from the smallest things and my whole right arm just always feels tired and very tense.  \nIf anyone has any tips or advice I'm more than happy to hear them all. Thank you."

        "reddit": "Hi,\n\nI first noticed this about 3 weeks back. I'll give some background first. I got out of the shower (had used a loofah) and when drying myself I noticed a couple of flecks of blood just under my skin beginning to form. They were not in a cluster, they were spread out across my upper arm on both arms. No bigger than 1mm. I figured this was caused by the loofah so I decided I'd stop using that if it was going to damage the skin. I'm quite pale and always have been so I also thought that maybe my complexion was making them more noticeable. In fact, you probably couldn't even notice them unless you were intentionally looking but now that I've found them I can't stop looking.\n\nI thought they'd clear up in a couple of days but I checked again. The original ones are still there and there are a couple more (about 10-12 in total on my upper arms from what I can see). I've also noticed a couple of them on my elbows and 2 on my chest. I'm not sure if they've been there this whole time or they're newly formed.\n\nIs this something to worry about? I have health anxiety so this stuff really freaks me out (especially when I heard it's common in leukemia) and I'd really love if someone could calm me down a bit. It plays over and over in my mind constantly.\n\nIf you have any suggestions on what to do about them or if they are common please let me know!\n\nI have no other symptoms (fatigue, nose bleeds, bruising etc).

I had a carotid artery ultrasound, bubble test for PFO, brain MRI, blood tests for multiple clotting disorders, and 30 days on a Holter, and nothing was found except some PVCs that I've always had. I have not had any neurological or cardiac problems since. I was told that another pregnancy would be fine, however, my neurologist said that if I did become pregnant, she would want a loop monitor implanted, because the last stone to overturn would be \\*extended\\* monitoring for AFib.\n* I got pregnant 28 weeks ago and saw my neurologist at 20 weeks. As had been previously discussed, she ordered a loop monitor for me. This order had to go through a cardiologist first. I saw him, and he was very enthusiastic about the loop monitor idea, saying that while on one hand I'm low-risk for AFib, on the other hand, the fact that it's the last big thing to test for makes it make sense. He also thought monitoring my pregnancy-related PVCs\u2014which can get pretty bad in the third trimester and especially postpartum\u2014would be a good idea.\n* Imagine my surprise when I was lying at the hospital, naked, scrubbed, and ready to be wheeled into the OR for local anesthetic and loop monitor implantation, and the cardiologist hastily sticks his head in the door and says, \"When I scheduled this, I forgot you were pregnant. I don't want to use lidocaine on a pregnant woman.\" He's lying. We specifically discussed the benefit of the loop monitor in pregnancy. I have no idea why that happened. I'm still baffled by the whole thing.\n* My OB was shocked when I told him today, and said he really thinks I need to get a second opinion and try to get the loop monitor in, and he gives his complete blessing for lidocaine use.\n* Here's my question: both neurologist and cardiologist are part of the same hospital system. I like the system, but I'm wondering if there are any politics afoot re: giving a completely different second opinion that goes against a colleague's recommendation. In other words, if Cardiologist #1 has said, \"No loop monitor for this pregnant lady,\" are his colleagues' hands tied, to some degree, even just by professional courtesy or convention? Should I look at a different local health system? Time is of the essence here, which complicates things a little.  \n\n\nEd: accidentally posted without text; mistyped Metformin dose"

I've also been having pain, almost a soreness in my leg and arm, which is noticeable when I do any kind of activity.\n\nI went to my nurse prac today and told him about this, but he said he wasn't worried and it was my anxiety doing this. I've been on 10mg buspirone for anxiety for over a month and was bumped up to 15mg today (twice a day in both cases). My anxiety was better for a bit, but once this started happening I started falling apart. I'm not struggling to walk, though I do feel like my muscles in both cases are a bit weaker now. My right leg and arm are fine, a bit of twitching on the right leg but not nearly as bad.\n\nI told him I was scared it could be ALS but despite that he isn't sending me to a neuro to do any kind of testing. I know how incredibly rare it is for someone my age to have it, but my mind is so focused on it. Should I have fought harder for testing? Can I go see a neuro without a referral from my nurse prac? I want to believe it's anxiety, but I'm terrified after seeing what this disease does to people."

Diagnosed with sleep apnea. 5'10\" 295 lbs. I have a desk job and sit most of the day. Not active.\n\nSymptoms include tingling/numbness in upper left thigh/hip on the side. Each day my left ankle swells up, In the morning it is back to normal. I am currently having pain in the upper left shin/below knee cap, it's more like a soreness but certainly not from exercise. My leg feels fatigued (that's the best way I can describe it). If I stand for an extended period I also get pain in my upper left thigh where it meets my torso slightly towards the groin area. I have started favoring my left leg when walking to/from car in parking lot, etc.\n\nThe tingling has been ongoing for months and is tolerable although sometimes I will catch myself rubbing it not because it hurts but to just get the feeling back. The leg pain, ankle swelling, fatigue started in the last 4-6 weeks. My doc thinks it is related to my sleeping on my left side which is causing inflammation (bursitis) in my hip/thigh that is causing ankle to swell. Advised me to do stretches in the morning to stretch out the area.\n\nNo discoloration or sign of clotting in my leg. One leg/foot does not feel warmer or colder than the other. My SIL is an RN and says my feet have good pulses. I told her what my doc said and she said I could also try Ibuprofen to see if that helps with the fatigue/soreness so that I am not favoring/limping."

I had not eaten breakfast yet, which is not out of the ordinary for me. I started to feel dizzy and leaned up against a tree. I stood up and tried to make it back to my apartment but I couldn\u2019t and went to sit back down and ended up blacking out on my way down and hitting my head on the concrete. I was out for 30 seconds which is the longest I\u2019ve been out, then started convulsing for a few seconds. When I came too my boyfriend was on the phone with 911. Then I got really scared because I was still super faint and could not move my arms or legs. My boyfriend also said I was bewildered and looked very scared of him when I first came back.

My first thoughts go to anxiety or imminent sickness as possible causes. But is there anything else more concerning I should be aware of?

I have been experiencing ultra severe abdominal pain for over three months and no one can find an answer. I've seen countless doctors including a gastroentologist, been to the ER three times, had tests done (blood, urine, stool, colonoscopy) but no one can find anything. Honestly, doctors are sick of me already. It took me several weeks to connect the fact that it wasn't the way I was sitting that hurt me nor the time of day but it was when I smoked (vaped) marijuana. I also realized that during this time, I was smoking street weed when I've normally only smoked medical grade. Is it possible a chemical/pesticide used on it could have caused this? I can't find anything anywhere online where anyone has had anything remotely similar to me other than people who are vomiting but that's not the case. I haven't smoked in a month and even though I have minimal constant burning that lessens daily, I haven't had an attack where it burns so horribly bad, I'm convinced I'm dying from the inside. I honestly didn't think that's what caused it for me but I'm believing it more and more every day. Unless, of course, the marijuana is just exasperating what's already going on. The pain (during a flare up which was nightly for three months) would be my entire abdomen, from the bottom of my ribcage to my pelvis, front of body only (if you can classify abdominal pain that way, it's never in my back). It started as upper abdominal and what seemed like nightly would continue to increase in size, moving down my body. Now that I've stopped smoking completely, I haven't had an attack (flare up) but I still have mild burning which seems to slowly be getting better. I've only smoked for four years, nightly for anxiety but (I don't know if this is coincidence or not) edibles or oils do not process whatsoever in my body. They do nothing, never have.  Also, my tolerance level has always been incredibly high, for all four years, and I never feel the effects of marijuana for longer than 45 mins but the severe pain will last hours and the residual pain lasts days/weeks."

More frequent urge to urinate, not feeling like the bladder is totally empty, burning urination ranging from mild to extremely uncomfortable, dribbling, trouble starting a stream, etc. At least one of these issues comes up daily, but usually things are mild except in small bursts. About a month ago, however, I felt it was getting worse and decided I would get checked out. This is around the time the lower back pain started, and from there it hasn't really stopped. I figured it was, as I said, kidney or prostate related. I've now done a renal ultrasound, multiple urinalysis', and a cat scan and everything came back normal, yet I'm still having all these issues. I can deal with the urinary stuff, it isn't really obstructing my life too much, but I don't know how much longer I can deal with this back pain. Some days it isn't too bad, just a very minor ache. Other days I'm limping around and in severe pain. I do work a retail job and the back pain was the only thing that started after getting a promotion which has me working 10 and 12 hour shifts regularly, on my feet at all times except on breaks. I'm not sure if that has something to do with it. I was also a smoker for a few years, and vaped for about a year until a week ago when I decided to quit (haven't had nicotine at all since). I'm not sure if that adds anything. I just need some sort of an answer. Is it all in my head? I do have OCD and anxiety, and tend to stress a lot. That said I've been working hard on that with mindfulness and meditation along with medication (citalopram if it matters). It may be worth noting that the back pain did not start until after I read symptoms of kidney stones, but if it was in my head wouldn't it have gone away by now? And all the other symptoms started long ago as I said. I don't know what to do anymore; should I just get a massage or something? Kind of a joke but hell, if that'll work..\n    Also I'm just now realizing that I included some things in the requirements before reading them, but to reiterate I quit smoking and vaping, drink once a week or less, smoke marijuana on occasion (used to be daily, now maybe once a month or so). Citalopram 20mg, Naproxene 500mg (what they gave me for the pain, doesn't really work). Only other medical issue is the OCD."

        "reddit": "My father (56M, asian, 170cm, 60kg, smokes half a pack per day, used to drink but no longer does) has had chronic fatigue symptoms for more than 2 years. The main complaints are:\n\n* Generic flu-like fatigue throughout the day, but is much worse in the morning than in the evening.\n* \"Tightness\" in the brain, \"brain fog\" and difficulty in concentration. Lack of interest in most daily tasks and hobbies.\n* Sleep issues. At one point, he complained about not being able to take a nap after lunch. He also complained about not able to fall asleep easily after waking up at night.\n* Complaints and obsession on elevated heart rate. Would complain about a HR of 100+/min after minor exertion (like preparing for lunch) or a resting HR of 85/min, saying this is much higher than before he got sick.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo give a sense of seriousness, these symptoms made him unable to work, and at times homebound. The intensity of these symptoms and the psychological stress seems to vary on a few-days timescale. He could spend a day without any verbal complaint, and on the next day get worse to the point of expressing loss of hope, loss of trust of doctors and dissatisfaction with how family, friends and ex-coworkers have treated him.\n\nHe claims that the onset was acute - sudden onset of headache while going for a long walk. This headache lasted for two days, followed by the fatigue symptoms. The headache has not come back since.\n\nPrior to the onset of the fatigue symptoms, he was forced to retire (from the welfare program point of view in my country) since his former employer went bankrupt. There was a litigation against his employer that went nowhere, which to me it seems to have greatly upset him. He was also bed-bound for a month or two due to a somewhat serious back injury, but has since recovered. Worth noting is that he was given conflicting treatment plans from different doctors which we think reduced his trust for medical professionals in general.\n\nHe has done blood, urine and stool tests, as well as chest and head CT, spine X-ray, spine neck and head MRI, abdominal ultrasound, and so on. As far as I know, nothing pathological has been found. He has seen neurologists and psychiatrists, and a diagnosis of somatic symptom disorder, anxiety disorder and depression was made. Based on the history given above, we (his family) think this is a trustworthy diagnosis.\n\nHe is treated over the years with antidepressants, anxiolytics and antipsychotics, including Venlafaxine, divalproex sodium, Aripiprazole, Alprazolam, Olanzapine, Paroxetine, Mirtazapine, Oxazepam, Escitalopram, Clonazepan, Tandospirone, etc. Most of these drugs have a minimal effect on his symptoms. (Dosage changes over the years but I can try to track it down if needed.) One notable exception is Alprazolam, which he claims to alleviate his symptoms quickly, albeit temporarily. He also claims that Propranolol HCl helped with his heart rate symptoms.\n\nHe has also had a few counseling sessions and reported negative feelings about the cost and efficacy of counseling. He is currently rejecting further counseling sessions. And the psychiatrist he is current seeing thinks it's not necessary.\n\nThe chronic symptoms have greatly taxed his physical and mental health. He has had mostly homebound life for two years, with occasional walks around the block in the evenings as a form of exercise, and no one to talk to during the day (my mother has to work, and I'm studying on a different continent). He has frequently expressed doubt and distrust on his current and past psychiatrists and their professional decisions, including the treatment plans and even the diagnosis. Would talk about how going to doctors in a bigger city or even seeking foreign medical advice could have provided him better care and more personalized medicine tailored to his symptoms.\n\nWe are at a loss about how to alleviate his pain and address his physical and psychological symptoms. It seems to me the key is to rebuild his trust for medical professionals, after which maybe for example counseling and CBT will become more effective. But really I have no idea. But let me try to formulate a few questions:\n\n1. As his family, what can I do to get a patient with chronic psychological illness which does not respond much to drugs to have more faith in doctors.\n2. What are CBT-like talk points we can adopt to try to get him to focus less on his symptoms and more on his life functions like caring for himself?\n3. Are there other treatment options we can go after?\n4. Should we consider the possibility of a misdiagnosis? And if so, in which direction should we pursue?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR My father is diagnosed with somatic symptom disorder, treated mostly with antidepressants and anxiolytics for two years, but hasn't seen much improvement if any. What should we do?"

Halfway through my freshman year of college I out of nowhere starting getting really dizzy to the point that I would faint or come close to fainting. Occasionally my vision would also black out while I was still conscious. \n\nI\u2019ve been seen by two different primary care physicians, a neurologist, a cardiologist and an ENT. \n\nThe first doctor I saw about this issue was in the ER. They did several ct scans of my head (all normal) and a bunch of blood test which also all came back normal so they released me and said go to your primary doctor. And then they thought it might be a blood sugar issue or blood pressure issue. Come to find out my blood pressure and blood sugars were completely normal while I was at my most dizzy. \n\n\nMy first primary care doc did testing for lime which was negative. She did another blood panel, all normal. So she decided to send me to the neurologist. \n\nThe neurologist had me get a MRI of my brain which was completely normal. Had all the other neurological testing done and everything was normal other than I have a slight nystagmus in my left eye. So she decided to label the dizziness as a migraine variant even though the dizziness was mostly situational. When it first started I was just dizzy all the time but it got worse while driving or singing. \n\nShe suggested seeing a cardiologist just to make sure my heart was ok and they decided to put me on a month long event monitor so they could monitor and record when I was having symptoms to see if they were related to my heart. That was all completely normal other than me being out of shape. \n\nAfter the first year, my symptoms became manageable. I sat while singing and the driving became easier and I wasn\u2019t dizzy all the time. It came and went and this past year it started becoming more apparent again. I switched to a new primary care doctor and we\u2019ve been working on managing a lot of my other medical issues to see if that would calm the dizziness but it didn\u2019t. \n\nI then got referred to an ENT after being sick for this past year and they decided I needed my tonsils and adenoids out because of having strep multiple times. Now post surgery about 3.5 months I am now dizzy fairly often again and am not comfortable driving alone and can\u2019t sing and I still have post surgical pain. \n\nI got referred to a speech therapist to have a stroboscopy done to see if my vocal chords were functioning the way they needed to be, which they are thank god. I am still seeing a therapist for vocal fatigue but she has no clue what could be causing the dizziness. \n\nThe last thing I\u2019ve done was talked to my primary about my anxiety and he put me on a medication to take daily with another to take as needed and I\u2019ve noticed my anxiety go down but I\u2019m still dizzy. \n\nI\u2019m at a stand still right now and I\u2019m hopeless because I\u2019m unable to function in my daily life the way I\u2019d like to be able to.

First thing that was odd was that my blood pressure was 140/90 and pulse was 99. This was shocking since I\u2019ve actually always had a problem with LOW blood pressure (typically in the 90/60 range). Yes, I have anxiety, but I weirdly like going to the doctor, and I really didn\u2019t feel anxious. I say this to my doctor and she wanted to run an EKG, which was normal, and said my blood pressure lowered while I was laying down. The rest of the appointment was pretty standard, they took blood for bloodwork and I went home.\n\nFlash forward to Sunday (3 days ago), and I got my test results back. Everything looked normal/standard for me, except my cortisol and ACTH plasma levels were high (Cortisol was 23.10ug/dL, ACTH Plasma was 71pg/mL). \n\nOther things to note are that my body has changed drastically over the past year. A year ago, I was an XS and weighed 110lbs. I\u2019m a dancer and take lessons 3-4 times a week, and on the days I\u2019m off dance I try to get 10,000 steps in, eat 1200 calories/day most days. I know gaining weight is a symptom of getting older, but I\u2019m 23 and active, and no matter what I cannot shed this weight. My face that used to be super angular is now round, pudgy and acne ridden, and I have huge purple stretch marks all over my stomach and thighs.\n\nIt\u2019s been 3 days and my doctor still hasn\u2019t gotten back to me (I\u2019ve called everyday, they say she\u2019s busy), and I\u2019m confused as to what those results could mean. I really don\u2019t want to go down the rabbit hole of Dr. Google or webMD, as admittedly I do have some health anxiety, so I\u2019d really really appreciate some professional advice.\n\nIs this something I should be concerned about or am I just making it a bigger deal in my head than it really is?"

I live in the USA and have traveled internationally to about 15-20 countries in the past 24 months (including countries in Africa, South America, Central America, Mexico, Canada, India, China, Korea, etc.) I work a high stress job (Engineering management).  About 2.5 years ago I started noticing myself forgetting details that I would have normally remembered.  I had neuropsych testing scheduled (after seeing my PCP), but didn't follow through with it due to personal reasons that were non-medical in nature.\n\nI've been considerably more forgetful and have had a harder time of picking things up that are academic in nature compared to just a few years ago.  I feel as though the past few months have started to see a more marked decline in my cognition.  I have always been very forgetful of names, but I have a partner that I've been seeing for a little over a month and I can't remember her last name for the life of me despite her telling me a few times (and I recall it's not something difficult).   I'm also unable to recall specific periods of time -- for instance this Saturday I recall being on my motorcycle at a self-service car-wash, but I have no idea what came after that.  I have no recollection between that period and waking up Sunday morning.  I vaguely remember eating a salad in the mall food court, but honestly that may have been a different day entirely. \n\nThe most pronounced symptom of this started to manifest in the past 2-3 months, I have routinely started forgetting to zip up my pants after using the bathroom.   I will button my pants and fasten my belt... but completely forget to do my zipper.  I've forgotten to do this about ~6 times in my life until the past 3 months, and in the past 3 months it's been about a 70% chance to forget doing it.  I often remember 3-5 minutes after going to the bathroom to \"check\" because I recall being ABSOLUTELY MORTIFIED by doing this in the past....\n\nI am concerned -- and there is a growing body of evidence that suggests that there's something wrong -- is it just stress and age, or is this something I should be actively alarmed and seeking medical attention for?"

I have lost 25lbs since February. This is about a Brain Lesion. \n\nPast medical history: I was diagnosed with Epilepsy, specifically in my temporal lobe, at age 6. Within the same year, I was diagnosed with JRA. They have no idea what caused either one of these. I have complex partial seizures and my RA has been generally controlled for many years. \n\nCurrent meds: I am taking Xeljanz (RA) 11mg 1x day, Zonisamide 600 mg 1x day (Epilepsy), Celexa 20 mg 1x day (depression), Trazadone 100 mg per day as needed (insomnia), and Sumatriptan (migraines). My doctor recently changed my epilepsy meds to 500mg Zonisamide and 150 2x day to Vimpat, but I am still waiting on these meds so this hasn't been filled yet.\n\nCurrent issue: This year I had a follow-up MRI because I began having seizures for the first time in 5 years in January 2019.

No one noticed this other than the radiology tech who clearly notated it on the MRI scan. Both are 3T images. \n\nWhat we've done so far: \n-Neurologist #1 believed this was due to a stroke, so we got an MRI of my head + neck, and an echo. He also didn't have the 2014 MRI yet at this time. All of those test came back as my blood is pumping normally and then he saw growth from my 2014 MRI. So, he then decided this was a glioma.\n-Fast forward to August 26th, I saw a neuro-oncologist. He was a jerk. He said he only sees patients when they have had a biopsy and confirmed cancer, and he \"didn't know why I was there.\" He said it could be Lyme disease (then said I would know if it was Lyme), he then said it could be TB and recommended I get a spinal tap (then said I would know if I had TB for 5 years), then said it could be a stroke (but said I would know if I had a stroke). I left SO disappointed. \n\nNext steps I have right now:\n-I have an appt with my Neurologist #2 on September 4th\n-I have an appt with my Rheumatologist on September 5th\n-I am trying to set up an appt with a neurosurgeon to potentially \"rule out\" tumor. Because the doctor I saw the other day wouldn't even do that.\n\nI am hoping someone here is willing to look at my scans to see if you have seen this before or offer some advice.

It all happened so stupidly fast that I don't even know how big it was, but I know the impact was somewhat significant, anyway I go to the emergency room and ask about vaccines and he first said there's a shortage of immunoglobin stuff but will atleast get you vaccinated. \n\nSo I guess the health officer or whatever he calls it is where the vaccine comes from and he calls them at and they say we're not even vaccinating for this type of contact anymore and they send me on my way. I go home and google how it's possible you can't even see a bite or scratch and how although the risk is low the consequences are so high they almost always vaccinate anyway, and I start getting pretty worried. It's 4am now so I can't do much but call my family doctor in the morning. They go on to say they want to see me but I cannot get in until 11am tomorrow. I don't know what he's going to say or recommend but my biggest worry is the time between contact and then, it will have be a minimum of 36 hours by the time I'm able to see him.\n\nI also don't know anything about bat's but I do know it's strange for them to fly into a human, I was standing by a pretty bright white light so I wonder if it was disorintated but still my anxiety has me in grips about this and I was hoping to get some advice on how to proceed as I've basically done everything I can do right now anyway.\n\nThank you in advance for taking the time to read this."

He said ok and called it in. I took 75 mg for a week or so then 100 mg for the past week or so.\n\nI've also, due to increased anxiety, been taking anywhere between .5 mg to 2 mg ativan every day for the past 3 weeks.

        "reddit": "I've been trying to figure out my fatigue, exhaustion, swallowing / breathing issues, etc for more than a year now. I remember the doctors were concerned about my red blood cell depiction, but when I told them I had thal minor they said \"oh that explains it\". However, I'm wondering whether this trait couldn't be masking features of b12 deficiency (or some similar anemia). For instance, I'm reading a case report where\n\n&gt;Hemoglobin electrophoresis showed thalassemia trait, and that probably masked the megaloblastic features of vitamin B12 deficiency [1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6128271/) \n\nAnd there are similar cases [2](https://www.unboundmedicine.com/medline/citation/17899503/%5BAutoimmune_pernicious_anemia_masked_by_beta_thalassemia_minor%5D_) \n\nThe reason I'm concerned is because, firstly, I'm absolutely exhausted, and the doctors I've been to haven't been able to find anything. Second, I have similar symptoms as found in anemia --\n\n* White gums\n\n* Difficulty concentrating\n\n* fatigue\n\n* memory issues\n\n* clumsy, wobbly gait; somewhat shaky; can't sit up straight on worse days\n\n* decreased appetite \n\nI also have shortness of breath, and what's interesting here is that on my bad days this results in a lot of sighing (more like long drawn out exhale like I'm dying lol), and I'm reading reports of people calling this \"the sighs\" in anemia. Also, I do have autoimmune issues in family.\n\nIf my thal trait is hiding anemia, what would it look like? What tests should I do to discern this? My symptoms are somewhat debilitating, so if it's not a health issue I'm probably going insane. Because the GPs I went to weren't able to find anything, I figured it was all due to anxiety... but what's turning me off that idea is the symptoms are unrelated to whether or not I'm anxious, and even prevent me from doing things that I enjoy doing when I'm ordinarily anxious (gaming, fapping). For instance, yesterday I helped my father with yardwork and really exerted myself hard. I went to bed feeling *great*, no anxiety, had a great dinner, totally refreshed, etc etc. But I was hit with insomnia, and then woke up this morning feeling absolutely miserable, not merely muscle soreness but horribly fatigued and unable to think, with \"the sighs\" and all, lying down most of day until 2pm... I can't help but feel like there's a health issue here and not simply anxiety.\n\nIt would really mean the world to me if I could figure this out, my life is pretty much on hold at the moment.\n\n--------------\n\nAge 24\n\nSex M\n\nHeight 6\n\nWeight 155\n\nRace White\nDuration of complaint 1-2 years\n\nLocation (Geographic and on body) East Coast USA\n\nAny existing relevant medical issues (if any) All mentioned\n\nCurrent medications (if any) No\n\nInclude a photo if relevant (skin condition for example) N/A"

I (38F) started having chronic pelvic pain at age 19. After a couple years of investigation the doctors threw up their hands, said they couldn\u2019t figure it out and decided to just medicate me. If there was a new symptom they either gave another script or if there was no script for that symptom they would tell me to ignore it. By age 31 I was on over a dozen prescriptions, including a 290mg twice per day dose of slow acting morphine plus up to 100mg of fast acting morphine per day, and had slowly lost any semblance of a normal life. I decided that this \u2018treatment\u2019 was going to kill me and started a 2 1/2 year journey to get off the morphine. My pain was almost non existent when I was done. I slowly improved and continued to taper off the other medications for the next couple years. \nIn 2016 I ended up with kidney stones for about 4 months and finished that up with a kidney infection. Early 2017 I was so weak and what I was doing wasn\u2019t helping me improve anymore. I started stretching, changed to a high fat/high nutrition paleo diet, removed as many stressors as possible and had the best 3 months physically and mentally of the last decade at least. Since then it\u2019s been a constant roller coaster of strange symptoms and because of my \u2018undiagnosed pelvic pain\u2019 and willingness to admit that I am working on my mental health I am constantly ignored when I look for help. My history is ridiculously long and honestly doesn\u2019t explain much. I\u2019m concerned that something important is being missed."

Probably a few years at this point, it is very on and off but has been acting up recently. (25/m) started in college maybe 2015?\n  \nI went and saw an urgent care doctor because I thought I had a new lump, but it was just my rib which is slightly larger than my right side.  Due to losing some weight normally over the past 6 months from sitting in front of my compter all day it made sense why I was seeing more bone.  I am 5'9 and 145lbs, quite skinny.  I normally sit between 145-155 when my weight fluctuates.\n  \nThe pressure/tightness/discomfort is on and off, I usually wake up feeling better but it slowly creeps in during the day.  I believe the cause could be anxiety, I have had an extremely stressful life for the past 10 months and have been unemployed for 6 of them by choice.    \n  \nI noticed my symptoms seemed to get worse with marijuana, which leads me to believe this is an anxiety/stress-driven symptom.  I have been a daily user since around the symptoms started... which developed into much heavier use once unemployed, I'm talking all day every day for the past 6 months.    I am quitting weed for the time being to give my body a reset which I hope helps, but I just wanted to ask here for more advice if there is any.  \n\n**A few more notes**  \n* I do have higher blood pressure, last I saw it was 125/80 at resting?  \n*  It seems to feel better with massage, but it does not get rid of the feeling.    \n* It is not increased in times of exercise, it usually dissapears when I am doing something active.   \n  \nJust in case you are curious the doctor recommended getting a job, having a significant life partner (which I have) and take Tylenol to ease it if it flares up.  I dislikeTylenol so I avoid it as I do not like the idea of taking it so often.    \n  \nThanks for reading and I look forward to hearing back."

(I am the first in my family to actually get genetically tested, but part of the reason it took so long for me to get help is because so SO many of that side of my family have similar issues that it's just considered normal and as my Nana said 'it just runs in our blood')\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to look up the actual name for this expecting to quickly find it because it is just such a common thing in my family, but I couldn't find any information about it other than in an EDS forum with a bunch of other EDSers saying that they and their family also have this though they weren't sure it was directly related to EDS.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAny idea what the name of this is or whether it could be related to Ehlers Danlos?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am a 5'6, \\~190lb, 24 years old female. I do not smoke or drink alcohol. I have recently been diagnosed with Ehlers Danlos Syndrome and have many of the comorbidities that come with that including dysautonomia, potentially POTS (I am still awaiting my cardiologist appointment to confirm),  GI issues (gastroparesis, GERD,  exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, SIBO, a hiatal hernia, and IBS), hypermobility throughout my body including regular dislocations/chronic pain. I wear ankle, knee, and wrist braces to help with these issues.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: My family has a gene that causes our eye color to change from dark brown to hazel, green, blue then grey over time? What is it and could it be related to Ehlers Danlos?"

I have suffered from generalized anxiety my whole life and take Lexapro for it. When I was a young child, I was misdiagnosed with OCD (or maybe appropriately diagnosed), but for 15+ years every doctor and therapist has treated me for generalized anxiety, no panic, no depression, no OCD.\n\nFor some reason, when I changed to a new doctor (this PCP), he added an OCD diagnostic code to my chart, in addition to generalized anxiety code. I do not recall ever discussing OCD with him (maybe the childhood diagnosis or history?). I do not have any rituals or compulsions (counting, checking, hoarding, etc), or obsessive intrusive thoughts (hurting myself; disgusting or violent thoughts; etc) (other than occasional worrying about life in general, which is my generalized anxiety). I score low on the OCD inventories. i surely do not meet the DSM for OCD.\n\nQuestion is, why would this be listed on my chart? As a PCP, we've barely talked about mental health at all -- he gave me the Lexapro prescription becasue I told him I have anxiety. Hell, he's probably never truly diagnosed me with anxiety despite what I've told him after the 5 minute initial visit.\n\nIs it normal for weird random codes to show up on a chart?"

I have been diagnosed with endometriosis and in recent years have had sciatica, a torn rotator cuff, and chondromalacia in one of my knees. I have anxiety and depression. My mother has Hashimoto's and fibromyalgia and my younger sister was recently diagnosed with Hashimoto's as well.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMeds are Trazodone 100mg 1x daily, Wellbutrin 300mg 1x daily, Zoloft 50mg 1x daily, Atenolol 25mg 1x daily, and Xanax .25mg as needed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOver the past two months, I've developed a lot of symptoms and have been unable to live like normal. Here is a list of my symptoms:\n\n* Extreme fatigue (I can never feel rested no matter how much sleep I get)\n* General muscle weakness (I can't lift things that used to be no problem)\n* Shortness of breath (this can be when I'm sitting and talking or laying down even, not just walking around, though it is really bad when I'm up and about, almost resulting in passing out), it feels like I can never get a good breath and sometimes it feels like my throat is closing up\n* Constipation every day, but sometimes diarrhea\n* I get really shaky when I'm doing anything but laying down, mostly just my hands but sometimes my whole body is basically vibrating\n* I run a low-grade fever (usually 99.0 to 100.0) almost every day\n* I bruise very easily\n* My arms and legs will go numb if I'm up and doing things for a period of time, sometimes only just 5 minutes\n* I have headaches every day\n* If I've done anything physical joints and muscles will hurt for a day after in the area that I was using (elbow and shoulder hurt when using arm)\n* I'm always cold\n* My hair is thinning out a lot\n* Brain fog\n* Low blood pressure (lowest was 78/50 when my norm is about 100/70)\n* Back pain, seemingly where my kidneys are\n* Lightheadedness and dizziness\n* Dry mouth\n* Sometimes it feels like my heart is beating out of my chest\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've seen my PCP a few times for this.

No anemia or infection in blood work. Normal kidney and liver function. Thyroid had no inflammation or nodules on ultrasound.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI just need help trying to figure this out or at least be pointed in the right direction.

I appreciate you all in advance. \n\nI\u2019m about to start my first year of medical school in a couple of weeks. Also, I finally opened up to my doctor about the anxiety, depression and hypochondria I\u2019ve been experiencing for the past couple of years. I, almost daily, wake up with a strong sense of impending doom and that something will go wrong, especially with my body even though I\u2019m 25. The other time, I\u2019m just emotionally neutral towards my life and aspirations, even though to a normal person, my life seems good. We agreed together that I should start Zoloft 50 mg daily. I am open to the pharmacological route as I cannot afford therapy plus I am convinced that something is genuinely off with my brain chemistry. However, I am yet to take my first pill. I am worried that my \u201cbrain sharpness\u201d will go down which might affect my performance. I\u2019m scared I will become dull on Zoloft. I know nobody here can tell me exactly what my response will be, but am I exaggerating the side effects in my mind? (this is exactly the reason I was rx\u2019d it lol). On the other hand, I also have pretty bad social anxiety - my heart starts to beat fast and I get embarrassed easily when I\u2019m in a larger group of people, and I know Zoloft helps with that too. I can go on and on about the reasons why I think it will help me but yet that one bad potential side effect (yes I\u2019m aware there are others) is what bugs me. How bad is the brain fog? Is it bad enough to dull my mind to the point of not being able to concentrate? If so, is it something a cup of coffee can fix?

My diet is average I guess; I don't often eat unhealthy stuff. My only exercise consists of 10-15min walks on the way home from work.\n\nTwo evenings ago, I was sitting on my chair at work with nothing to do. I can't remember what I was thinking about but I know for sure it was harmless and had nothing to do with my future or life, and yet I was sent into this sudden state of extreme nervousness.

It's kinda chilly in my workplace, but I didn't feel cold before then.\n\nA few minutes later my chest started feeling tight. This intensified over my 40-min commute home. It felt as though my chest was being harshly squeezed, with the pain being the most intense at the middle. It wasn't exactly unbearably painful, but it was enough to make me freak out internally even more, especially since the pain wouldn't go away. I felt fatigue and a need to lie down. I had this feeling like I was going to die.\n\nI had to go to a shop before going home, and even though it was an air conditioned place, I started heating up, as in the kind of heat you feel when you have a fever. I quickly did my 10-15min walk home, trying to calm myself down before I freaked myself out to death. At home I took a couple of antacid tablets as per my family's suggestion. I'm not sure I was having a heartburn since I wasn't experiencing an acidic or burning sensation, but I was willing to try anything to get rid of the pain. Nothing really changed afterwards apart my nervousness and dread going away. My chest pain only dissipated 4 hours after it first appeared, after I lay down in bed and watched some videos.\n\nThe next morning, my chest started feeling tight again, and then again the next, next morning (right now). Though not to the same intensity as the incident 2 nights ago, my chest has been feeling tight some days, especially in the morning, for the past 2 or so years. But that incident was accompanied by sudden dread, chills and then heating up. So what happened then? And why does my chest keep feeling tight?\n\nA friend reckons I had a panic attack, and I guess the symptoms line up more or less, but I don't know why I would have one. I will admit that I have minor mental health issues (I don't believe anxiety is one of them, but then again I've yet to see a mental health professional), but I haven't really been feeling down lately, just neutral.\n\nI would really appreciate some enlightenment lol"

I tried using a medicated shampoo and its helping but should I stop using it before seeing a doctor so not to alter test result to confirm what this is?\n\nDetailed Information:\nI've had what I had assumed was severe dandruff for years. I never though much of it. It had always been rather itchy, my scalp was always burning hot, visually red and irritated, sore, and even right after a shower, would still drop flakes of skin. Specific areas would be really bad, usually being these protruding bumps with a scaly feeling. I usually would scratch and make them bleed during to irritation but even when given weeks to heal. They never did. They always remained there and always in the same spots. I never really assumed this was weird or abnormal since I've had an itchy scalp for so long. I only remember it got really bad a few years back but I've almost always had issues with my scalp. But during a visit to a hair dresser I decided to get all my hair cut and shave the sides short. This was the first time ever having short hair and that's when a few hair dresser all asked if I have a skin condition. I told them about the \"dandruff\" and they said it looked far worse then that. That when one hair dresser mentioned it looked like scalp psoriasis. She said she had it and thats why she could recognize it, then reccomend I visit my doctor as it looks so badly irritated. Sure enough when I looked it the mirror my while scalp was bright red. I had never really noticed I suppose since I'd always had long hair. Additionally I had tried using differnt shampoos but it never particularly made a differnce that I noticed.\n\nI do plan on seeing my doctor once I can but he only recently returned from vacation so hes pretty busy. So doctors of reddit. What's your opinion based on my symptoms. I realize a picture would help alot buuuut that brings me to my second question.\n\nI decided to try looking into it and thought I might try a over the counter, medicated shampoo, to see if it actually would help. Sure enough it has. It's been 2 weeks since starting to use it and the difference is oddly incredible. My scalp is no longer on fire basically. It's not red. The itchy, though still there, has significantly reduced and for the first time in years the bumps have started going away. But I'm not sure if i should stop using the medicated shampoo so my doctor can get a better look at my scalp when its actually flared. I dont know how scalp psoriasis is diagnosed, or any skin condition for that matter. If its primarily visible I worry the shampoo might alter any results. If I should stop how much time should I give it to wear off before seeing my doctor. Thanks!"

It started when we were on vacation and hasn\u2019t stopped since we came back 6 days ago. Ibuprofen, tylenol, midol, aleve, advil, meds they gave me in er(other than dilaudid, which I do not want to have to use again), and some \u2018migraine relief\u2019 pill I don\u2019t remember the actual contents of haven\u2019t helped at all. The only things that reliably make it worse are sudden, sharp, loud noises and super bright lights. Say a room is evenly lit, it doesn\u2019t bother me, but if there\u2019s one brighter light in the room it feels like my eyes are straining. \n\nI\u2019ve also been getting what I can only describe as a staticky feeling, like when your arm is kind of asleep, throughout my chest and head from time to time. Today it only started happening after I ate my first meal, not sure about the other few days because I wasn\u2019t really tracking it. It makes me feel like I\u2019m going to pass out but I haven\u2019t lost consciousness or fallen. I\u2019ve experienced mild to severe nausea when the headache increases in severity. \n\nMy ears constantly feel like they\u2019re about to pop, and one night at the ER(felt like I was dying), they said my eardrums were bulging, my left one more than the right, and when I came back yesterday as recommended if it got worse, she said my ears looked perfect. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s relevant since they looked fine\n\nI\u2019ve been experiencing double vision from time to time but it feels more like my eyes aren\u2019t focusing right, and I\u2019ve been having times where the chest/head static happens and my eyes start to go black like when you stand up too quickly sometimes. It happened while I was driving once and I haven\u2019t driven since. Sometimes it feels like there\u2019s a static filter on the lowest setting on everything, especially when it\u2019s lighter in the room. It also feels like I\u2019m straining when I look directly up. \n\nI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s relevant but a couple of months ago I started getting hand pains and my doctor had me go to physical therapy and said it was muscle weakness. Tests for autoimmune diseases and arthritis came back negative. Physical therapy didn\u2019t improve or worsen my hands. \n\nMore on the ER visits, the first visit they treated it like it was a normal migraine. They gave me thorazine, toradol, and benadryl in shots first. They didn\u2019t do anything. Then they gave me haldol and ativan(I\u2019m pretty sure it was ativan) and zofran, and those only made me super sluggish and tired. Before that visit I was sleeping 5-6 hours, after that I\u2019ve been sleeping 10 ish hours and having to take naps throughout the day. \n\nSecond visit I passed a neurological exam, so they tried the first 3 meds again, but gave me the thorazine as a pill. When that didn\u2019t work, they gave me a muscle relaxer I can\u2019t recall the name of. After I was still in pain, they gave me Dilaudid. They recommended I see my PCP and get a referral for an MRI, but if nothing showed up on the MRI, consider dietary changes. I have been eating 12-1500 calories a day recently and my IBS hasn\u2019t really been acting up, but I suppose if the MRI doesn\u2019t show anything I\u2019ll try FODMAP?\n\nAnyways, I\u2019m hopefully getting a referral on Sunday, then an MRI sometime during the week. Hopefully. I\u2019m very anxious about medical stuff due to bad experience with doctors, and I was wondering if anyone had any ideas on what this could be? I\u2019ve been so stressed from being in pain and not being able to fix it that I got hives today. Any input is really appreciated, thank you. Thank you for reading this as well\n\nETA: I\u2019ve had my tonsils and adenoids removed, I also had scarlet fever as a child. I had strep throat a lot as well due to my tonsils. I used to get bronchitis almost yearly until my grandma passed away. I also had costochrondritis in January and I\u2019ve had ovarian cysts large enough to cause pain but not large enough to warrant concern.

Regarding that: I was diagnosed in 2013 by a psychiatrist. I trialled quite a few meds and settled on fluoxetine 60mg/day. I was on this for years, sometimes with amytriplaline(sp?). I came off these in 2017 while pregnant and gave birth in December 2017. Perfect birth, all great. I tried to go back on fluoxetine but had really bad GI symptoms. I then moved GPs due to a house move. They gave me Citalopram which made me edgy. They also gave me a diagnosis of GAD and put my increasing fatigue down to having a toddler. They would not do any blood tests to rule out anaemia or thyroid problems or anything physical. They wouldn\u2019t do anything until I saw the psychiatrist again which I did in July and she took me off Citalopram and put me on Paroxetine due to the anxiety. So she agrees that it\u2019s the anxiety and not my BPD. She ordered bloods including ferritin and thyroid but I have no idea where those results are but I\u2019m assuming they\u2019d have contacted me if anything was wrong.\n\nSo, to my current problem. I am exhausted. All the time. My body hurts. All the time. I have muscle cramps (in the area of an old injury behind my knee) and also have random muscle tightness(?) in random places. I\u2019m dropping weight like crazy even though I\u2019m eating as much as I can. Before pregnancy I was 12 stone, after pregnancy I was around the same, she\u2019s now 19 months and I\u2019m about 9.5stone. \n\nMy toddler really isn\u2019t that much hard work. But, as mentioned above, my GP has put my fatigue down to having a toddler. For reference, I\u2019m a stay at home mum and my partner works 12 hour shifts 7/14 but his commute is 2 hours each way.\n\nSo what\u2019s next? Do I accept the \u201cdiagnosis\u201d of GAD and toddler tiredness or would you try and figure this out? I know the anxiety causes tiredness, I know the paroxetine causes tiredness. But not constant fatigue (which I\u2019ve had since before I was on paroxetine). \n\nI\u2019ve really tried to get to the bottom of this but it\u2019s all being blamed on my mental health (which is fair enough... up to a point).\n\nSorry, I\u2019ve rambled. A quick timeline:\n\n- 2013: diagnosed with BPD. Already on fluoxetine.\n- 2014-March 2017: on fluoxetine, occasionally being bumped with amytriptaline\n- March 2017: got pregnant, weaned meds by 12ish weeks\n- August 2017: signed off work (very high pressure environment, very mentally intensive but I was bloody good at it!) due to low blood pressure and fatigue which made me collapse several times at work\n- December 2017: had baby\n- Jan/Feb 2018: given iron tablets as have a history of anaemia and showed low on blood test. Blood test a month later shows normal so stop tablets\n- July 2018: blood test shows thyroid  fine \n- March 2018-May 2019: symptoms getting progressively worse\n- May 2019-now: symptoms declining rapidly\n\nFamily history:\nFather (52): history of TIAs, bipolar, first heart attack at 31\nMother (61): slightly high blood pressure, heart attack 10 years ago (thought to be because she was in an abusive relationship)\nGrandmother (84): had thyroid op as a baby but we don\u2019t know why and has been on thyroxine since she can remember, has an empty sack instead of a pituitary gland - she had a scan a few years ago looking for the cause of her pressure (?) headaches (her head hurt when she laid on her back) and they couldn\u2019t find it but they never investigated, also has general age-related things such as high blood pressure, angina etc\nMisc: cousin has an overactive thyroid, closest relative with cancer is my Dad\u2019s aunt, most people in my family die from dementia or Alzheimer\u2019s \n\nSymptoms:\n- fatigue \n- Body aches (history of knee problems, they tested for RA on a whim years ago but they lost the sample and didn\u2019t follow up). This is like my knee pain but in all my joints. By years ago, I\u2019m talking 15 years at least\n- Muscle weirdness like when I\u2019m anaemic but more than that. Like my veins are cramping\n- Old injuries in my leg and hip playing up\n- Feet have patches that are either numb or on fire (been told tendinitis, I don\u2019t agree). Started in one foot but now in both (original is much worse). Volterol did nothing so I gave up trying to sort it.\n- Can\u2019t stand still for long as I feel faint and nauseous (happens after 15-30 seconds)\n- Can\u2019t walk long otherwise I feel faint (100/200 yards and I want a sit down)\n- Muscle weakness but I don\u2019t know if this is deconditioning or a symptom\n- Randomly feeling faint in the day - my ears go funny, I see stars, I sit down quickly. I thought this was blood sugar related but my step father tested my blood and it was 4.9 (I don\u2019t know how close to food it was)\n- Seem to be running hotter and I can\u2019t sit outside for long if there\u2019s even a bit of sun\n- My teeth are literally falling apart despite brushing twice per day and flossing once per day (but this could be genetic as my grandmother and mother had/have really bad teeth)\n- Get bloated easily and haven\u2019t found the trigger\n- Walking into things - feels like I\u2019m drunk (even though I\u2019m teetotal and have been about 6 years)\n- Fingers randomly going tingly/pins and needles/numb\n- Bruises that look bad but I don\u2019t remember doing\n- Weird white bumps on my hands (that are possibly linked to anxiety?)\n\nI have a small sum of money to get some blood tests privately, which would you have done, if any? And has anyone got any experience of getting an NHS GP to read private blood test results? How would you present any of this to a GP who doesn\u2019t believe you and/or seems biased because of your health history?\n\nSorry if formatting is off!"

This pain has been building over 1.5 years and feels \u2018crunchy\u2019 to the touch. It feels crunchy 100% of the time, but when in pain the crunchiness is increased. This feels different than \u2018knots\u2019 I\u2019ve had before in my shoulder area. Massaging of the area (by my partner) feels good but doesn\u2019t resolve anything for more than an hour. \n\nVisits (sorry this is long and detailed) \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n My pain specialist is a piece of work and during the first visit gave me gabapentin (300) 3x per day without even examining me. I even asked for her to please touch the area. I later found out her reviews are horrible and I\u2019ve been trying to switch specialists but I\u2019m seeing that\u2019s almost impossible. \n\nThe second visit, she had me get X-rays. I went because the 300mg (900 per day) wasn\u2019t helping me after a couple of weeks and the pain was so pestering that I couldn\u2019t sleep for 3 nights in a single week. She still wouldn\u2019t physically examine me after being asked to. This pain has never been painful in the sense that my endometriosis pain is, but it\u2019s irritating enough to keep me awake. The xrays showed the hypertrophy and DDD. \n\nThird visit, because again I\u2019m not sleeping, she offers to bump my medication from 300mg (900 per day) to 600mg (1800 per day), the max dose. I told her I would rather try 400mg and also try PT and OT. She doesn\u2019t physically examine me again, after me even emphasizing that it won\u2019t hurt if she touches the crunchy area, and says I have fibromyalgia and leaves the room. I do have fibromyalgia, but that\u2019s not the issue I\u2019m having. \n\nI\u2019ve been going to PT and OT for 6 weeks now and I\u2019m halfway through the program. I feel like nothing has happened and they don\u2019t have me doing anything stressful or harmful. Just light stretches and heat. I use to run half marathons from ages 15-19 and these stretches aren\u2019t even as intense as the ones I did for trainings. I also haven\u2019t been able to sleep again. Next pain specialist appointment I can make is for October at the earliest and I\u2019m on the list, but I doubt she\u2019ll even evaluate me properly at this point. \n\nEnd of visits \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nThe only thing I have found to bring me relief was my relatives BEMER machine (which helps blood movement). I don\u2019t think BEMER machines are that well known yet as they\u2019re very expensive. I was only able to use the machine twice, but had relief so great that I forgot to take my medication. I probably won\u2019t see that relative for another year or so. Maybe it was just coincidental that I felt so good. \n\nI think that I should try to get assigned to a rheumatologist, and while waiting on the list to see one I should maybe try and get an angiogram or mri script from my pain specialist through a medical online portal my provider has. I have had cysts removed from the head and neck before (all small, but done under general anesthesia) so maybe cysts are a possibility. I\u2019m not sure. \n\nI do not think that this pain has much to do with the X-ray results of hypertrophy and DDD. This is a release of pain and audible cracking in the muscle area when massaged. The sound and movement is NOT coming the actual bone. \n\nThank you in advance for any of your thoughts. I am an educator and am up from 6AM-10PM so anything to help end this would be great. I could use the sleep!"

As an adult, I rarely get ear infections or upper respiratory infections (maybe once every few years), but I am always stuffed up and struggle with breathing.  I am a runner and try to stay fairly active, which does not make breathing any easier or more difficult- so my breathing issues do not seem to be related to asthma.   I have had my allergies tested, and was allergic to very few things.   I have never really taken any medication for my congestion.  If it is really bad, I will take an Allegra, which makes a slight difference.  I have talked to my PCP and they just tried to brush it off as seasonal, but it is really year round.   I am so used to feeling this way, that I forget that it is not normal.  Yesterday a childhood friend commented on how I have always been constantly stuffed up and its not normal, which is the impetus for this post.  Does anyone have any idea of what this might be or be related to?  Is something I just need to be resigned to or is there some relief for those with chronic congestion issues?  Any suggestions for things to try to alleviate the symptoms?  Thank you!"

Today I had some type of rash but there were no red Mark's and went away when I put e45 on the area. Last week I was having sore arm and leg muscles but they have gone now and around 2 days ago my wrists and ankle joints have been painful I thought I had the flu the week I had sore muscles because I had a runny and congested nose a few days prior but the aches have gone now and I just have sore joints. I think it could be from working with my father 3 weeks ago because it was pretty intense work and really tired me out but I don't know if I could feel pain from work I did three weeks ago. It doesn't stop me from doing anything though and these might just be growing pains because I'm only 15 and pretty short for a Male my age.

I had more trouble with being able to see straight than with the pain,  to give a better idea. Here and there I have had very mild earache and dry/sore throat. My vertigo from my Meniere's has been more bothersome than normal and I took my last Aimovig shot on Tuesday, which I accidentally took two days late.\n\nLast night the migraine got a little worse but I dealt with it just fine with a cold forehead patch. It was practically gone by the time I went to bed.\n\nI woke up at about 2:00a.m. with what I would describe is the worst headache I have ever had in my entire life. It was so painful that I started to cry and panic. I genuinely considered going to the emergency room.\n\nMy head throbbed so hard, like blood rushing through it (as if I could hear and feel my heartbeat, basically) and the pain would become very significantly worse if I walked around or laid my head down no matter how I did it. If I as much as touched my head with my fingertips, the pain got far worse. I felt like someone had put a helmet on my head and neck that was far too tight for my head and like they kept tightening it more and more. My sinuses also felt like they were on fire.\n\nIn short, my head hurt so bad that I can't even put it into good words to explain it. It put the pain of all of my past kidney stones to shame.\n\nI took an Advil 200mg to calm it down. It took two hours for it to have enough of an affect that I could lay my head down and try to sleep through a bad migraine. I also developed really awful nausea. I was about to finally head to the ER when all of the pain came to a stop and I fell asleep.\n\nThis morning I felt miserable. I still do. I woke up with a 99 lowgrade fever (now gone), sinuses still hurting (but no leaking, runniness, backdrip, etc.), a headache that still behaves the way the one last night did only more of a pain level three, and nausea. I haven't even eaten yet today. I am scared that the Advil is controlling the pain and fever and that once it wears off, I'll be back to square one or worse.\n\nI have no issues heading to urgent care or the ER should it really get bad again, but also, I am a migraineur and I am worried (but also hopeful) that it's just a migraine gone berserk and I will cause them a waste of time. THAT SAID, I recently hit my head quite badly on the garage door but I have been healing up fine, in fact I feel like I am healed up all the way. To add another thing, I had cluster headaches when I was in third grade and I remember the pain being about the same as my attack last night. I also had a small fever and my sinuses ache despite feeling dry as a bone. In short, I don't know what to do.\n\nTreat at home for now? UC/ER if pain gets as bad as last night? Worth mentioning to my neurologist?"

Previously, I was in an extreme low point of my life and was considering suicide. Luckily, I was able to find the help I needed and was put on Zoloft originally. \n\nMonths go by and my psychiatrist changes up my dosing and medications but stayed within the SSRI class.

Basically, he said that he would refuse to prescribe me Vyvanse or Adderall because marijuana can have adverse effects on my brain in combination with those drugs. He then went on to imply that I can even develop schizophrenic-like symptoms by using cannabis for a long period of time. \n\nIs this accurate? If so, should I chose my medications or the cannabis?

I haven\u2019t lost any weight, I\u2019ve been 135 lbs for about a year now.\n\nI drink at least 80 oz of water a day, usually more like 100 oz but I always aim for 80.\n\nComplaint: So I\u2019ve always experienced the typical \u201coops I stood up too fast\u201d headrush from standing up after sitting for too long, but lately (over the past 2 weeks) it\u2019s gotten really bad. I\u2019ll be sitting for like 10 minutes, and then when I stand up I get extra light headed, to the point where I\u2019m swaying and trying to not pass out. I get a pretty intense pain in my head during these episodes where I can feel my blood pumping. My arms get tingly and I feel very floaty. Last night I got out of my car after driving for 10 minutes and I just about fell to the ground from how dizzy and light headed I was. \n\nI also experience that temporary (maybe 1 minute) pain and blood pumping in my head when I lay down, to go to bed for example. I don\u2019t get the light headedness when I lay down though. \n\nI eat normally, like I have for a long time. The snacking was a recent phenomenon after a breakup a couple months back. Emotional eating really sucks. But I\u2019m back to my normal eating routine.\n\nI\u2019m thinking that on Monday I\u2019ll give my primary care physician a call to set up an appointment, but I\u2019m too curious (aka paranoid) to wait until I see him."

I can\u2019t ever get medication into her. As she vomits. We had to resort to rectal medication. Which she understandably hates. \n\nWith the PFAPA she vomited so much she eroded most of her  teeth away. \n\nMy questions is though. Why does she vomit with each fever and is she likely to somehow grow out of vomiting with every fever?\n\nF. Aged 5. Medical conditions PFAPA and asthma . Asthma medication"

He's unable to seek help himself as he gets anxiety even thinking about taking steps to recovery, also he does not have insurance (California). I'll try and follow up best I can to any other questions you might have. Thanks in advance."

It takes a toll on me because I need to end up cancelling plans the whole time I\u2019m sick and especially bailing on work. I don\u2019t ever get the flu shot, because my parents always told me it\u2019s better to let your body be exposed to these things as I\u2019m young and healthy. Last year I even got it twice: one normally and one stomach flu. I\u2019m sick and tired of having the flu every single year, because it takes a toll on me and absolutely ruins a whole week out of the year. Itnormally happens on my birthday is the funny part, and yesterday it happened on my brothers birthday. It sucks cause our whole planned weekend with our family is ruined now and I just want to cry. My main issue is work on Monday. I got the job 1 month ago, and took of next Thursday and Friday for a short vacation. There is no way I can call out Monday because of this, I just don\u2019t want to risk losing my job. Are there any quick fixes for this- I can\u2019t sacrifice much more especially since this might happen again to me in the winter. Is there a reason this keeps happening to me? It\u2019s out of my control but I eat healthy, exercise enough, and keep my body in good shape. It takes the life out of me every time I have to go through this and right now I feel like death, where I don\u2019t understand how I\u2019ll be able to walk into work on Monday. Please someone help for now and let me know what I can do to prevent this in the future!"

About a week later I got pretty sick as well.\n\nAbout two days ago my vagina started getting itchy and there's a slight burn, but nothing painful.\n\nToday my boyfriend told me he had symptoms in the last few days. Light pressure/discomfort when he pees (also not painful) and whitish discharge.\n\nI'm 99.9% certain he didn't cheat on me and I definitely didn't. We both got tested when we started dating 1 1/2 years ago and were clean and I had another routine check up about 2 months ago.\n\nI'm thinking it might me a bacterial infection triggered because we both got the flu and our immunsystem couldn't fight it properly?\n\n28 years old\nCurrently living in Australia\n1.70m tall\n70kg\nFemale\nSmoker\nNo medication\nHad bacterial infection in the past (feels similar this time, but no smell yet)"

        "reddit": "Background: I\u2019m a 17 year old female, I\u2019m 5\u20194, and about 130 pounds.\n\nI broke out in hives yesterday morning (which happens randomly, but I\u2019ve gotten multiple tests and I\u2019m not allergic to anything). I took a Benadryl, and went back to bed, however, I kept feeling super anxious while trying to do so. Once I woke up and got moving, my heart felt like it was racing and I just felt so jittery. Usually Benadryl knocks me out, so I was confused. Later that night, my hives flared up again, and I took another Benadryl. My anxiety was through the roof all night, but the Benadryl eventually knocked me out. When I woke up, my heart was pounding so bad again, and I went to urgent care to ask for any kind of medicine besides Benadryl. My heart rate was 115, and I felt like I was having a panic attack. I cried in the room waiting for the doctor, and eventually I was seen and I was brushed off. Is there anything I can do to make this feeling go away? Is this Benadryl related?"
