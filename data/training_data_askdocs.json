        "I've been having a pain between my left shoulder/neck for 8 weeks. There was no injury that I can recall. It can get as bad as 8/10 on some nights, and I've considered going to the hospital. The only thing that worked was an opioid. Sometimes the pain feels like my shoulder bone is being eaten alive by something!!\n\nI just saw an orthopedist, they said it was a muscle strain in my left trap. He prescribed an NSAID and PT. I declined a steroid shot because I wasn't sure, but maybe I should have taken it. \n\nPersonally I think the problem is more serious: I've had to miss work because of this pain, and frankly it's been rather constant at times, even at rest. Recently it's popped up more on the right side of my neck. I feel as if it must be a deeper issue, and not a simple muscle strain. I just can't live like this. I'm going to lose my job if these pain attacks keep happening. \n\nI've been thinking lately about how metastatic/lung cancers can spread to the shoulder, and honestly I just want the peace of mind of knowing that whatever this pain is, that it isn't going to kill me in the near future, because that's what it feels like sometimes. \n\nI'm thinking of calling their office, mentioning the right shoulder pain, and asking for an MRI referral.

I'll wake up every  3 hours at night and need to eat.\n\n\nAfter feeling like this for 2 months, I saw my doctor. She suspected diabetes it hypoglycemia because they run in my family.\n\nDid all sorts of tests and the cane back Negative.\n\nBlood glucose: normal.

I have combination skin with dry patches, and also have Keratosis Pilaris. When I remember the issues with these \u201cbeads\u201d started to bother me, I was not on any medication or birth control. I was approx 13-14y/o. My hair is currently approx 22in long, is fine and wavy/straight (more straight now with the weight of the length), and is regular thickness. I do get frizz around roots and a little lower. \n\nI do sometimes suffer from dandruff flakes, mainly around my hairline and hair part. Not always though. The little \u201cbeads\u201d are not always present, but tend to be if my hair starts to get oily or after 2 days since I last washed it (despite my hair usually not looking gross and it only being a little bit oily). If I leave washing my hair for too long (3-4+ days, thx depression) my scalp does start to get itchy. They are not lice eggs/nits and I have never had lice. I have had it looked at in the past, but it was brushed off since it wasn\u2019t that. \n\nI\u2019ve noticed that typically when I hit a period of depression and am not washing my hair as much, this tends to be a thing. I also have been wearing my hair back in a loose ponytail to sleep and majority of the day to keep it out of my face as my acne has been living its best life :~) . When I remember being bothered by it most (when I first remember it starting / really bothering me) I used to twist and pin my hair up overnight very often to get more defined waves/curls. I think this could have some correlation. \n\nI have also noticed in the last 6mo or so, my hair has been shedding like crazy. I notice when I part it or pull it back, I can see the colour of my scalp a bit (although nothing super crazy that others would judge per say). I can\u2019t tell if it\u2019s stress, hormones (got my kyleena late September 2018, acne has come back swingin\u2019 since), product buildup or something else \u2014 and if this correlates with these little beads. I don\u2019t typically use any product at the top of my hair if any at all after showering (I usually just use shampoo and a hair mask on my ends or conditioner). \n\nIf you have any ideas of possible causes, things to check/test or things to bring up with my GP (and/or dermatologist when I see her), please let me know.",

It is circular and slightly raised. The strange thing is that it comes and goes. The spots here today will be gone tomorrow but there will be new ones elsewhere. Up until today the rash was not itchy. It also doesn't appear to be contagious, he shares a room with his brother and they randomly swap beds. \n\nWe have been to the doctors twice. Our family doctor thought it was an allergy and advised claritin and gave us a steroid cream. The claritin originally worked, but the spots would just show back up the next day. Now the claritin does nothing... The steroid cream take the spots away but more just show up.\n\nThe second doctor (a doctor in our clinic, our doc was away) thought ring worm. That doesn't make sense to me as we have dealt with ringworm with our older child and this is nothing like it. She gave us an anti-fungal, but when I took it to the pharmacy to pick up, the pharmacist told me it was not recommended for children under the age of 12. So I just bought the OTC anti-fungal cream.  But it is doing nothing. \n\nI am going back to the doctors this week, but was wondering if anyone had any ideas on what it could be.\n\nA few bits of extra info: \n\n* I have checked his bed and all our beds for bedbugs MANY times\n* We were at a beach with swimmers itch on July 14 (but everyone I speak to - including my doc - think it should have cleared up by now if it was that)\n* We haven't changed any soaps nor has he tried any new foods\n* He did have a dairy intolerance as a baby until 2.5, but can take it now. He was tested for cows milk allergy at 9 months but came back negative\n* No one else in the house (6 people) have any sort of rash\n* He has not been sick in the last 3 months\n* All his vaccinations are up to date. He has never had chickenpox but he has had both doses of the vaccine\n* He is other wise completely happy and full of his normal energy\n\nThanks for reading!",

        "38/White Female, 5\u20193\u201d and 120 pounds. Location: PA, USA. Duration of complaint: as long as I can remember. My chief complaint is being exhausted all the time with a associated brain fog. Not just a little tired, but debilitating exhaustion to the point where I have barely gotten by in school and work. I have been diagnosed in the past with narcolepsy and ADHD in the past and have been prescribed modafinil in the past. I am presently taking Adzenys. I have some doubts about my narcolepsy diagnosis, because a second sleep study ruled it out. I do believe that I have ADD (inattentive type) due to a severe lack of focus, despite putting forth maximum effort. I credit the modafinil and Adzenys with allowing me to function as a normal human being at work and in my personal life. When I do not take these medications, I usually can not get through a day without taking a nap, even after 7-9 hours of sleep. During the weekends I take a drug holiday from all stimulants and during this time, I have severe brain fog and am completely exhausted. My fianc\u00e9 has taken notice that during the weekends, I have a lack of focus, I need extra naps, and that I gravitate to higher carb foods and caffeinated beverages to get quick energy. I have complained about this in the past and this complaint was brushed aside because it\u2019s so non-specific and probably an annoying and expensive work up. I am also told that many women my age are diagnosed with something called \u201cMiddle Age Woman\u201d syndrome (how quaint). I\u2019ve had some lab work and Anemia has been ruled out, my thyroid is fine, and my CBC and BMP are normal. The only thing elevated was my Epstein-Barr level and honestly, who hadn\u2019t had mono? I have depression which is being treated with Lexapro and it has helped a lot. I also was recently diagnosed with interstitial cystitis. Elmiron has really helped with this and occasionally at night, I will take a short acting oxybutynin which has also been helpful. I work out about 3-5 x/ week (when I have the energy from being on meds) and eat a generally healthy diet (when on my meds). Associated symptoms include weird pains that are like right under my skin - like not my skin itself and not my muscle. I believe another name for this is allodynia. The pain is usually in my upper back and my upper arms. The pain is  weird and annoying but not excruciating. I have moderate to severe seasonal allergies which I treat with a steroidal nasal spray and Zyrtec. When my allergies are bad, my skin will itch and I\u2019ll become very congested. Sorry for the long post - I know it\u2019s a lot of information and I appreciate whoever is reading this. I am getting desperate because I feel like I\u2019ve been dismissed by many providers. I really do not want to have to rely on stimulant medications if there is an underlying condition that could be fixed. I know that I\u2019ll probably be on Adzenys forever but I want to be able to function as a semi - normal human and not be debilitatingly exhausted during my drug holidays.",

        "If you can solve this I'll owe you heaps of Reddit Gold so high that you can swim in it like Scrooge McDuck. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm 40 years old, male, 5'9 tall, caucasian persuasion, and fitness is my profession. This has **been going on for two years,** with little improvement and zero diagnosis despite being seen on the regular by two MDs and a Naturopath. \n\n**Symptoms:** \n\nI have abdominal bloating, sometimes slight tenderness, but more often than not just a sense of feeling completely full despite not having eaten or eating a small amount. Then at other times I just have tons of gas, minimal bloating, but a burning sensation in my abdomen below my naval. I poop regularly, once a day, but I can have an urge to poop almost any time of day after that where I don't really have to go. I sit down sure that it'll happen this time, but my bowel is already empty. It doesn't matter what I eat, and having various tests I am not allergic to any known foods. I can have a chicken taco with the typical toppings and a margarita and feel absolutely great, and then a day or two later eat the same thing and get \"the bloat.\" I haven't ever had diarrhea or constipation for more than one or two days in between. Nor have I ever noticed any blood in my stool. \n\nThe biggest factor for me is that sometimes this abdominal pain really hurts. I'm a tough guy and can take a lot, but this wears on me and takes the wind from my sails. Sometimes I feel so fatigued I just don't go out, do the bare minimum at work, or often cut out early to come home and rest. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Little back story:** \n\nAs far back as I can trace these symptoms, it's pretty clear they started on or around June 14th 2017. In March/April of that year I had a serious affliction with bacterial based pneumonia. My house flooded at the time and it was the middle of the night. Without access to a pump I saved the house by siphoning water into the lower basement from the garage into the drain in the laundry room. While doing so, I swallowed a bunch of ground water. Afterwards I spent almost 12 hours bailing water by hand in calf deep water. Wet and soaked I finally collapsed when Home Depot opened and I could buy a portable sump pump. Saved the house and within about 3 days I couldn't walk up those same basement steps. Went to the hospital and the found a mass of bacteria in my lungs causing pneumonia. I spent two days there and took antibiotics in the hospital. I nearly went septic and arrived at the hospital just in time, it was about to kick off a difficult time in my life but I didn't know it. \n\nTwo weeks later they had me check in again and take some kind of pulmonary(SP?) test. I wasn't out of the woods yet, so they gave me more antibiotics. \n\nI went sailing along through life, and as June rolled around I was smacked up side the head by finding out my wife of 11 years (dating for over 15) was having a prolonged affair with someone at work. It was June 6th, and I left the house for work, mad but sane, and ready to blow off some steam. Out of nowhere a drive with no turn signal broadsided me while I was driving straight. Luckily he had insurance, and copped to the whole thing. I was hit at about 40 miles an hour on an angle, I twisted in my seat and I hit the lap belt right where it comes across your lap on the right hip pretty hard. I didn't \"feel\" the accident after that and went about a typical day. \n\nOn June 14th while still living with the ex from hell, I ate dinner with a buddy at a dive bar we frequent in his neighborhood. He consoled me, I went home, and around midnight I had the worse case of acid reflux I've ever had in my life. Now some gut history, I have NEVER had gastric problems of any kind. All my friends had dubbed me the iron gut growing up because I eat anything you put in front of me. I love food and all cuisines around the world. I eat a whole food diet and never eat fast food of any kind, but I like sit down restaurants. So there I am unable to sleep with this esophageal burning sensation and my stomach is swelling. Eventually I get up to puke and it just seems like bile and mucous. Didn't really puke up the whole meal... at first I thought it was food poisoning but it seemed different. In about 3 days symptoms subsided somewhat but I went back to work. \n\nOver the next two months June-July I feel okay, but weak, and I have this burning sensation in my abdomen below my naval. I go to the doctor and they say I'm symptomatic for a bladder infection even though they can't find the bacteria. They give me more antibiotics. \n\nI feel great, August is pretty good. I meet a girl, we start dating. September is another story, I have day out Kayaking where I have to turn around after immediately launching the boat. I feel dizzy, and all of the sudden super bloated. \n\nI demand something be done, and ask for an endoscopy and have to wait until November to get the consult appointment. I show up, and the GI Doc brushes me off. Take Prilosec, and hands me over the counter tablets and to come back and see him in six months. I can't figure out why it wasn't as informative as I had hoped, turns out my loving ex wife forged a court document to remove me from our insurance. So there office just thought I wouldn't be willing to pay for the procedure or have the means to do so. Still charged me $400 just to talk to the doc. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Back to the accident:** \n\nbecause of the accident, and my symptoms, the car insurance company scanned my abdomen. I have had two ultra sounds, and an mri. Structurally all muscle damage has all been ruled out. One of the ultra sounds covered all my organs as well, and started my MD down the path of looking into my gallbladder. That lead to a HIDA scan and turns out my Gallbladder is rock solid and has great ejection function. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**To the naturopath:** \n\nFrustrated with western medicine and the continued mystery, I switch MDs, and I go find a naturopath. She does a SIBO test which shows a slight positive for methane dominant SIBO. I'm on the bottom of the scale so she gives me anti fungal support in the form of highly concentrated garlic capsules and probiotics. I SLOWLY start to feel better! I seem a little less food reactive after about six months of this treatment. I still run into the mystery of this food works great today, but hurts tomorrow. I eat a mix of reduced grains, bone broth, sushi, and just protein and plants on a plate real simple. \n\n**The new MD:** \n\nThings are kind of working, I still have low energy days and a desire to cut out early from work. It's my own business too and I built it over the last 10 years, it's my pride and joy so I'm not used to being lazy with it. I go in for my annual checkup and he catches me talking about my stomach again. He was the doc who ordered the HIDA scan for the gall bladder as well. I briefly mention SIBO and he says, easy, we'll give you the antibiotics for that, no harm no foul. Let's see if they work. AND I'll schedule you for an endoscopy and we'll move forward with that. \n\nThe antibiotics make it worse! It was like a hard reset back to the worst symptoms from two years ago. I was given Neomycin and Rifaximin and only did 8 days of a 14 day treatment because I felt miserable. I didn't ever have a moment of relief it just hit me hard by the second day and I tried to stick with it. Called my doc and he agreed that I should stop the antibiotics and go another route. \n\nToday I dropped off the biggest stool sample kit you've ever seen to check for C.Diff (I don't have diarrhea), parasites, colitis and some other things I'm not sure. I have the endoscopy consult in two weeks in case those don't turn up anything. \n\n**Back to the Naturopath:** \n\nI followed up with he ND after the antibiotics ran it's course and she suggested I do some other stool panel to check imbalances in the gut. It's pricey, $359 but It'd be worth it if I get some kind of conclusion right? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd that's all I can't think of at the moment.. I guess I'm just venting here, it's been a huge roller coaster ride and the mystery is weighing on me heavily. I realize that might not be solved here on reddit, but maybe you could tell me if I'm headed in the right direction. \n\nThanks for reading through all this and any advice in advance, it's beyond appreciated.",

I drink 8 bottles of water a day. Been drinking water like that since 2014. I started noticing light spots on the backs of my thighs in 2016. Soon they crept down to my legs . Then eventually they were everywhere. I have had 3 different Dermatologists and 2 biopsies thus far. 2nd test was sent to some special lab in Atlanta,GA. My current doctor wants to do a 3rd biopsy. I don't see the point. All the tests have shown negative for everything. First doc thought it was some form of lupus. 2nd doc thought it was some form of yeast infection or excema. Now this 3rd doc thinks it's vitiligo and wants me to start doing light treatments twice a week at\u00a0$500\u00a0a pop. What am I rich? I have absolutely no other symptoms. No itching, burning, peeling or flaking. It has always just been a cosmetic issue thank god. But now that I can't hide it under my clothes anymore it's affecting my self esteem. Back when these spots made their debut is right around the same time I was initially diagnosed with Type II Diabetes. The first meds prescribed was Metformin. I really think it has changed my body. I started having all kinds of gut issues that I never had before. Got so bad I had to go to the emergency room. I could barely walk everyday the pain in my abdomen was so bad. Doc said my body wasn't taking well to that medicine so switched to Victoza. Got well but went right back to gut issues. Then switched to Trulicity and Jardiance. I still have gut issues from time to time but not half as bad as it was when I was on Metformin. My dermatologists have proscribed the following creams: Topicort 0.05%, Fluocinolone 0.025%, Triamcinolone Acetonide 0.1%, Desonide 0.05%, Desoximetasone 0.05% and Elidel 1%. The last doc also had me try ointment: Eucrisa 2%. None of these meds have worked. For each of them I tried it out for 2-3 months only on isolated body parts so I could monitor and contain any potential adverse affects. I have also tried home remedies like apple cider vinegar and selenium sulfide 1% to rub on affected skin twice a day. I've also taken orally Diflucan 150 mg 3 doses 1 tablet every 3 days. Did that a few times. No change. I don't believe this is vitiligo. Seems vitiligo is more akin to patches of light areas instead of tiny spots everywhere.\u00a0 I feel I need to also include a history of my skin conditions. Growing up I never had issues with skin as a teenager. Never had much acne only the lonely pimple maybe once a year. In 2007 I moved to FL for a year and then came back home to AL with weird blisters growing all over my face. Local clinic tried to tell me it was a form of HPV. Didn't believe it at the time didn't start having sex until 2009. In 2008 a doctor diagnosed me with muluscum. Had it about 4-6 months. Doc prescribed Aldara 5% cream that was $300-400 for 12 doses per box and had to use 2 doses a day. I couldn't afford anymore after first box. It didn't work. Tried home remedy using\u00a0$4\u00a0bottle of Dr. Tichenor's antiseptic mouthwash on the blisters cleared it up in two weeks!\u00a0Smh. About that same time started getting boils all over my body. Didn't know what they were at first and let a few grow huge and painful. Had a few lanced at the hospital. Fast forward years later 2016 when I started seeing dermatologists for the spots also talked to them about the boils. Was told it's from staph infection. One doc said I should take bleach baths to keep the boils away. Tried it but stopped after a while just don't like the idea of bleach in my bath water. Another doctor prescribed Mupirocin 2%. I am to use directly on the boils. Also told to rub inside my nose daily to prevent them from forming. It works like a charm. But I assume I gotta use this stuff for the rest of my life? I have also tried using the Dr. Tichenor's on my spots. No changes. Ok hope I covered everything...Anybody seen this crap before? Any suggestions on treatments? I'm bout done paying money for doctors to tell me nothing and prescribe s every medication that doesn't work. \ufffd\ufffd",

I drank a lot of redbull and stuff before but monster was really the best. However, I noticed that if I drink a monster/rockstar after I eat hot food like chili con carne, about an hour later my stomach would rumble. It's not a serious condition at all but I would need to go to the toilet for relief. It usually lasts for 24 hours. \n\nI drink these stuff moderately too. One can a week. Only in Saturday when I can relax and game. And only once.\n\nIf I don't eat spicy food before drinking (or after for that matter) it's often fine. \n\nI also sometimes got the same symptom when I drink cold coffee in the morning. So I guess it has something to do with the caffeine. But it was not a regular thing with coffee so I don't know (not involved spicy food or whatever, it just happens when it happens). However with coffee it usually lasts only about 4-5 hours.\n\nThe stomachache itself like I said isn't serious. My excrement was still normal. My stomach just rumbles every 15-30 minutes and forces me to go to the toilet. Most of the time I simply had some flatulences.

        "20\nFemale\n5'4\n105lbs\nCaucasian \n\nSo a couple weeks ago I did an enema and felt a cold sensation of water trickling/flowing up through my abdomen. I was immediately in huge amounts of pain and sweating and shaking. I thought I was going to throw up and was extremely dizzy but after I expelled the water I was okay so I assumed this was normal. I recently started eating a lot more to try to gain some weight (I'm talking like eating every hour), and I've been having this same fluidy, water flowing down my abdomen sensation a lot lately. I have also been extremely nausous and have had this really weird abdominal pain that I've never felt before. it almost feels like heartburn in my whole abdomen instead of just upper. I'm not sure if it's related but I have also been running a fever off and on for a few days. anywhere between 37.7\u00b0c and 38.9\u00b0c though so nothing too bad. I've been experiencing very strange and uncomfortable symptoms for about a year now but haven't seen a doctor for many of them because I had a really bad experience years ago that scarred me (I'm sorry, I know you're not all scary). one of the symptoms being chronic GI pain. this water sensation doesn't just feel like my stomach is full and sloshing around, it's a totally different sensation. I can almost recognize it as how I think it would feel if you had a leak or something in your intestine and it was seeping into your abdomen. I know that's really specific but that's basically exactly how I think that would feel, so I'm somewhat concerned especially with all the strange stuff that's been happening to me lately. the only reason I know that is a thing that can happen is because it happened to a family friend years ago. her intestine had a small tear and leaked into her abdomen for I think a couple weeks or something before she finally got it figured out (if I'm remembering properly). Is this a normal sensation when you eat a lot or could I possibly be leaking into my abdomen or something like that?",

The nails began to crumble and fall out. They now never grow back attached and I have to keep them well clipped. If I even try to grow them back I seem to hit them off things without fail and the pain of the trauma of the small bump is absolutely agony and it's like they go \"Oh well :)\" and detach again. Even if I don't they'll find other ways to detach or just flat out not attach to the nailbed properly when growing out.   \n\n\nThe sides of the nails don't seem to want to settle and stay with the skin, so I think the shape of the nail beds must be ruined by it also. Also, the skin on my right palm peels constantly: it's difficult to see in the pic because I made the mistake of applying vaporub to them in a current attempt to try and get my palm not look so messed up so the oiliness is hiding the flakiness. They look disgusting and I just know people (girls especially) must look at them and go eww wtf don't want those filthy things near me. Any advice on what exactly it is and what I can do? I've been told it might be nail fungus but the online info about this for fingernails or what it is seems to be so limited. I'm not usually a self-conscious person about a lot but constantly seeing these and the agony of knocking them off things has pushed me to breaking point so I need to know how the hell to get rid of these things. I'm sick of being told \"Oh they'll grow back, just be patient\" Been told that years and they just won't; they refuse to.   \n\n\nSorry for the rant. Any help would really be appreciated.",

I feel miserable with this extra weight that doesn't seem to go away. I've heard it's impossible to lose weight if you have hypothyroidism. \nIs this true? Is there a way to effectively treat hypothyroidism? Are the success rates high? \nThank you so much",

I tried walking to the car by my self but I couldn\u2019t, The bottom of my feet were hurting badly. My brother carried me to the car. My family took me to the ER that morning and while waiting the numbness started going up my upper body and that point my body was numb and tingling, my body was even aching. In the ER, they did a spinal tap, blood work, urine test, MRI with and without iodine, CT scan with and without iodine. EVERYTHING CAME BACK NORMAL. \nI lost all control of my muscles and they even used a catheter because I had no control or urge to go. \nThey tested for MS, tumors and guillian barre and there was no sign of them. \n\nFast forward to the next day and a neurologist came and decided to take a lucky shot with IVIG and i started moving my legs little by little. I was given 5 doses of it (20 ml each day). However, they were still testing my blood for any viruses, inflammation anything. But everything is normal. \n\nI had to go to a rehab facility for 3 weeks for physical therapy which helped out a lot. I was discharged and started seeing a neurologist at kaiser who started testing for more things and everything is normal and was told just to exercise and continue physical therapy. \n\nAs of today, my body is somewhat numb(slowly going away) and I\u2019m more mobile now. The day before this happened, I worked out and went to work and came home and slept. I had no illnesses before except an ear infection which I went to the doctor for and got antibiotics (I didn\u2019t finish the pills though). I wasn\u2019t complaining of any pain. I\u2019m very active and I worked out 5 days a week and I try to eat healthy. I took the flu shot in January which they said, it was too far along for me to get these symptoms. Also, I did nerve conduction/EMG test and came back normal. \n\nBut I\u2019m just confused... why can\u2019t I walk? What happened? Is this going to happen again?\n\nToday, I felt numbness again and I'm scared, please help!!",

        "60/M \nWeight-115\nHeight-5'8\"\nLocation- Pennsylvania(Texas born), liver, kidneys, pancreas, heart,lungs,esophagus, basically most organs.\nConditions- liver failure stage 3(goes between 3-4), kidney issues, pancreatitis, gallbladder disease, esophagus ulcers occasionally, emphysema, pneumonia, congestive heart failure occasionally, diabetes occasionally, copd, Hep C, TB inactive, theres more I'm sure. \n\nMedications- advair discus, albuterol inhaler (prescribed meds but won't take unless narcotic which they won't give him anymore)\n\nAlcohol/smoking/illegal drugs- yes, alcoholic, drug user (heroin, clean for 3 months but goes in and out), smokes regularly. \n\nEverything in the title is true to the best of my knowledge. He seriously has all that stuff and it's all chronic. I mainly want to know how unusual it is that he's still alive (knock on wood lol) and what the reason could be. I have been reading this sub and when I see things about liver failure the case always seems dire and serious. \n\nWhen I was a baby my mom noticed my dad was yellow after tanning. She told him he needed to go to the er. He went and was diagnosed with liver failure caused by hep c,  he was 35. His belly swelled up, he was weak, thin, and sick, it scarred me for my childhood seeing that much illness and spending that much time with him as a 2 year old in the hospital. He was given 6 months. A few months later his stomach got so swollen it busted. From the belly button(I know this is crazy but he really has no belly button, there is a stitched line across his stomach where it used to be). That night his stomach busted they told us to go home, that he'd be dead by morning. My dad told us that he \"was freezing cold in the bed waiting to die when something covered him up and told him it was okay and he was warm again. We came back the next day and he made a turn around. He stopped drinking, his liver function went back up (still failure but not impending death failure) and for a few years we did well, dr had him on milk thistle and other meds and he did good. Then 4 years later he started drinking again...a lot. Over the next 10 years his liver was constantly getting worse then better. At this time the main issue was internal bleeding and free bleeding also. Any little cut and he bleeds like crazy. His esophagus would open up with ulcers and cause internal bleeding after a weekend of heavy drinking and had go to the dr, have a blood transfusion or something, recover, get lectured that he only had months to live if he didn't stop. Then leave and the cycle continues. \n\nFast forward 2008. Hes using drugs again (he quit when I was born after 20 years of heroin use), he is as healthy as he can be as a alcoholic, smoking,drug addict with liver failure when his house catches fire. He escapes after jumping out a window but not before getting burns on his hands and smoke inhalation. His vocal cords were damaged and he now speaks with a raspy, gruff voice that no one can understand. He now has emphysema from the fire. Not helped by him smoking still. He literally smoked the day he was released from the dr. He now gets pneumonia a lot. Like he actually has a bout of it now. He is terrible at taking antibiotics so he usually never fully recovers. Pneumonia is a regular thing for him, monthly during summer, bi weekly or worse during winter.\n\nWhere we are currently is a mess of different illnesses that come and go. Diabetes doesn't run in my family. He has diabetes when he has drank so much his pancreas and liver can't take his cramp anymore. His sugar drops and he will collapse and have to go to the er. This is rare but happens if he drinks a lot of liquor. He has pancreatitis now and then. His kidneys aren't bad, one barely functions but the other is fine, no dialysis but impaired functions. He has bad emphysema and copd. He hasn't had bleeding in a while. The congestive heart failure is only present during severe pneumonia,  usually in the winter.\n\nThe explanations by drs about his survival are, stubbornness, miracle, some are like...how?, others wonder if it is a birth defect he has, liver choristomas? Somehow providing blood flow better to his liver.\n\nThe docs described his liver to us as having so much scar tissue that it is like a painted sponge. I should also note he's not the only member of his family to survive serious illness for way longer than expected.  His brother shot himself in the stomach playing Russian roulette and lost part of his liver, stomach, spleen,pancreas, and developed mouth cancer and stomach cancer but lived for like 15 years. We don't know how.  He man literally smoked through a stoma and poured beer in his feeding tube. Who does that?  His sister just got her leg amputated from basically diabetes cause by severe drinking. \n\nThis is true to the best of my knowledge. I can try obtaining some records from him, perhaps I can even get him to do a video interview to put it on YouTube some day but most days as you can imagine he's not feeling great. He says his liver functions aren't always that bad.",

Unfortunately, when I finished that shift, I was unexpectedly broken up with, after a long-term relationship.\n\nThat night I woke up feeling I had to vomit, but didn't.

Moreover, since I've been eating relatively little (a bowl of cereal Thursday, a bag of carrot sticks and 2 slices of bread on Friday, 2 apples and 2 slices of toast Saturday), I'm concerned about where this diarrhea is coming from.\n\nFirst of all, am I just stressed or might this actually be an illness (or both)?

I drink maybe 1-2 times a year, sometimes less, not often more.  Every time I have, I skip my 2 doses before and the first one of the next day. When I do drink it is not more than 2 or 3  standard hiballs, or apple cider. I have never had a negative reaction like what I have read some people have. The only negative reaction I have is that the next day I am in intense pain for pretty much the whole day, by the second day after I am almost back to \u201cnormal\u201d. \n\nMy questions are, is this enough to skip and reduce the dangers of mixing alcohol and opiates? \nIf it is is safe to maybe only skip 2 doses instead of the 3 that I have historically? \n\nI realize that there is no answer here that can know all the variables in my life, and I should probably ask my Doctor. The only reason I haven\u2019t is because I drink so infrequently that I honestly forget about it the few times a year I see him. I will try and remember for my next appointment. \n\nI also do know some of the dangers of long term opiate use, but I lived for decades without it in extreme pain. For the last 5-6 years I have been able to live a moderately normal life because of my medication. \nI will however read all comments and give serious consideration to all opinions including the ones I know will come saying to get off my current medication. \n\nThank you to anyone who takes the time to try and help me.",

        "This question is not about me, it\u2019s about my sister (22 F, height 5\u20197, weight 125, Caucasian, doesn\u2019t smoke or drink, relevant medical issues include history of endometriosis - treated surgically and with Lupron - and pretty severe vaginismus. Duration of complaint is 6-7 hours or so). \n\nShe had an IUD inserted on Thursday - the goal of the IUD was to see if it would improve her chronic headaches. This was the second attempt. The first time doctors tried to do the insertion, they couldn\u2019t physically do it. Apparently she has a very severe case of vaginismus (probably partially psychological, partially physical, as a potential consequence of endometriosis/surgery). This isn\u2019t surprising though, as she had horrible, horrible muscle spasms for months after her last laparoscopy that required baclofen to treat. She had the IUD inserted in the OR under anesthesia.\n\nThings seemed to be going alright for the first few days. Some cramping, but minimal. Now things have taken a turn for the worse. She had a semi-active day (just running some errands, nothing too strenuous) and in the evening she started having severe cramping/spasms. A small amount of bleeding too, but not very much at all. The pain is very intense. 20mg of baclofen and 600mg of naproxen barely touched it. Nearly an hour after taking the baclofen, she finally started to get a little bit better, to the point where she sat on the couch for a while in only moderate pain. She recently moved upstairs, and the pain is back and just as severe as before. She took additional Tylenol and it doesn\u2019t seem to be helping. She describes the pain as similar to when she had spasms post-surgery, but maybe \u201ca little different\u201d (isn\u2019t in a state to elaborate on what this means). \n\nHere\u2019s the thing - she has a history of *severe* pain, and a very high pain threshold. It takes a lot to send her to the ER. I think it\u2019s only happened once before. My family is starting to think an ER visit is necessary, but she\u2019s resisting for two reasons:\n\n1. Her history of severe vaginismus is a confounding factor so it\u2019s very hard to tell what level of pain is \u201cnormal\u201d\n2. She\u2019s convinced that if she goes to the ER, they\u2019ll insist on taking it out. She doesn\u2019t want to do this because then the whole process of getting it inserted in the OR would have been a waste (and she wouldn\u2019t have even gotten a chance to see if it helps with her headaches), and also because the process of removing it would likely be quite painful and traumatic without the help of some heavier-duty anesthetic. She can\u2019t even have a normal pelvic exam (inserting one finger causes severe pain). I have no idea how someone would remove it. \n\nShe obviously hasn\u2019t been able to check the string either. I\u2019m at a loss of what to do. She\u2019s determined to ride it out, but she\u2019s been sobbing for hours now and I\u2019m getting desperate.",

I have had days on which I went to the toilet 10 times in an hour while lying in bed, trying to fall asleep, only peeing tiny amounts, but I still keep having the urge to empty my bladder. I have had to do a miction diary for my doctor and so I had to measure the amount of pee I urinate, and it sometimes was only around 20ml.\n\nI also had to wake up at least once per night to pee when I didn't have holidays from Uni. Since I usually go to bed at around 2am now, the first time I wake up and have to pee is at around 7am, and from that point on I have trouble falling asleep again, because my bladder fills up too fast for me to ignore it until I can fall asleep. But when i do fall asleep, I wake up around once an hour because I have to pee again, until I am fed up and annoyed and don't try going back to sleep anymore.\n\nI am in treatment because of this since 2 1/2 months now, I have to use a device that sends electric impulses towards my bladder using a vaginal probe (hope that is the correct translation) twice a day since 2 1/2 months. My therapy ends in 1/2 month and for now I can say it didn't do anything for me.\n\nMy doctor checked if my  bladder really emptied when I go to the toilet, and it does, so that is not the problem. I also usually don't drink more than 1,5 - 2 liters per day, and I rarely drink tea or sodas because I know that makes me have to pee even more often. Peeing also doesn't hurt, so my doctor said I don't have a urinary tract infection.\n\nHe told me I could have some kind of \"rare disease\", but didn't bother to tell me what disease that would be, and instead just prescribed me to do this electric impulse-therapy. I haven't seen him since my therapy started and he told me we would talk about medication when my therapy is up and hasn't improved my situation, but I would like to hear some other opinions on this.\n\nIt really impacts my sleep and thus, my overall mood. I don't want to wake up in a bad mood just because I couldn't sleep well/long enough, and I don't want to think \"is there a toilet?\" every time I want to leave the house. I also feel embarassed having to pee so often when I am around friends/my family, because it is simply not normal. I used to make jokes about it for a long time, but since my problem got worse over the past few months, I am just desperate for help and some answers at this point.",

        " \n\nHi, already asked a question here earlier this year concerning a skin biopsy (to diagnose eczema).\n\n**Short version:** check pic, scar after skin biospy after more than 7 months. what i can do, i don't care about how it looks but more about how it feels now ! you can't see well on the pic, the skin of the scar is elevated compared to the rest of my skin, and it's big like a tarentula. colour: dark pink/purple\n\ni moisturize it often.\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/M2Awn8z](https://imgur.com/a/M2Awn8z)\n\n**Details**\n\nI shall mention that my surgeon ( Plastic, Reconstructive, &amp; Aesthetic Surgery ) has taken a really huge amount of skin from my elbow. I've had to do the biopsy twice, first time there was no scar at all (it was good after a few days from the biospy).\n\nI can put here the measurements of the skin sample.\n\n10 days later, my wound was still open and not good at all, so he gave me a gel to apply and a silver something to cover it with, and i had to go back to his clinic to get stitches for the 2ND time (first time i had 3 stitches). It was really painful to be honest, and he seemed to put a lot of effort to get it done ... lost of blood on the sheet.\n\nso:\n\nbiopsy:\n\n10 days later (actually 2 weeks i think): stitches for a second time\n\nthen he said leave it for more than 3 weeks.\n\ni called him after 3 weeks to tell him that it seems it's scarring and perhaps i shall remove the stitches before it is too late (and sent him pics over whatsapp of the progress). he said no, but my dad is a nurse and we saw that we should remove them. i did so, with sterilized tools etc, it was sooo hard because the skin was dried and the stitches inside the skin ... i had 3 stitches \"outside\" and 1 long inside that is solvable and doesn't need to be taken off.\n\nseriously, if i left them for one hour more, i would have rather kill myself than a doctor trying to remove them (the stitches were quite tick too, and in a VVV form, so it took time to be able to remove them).\n\nand he said not to move my arm at all, so when i started moving it back (after 5 weeks of not moving) it was painful and tough !!! couldn't move it properly for a long time !\n\nanyway, biopsy in january, now in august it is like this;\n\nin reality it is even uglier, purple colour and visiblle and like a stain on my elbow (although its level is higher than the rest of my skin, and it is hard when i press on it, as if there was a cardboard in it if you see what i mean) the skin around this \"scar\" is very thin, i already have eczema, but usually not a lot on my elbow, but i have to scratch it often (perhaps because there is no more enough skin), and it's weird and painful because the scar can't be scratched, and then skin around it feels like i'm scratching my bone :/ if it comes in contact with something (not the scar, the skin that is on my elbow bone, near the scar), it is absolutely painful. I hit it a bit (just by passing between 2 passengers), and jesus :(\n\nand i can't use my arm properly to for example put it on the table and lay my head on my hand.\n\ni feel there is \"something\" on my elbow and i need to remove it. not sure how to explain it.\n\nso here i am to know what i should do ? is there any solution for that ? i am really frustated, i don't need another issue on my body that bothers me all the time. The shape and colour are okay with me, i can live with it, but the rest is annoying really.\n\ni would've gone to my initial surgeon and asked him to fix the issue for free since he created it, but i am afraid\n\n1-he doesn't want to and says he charges for it\n\n2-he doesn't know how and makes it worse\n\n(just checked his professional website, he says he does fillers, botox, threads, intimate surgery bla bla (lots of things listed))\n\n20F, white, no medication, 5'2'', 120 lbs\n\nthank you loads.",

I did a few standard tests- a holter monitor for 48 hours and a echocardiogram. Nothing significant came back so my doctor ordered a tilt table test. Due to work and schooling I wasn\u2019t able to do it until this summer. So end of June I do the tilt table test. \n\nThey put me at a 75 degree angle and for the first twenty minutes nothing significant happened. After twenty minutes they give me nitroglycerin to try and induce symptoms. My heart rate skyrocketed and I passed out. Apparently while I was unconscious it got to the point where they were no longer able to get a blood pressure on me and my heart stopped beating for 15 seconds.  I also projectile vomited while I was unconscious. \n\nAfter this I saw the on-call cardiologist and he cleared me to go home after they ran fluids on me. I saw my cardiologist and she has referred me to see an electrophysiologist who I will be seeing at the end of this month. I\u2019m currently wearing a Ziopatch for 14 days. \n\nI take Daysee (birthcontrol), Lamictal and Vraylar medication wise. I have asthma and bipolar disorder. \n\nDespite seeing two cardiologist they really haven\u2019t explained to me why my heart stopped beating.

        "22 - Male - 1.90 - 80 kg - White - 6 months - Penis, mouth and around my anus - \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDear redditors,\n\nFirst off: I'm not from the US. I'm experiencing a real annoying problem for about 6 months now. It started with a red area around my anus and it was also itching a lot. I went to the doctor with it and he prescribed me an anti-fungal cream: it helped and the symptoms were gone. \n\nThe other things I started to notice were that my penis was very dry and also had a really bad smell coming off of it. On top of that, I had a bad smell coming from my breath and it almost had the same smell as from my penis. I didn't think the smell in my mouth would be that important so I only went to the doctor for my penis at that moment. He prescribed a number of anti-fungal creams and also Vaseline. The moments that the anti-fungal creams were applied, the problem seemed to be solved, but if I stopped for one day it would be back immediately. Then I started with apple cider vinegar: drinking 2 tablespoons mixed with water twice a day for two weeks and pouring apple cider vinegar over my penis twice a day for a week. After this the problems were completely gone, in the meantime I use Vaseline about twice a week. Incidentally, the stink breath also went away because of the apple vinegar.  \n\nNow 3 weeks after having stopped drinking apple cider vinegar, some of the symptoms are back. My stink breath and the stench of my penis are what it was again, on top of that I'm getting the itch back around my anus (mostly the are between my buttcheeks). The drought has not returned: this may be related to the fact that I apply Vaseline twice a week. I also went to the dermatologist, who indicated that it was about eczema, but that appears not to be the case since the apple cider vinegar stopped the symptoms from both my breath and my penis.  Could it be that I have a fungus that is hidden deep in my body? That apple cider vinegar prevented it but is not enough to wipe it out completely?  I would love to hear how you view this.",

        "Hi,\n\nI used to have Delayed Sleeping Phase Syndrome in high school, and took melatonine to get a more regular sleeping phase again.\n\nAs an adult, I still sleep quite poorly but I am able to function pretty well in the standard 8 hours to sleep, 8 hours to work, 8 hours for travel and free time scheme.\n\nHowever, I occasionally just find myself completely unable to sleep. I am not tired, I am not stressed out or worried about anything, I just.. don't get tired, as if it was still 2 PM. And so, I just don't sleep that night, and instead watch tv, read a book, go on reddit, etc.\n\nI used to try to force myself to sleep in this situation when I was younger, e.g. closing my eyes, laying still, clearing my mind of any thought that come up, meditating, etc.. but that would just mean me lying there for 8 hours, similar to you lying on the floor of your office building during your work and trying to just fall asleep.. if you're not tired, it's just 8 hours spent waiting. So I've stopped doing that.\n\nThe only problem I have then, is that the following day I'll get tired around 1 PM, as in \"I'm about to fall asleep any second now so there is no way I'm going to drive a car\" tired.\n\nI then just try to keep myself awake until a normal hour, say 10 PM, so I'm back to my normal waking hour at 8 am the next day.\n\nBeing tired during the day aside, could this have other side effects that I haven't taken into account? If so, how should I deal with simply not feeling tired at all?\n\nInfo:\n\nAge: 29 ( diagnosed with DSPS at 18)\n\nSex: male\n\nHeight: 1.9 meters\n\nWeight: 85 kg\n\nRace: Caucasian\n\nI do not take any medication, I stopped using melatonin at age 20.\n\nI do not take any recreational drugs, although I do drink a lot (4-5 cups) of coffee in the morning to be able to perform at my high-complexity job.",

I\u2019ve had episodes of these issues scattered throughout my life, but this instance has been the worst by far. From last Sunday to this Thursday, I was almost completely unable to defecate. It felt like something was stuck in my rectum and I couldn\u2019t get it out. The only stuff that managed to come out was this very thin, gelatinous, clear-ish mucus that had liquid feces in it. Throughout the week I tried taking Miralax, and when that didn\u2019t work, I resorted to a glycerol suppository. That didn\u2019t work either, it just gave me really horrible gas. This went on for 5 days until I went to the doctor, who told me to take ex-lax, which she claimed works like a charm. She told me to take two sections of the chocolate bar, which I did. For hours upon hours, nothing happened. Every time I felt like I had to go to the bathroom, it was just a lot of gas and a bit of that poop-mucus. I was getting frustrated at this point so I went to bed on Thursday night and when I woke up in the wee hours of Friday morning, it was like Niagara falls coming out of my butt. Well, even though it worked, I still have horrible diarrhea even as today is Sunday. It\u2019s like I went from one end of the spectrum to the exact opposite. There is still a LOT of mucus in my stool, I have horrible gas that won\u2019t let up, and if I press down on my lower right abdomen where my intestines are, it is very painful. What can I do to improve my state? My butthole is burning from the pooping and the wiping, and I\u2019m exhausted from getting up every 10-15 minutes to use the bathroom.",

I did not faint  or vomit, but I felt very weak for a few minutes  after.\n\nWhen it happened and ever  since, I've felt a bit like my whole scrotum is compressed and  everything is 'jumbled up' inside, there is this strange feeling a bit  like they are still being squeezed. I feel this small pressure at the  back of the scrotum where her fingers were squeezing.\n\nThey are not red or swollen, and it's not exactly what I'd describe as painful. They are ok to touch and the whole thing works.\n\nBut as I said, it feels like they are still being gripped even after such a long time.\n\nI've  been reading a lot about some different injuries and from what I  gather, if it was something serious I would already be in a lot of pain  by now. But on the other hand I'm feeling very anxious about it.\n\nIs there anything I can do to recover quicker? Is it ok or should I visit a doctor? Can I have some advice? Is it normal to still feel awkward  after over 1 day?",

I looked this up and seemed to be some kind of overeating/bile reflux thing that is quite common. So I experimented with drinking things to make my stomach more acidic, which didn't help, then more alcali, which didn't help. This may have been misguided. Not eating for periods didnt clear it either. When I cough some up it is kind of thick saliva.\n\nToday I remembered having a check up a couple of years ago where I was given all clear after I had felt a lump while inside my throat while touching beyond the back of my tongue. It occured to me that this might have grown so I reached into the back of my throat in the same way.\n\nThis is when I realised that I was not able to reach into my throat in the same way as what I now realise is the epiglottis prevented me and it was difficult to reach in and check this, whereas it used to be very easy.\n\nNow it seems the same mechanism is what has been causing this issue with my swallowing.\n\nIs this potentially something serious?

Unknown when it started.\n\n**Location:** Between Canada and Austria\n\n**Existing Relevant Medial Issues:**\n\nExcessive urges to pee frequently &amp; Nocturia\n\nExtreme anxiety issues (Going to therapy) I was properly diagnosed but I am legally not allowed to know the name of the condition at the moment due to a really long ass story that doesn't need to be mentioned. However I'm under the impression it's a personality disorder.\n\nExcessive tiredness\n\nMotivation Issues\n\nRequiring usually 10 hours of sleep\n\nFrequent passing out in cars or when sitting too long\n\n\\*\\*\\*As a child I went to childrens hospital because a doctor heavily overdosed me on Dexedrine for years (70mg), I was skin and bones and grew into puberty the moment the pills were out of my system\\*\\*\\*\n\n**Current Medications:**\n\nMetrohexal Retard 47,5 MG (To keep my heart remotely under control)\n\nImplanon (Contraceptive)\n\nVenlafaxin 75Mg (Anxiety Meds)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Situation:**\n\nI am omitting a lot of details including like 6 medication changes but we already confirmed they have nothing to do with this so, to keep things short....\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nComplained of tiredness and exhaustion. Going upstairs or waking up almost qualified as pain. I did not exercise at the time but it just seemed excessive and something was wrong. Got an Oximeter, discovered my heartrate averaged between 130-160 just standing or walking around. Monitored this and my bloodpressure for months. Oxygen was constantly perfect. I averaged at about 140 BPM for most of the day every day. But would frequently fluctuate to 160. Keep in mind I would not notice at all when it went high, I was completely obvious to it, I would've had no idea if it wasn't for the monitor.\n\nI even made footage of me waking up, with my heart at 80bpm, putting my heart monitor on and climbing out of bed. It climbed to 140bpm in about 30 seconds.\n\nCompletely changed lifestyle, exercised every day, extremely strict diet w/sugar caffine ect, virtually every aspect of my life was monitored and experimented with. No change.\n\nInvestigation escalated and a mountain of tests were done. I was finally sent to the hospital while at 190 BPm just standing around. It went back down to about 130bpm and I was in shock how much the hospital was panicking about it because this was my normal for like 5 years.  I was given a quick acting betablocker for the first time and cried my eyes out over how much clarity and calmness it gave me. Since then it keeps my heart from surpassing 160bpm and was the first time I'd ever in my life seen my heart anywhere near the 70bpm range. However it still averages at about 130.\n\nAfter the beta blocker I also gained about 10 pounds.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThyroid check, nothing\n\nDiabetes check, nothing\n\nHeart echo, Nothing\n\nCystoscopy, Nothing\n\nXrays, nothing\n\nBlood tests, at one point Iron was a bit low but I was having a period that was lasting over a month at the time. Period stopped, my bloodtests showed iron was back to normal.\n\nECG, nothing outside of obvious tachycardia no irregular heartbeat or anything like that.\n\nElectrolytes, nothing\n\nCancer/tumor/cysts, nothing\n\n24 Hour Heart monitor, confirmed I was at least going down to 80bpm in my sleep\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCardiologist said that it must be psychological and pretty much ended the investigation. As I do have bad anxiety issues, however when I went to an extremely qualified psychologist she said it was virtually impossible for tachycardia like this to stay so consistently from anxiety, at most being short bursts.\n\nPsychologist wants me to investigate further because something is obviously wrong but we don't know where to turn next.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am currently a bit weary of exercise. I have a bike and it always immediately jumps to 160. Since I got the beta blocker it doesn't feel like pure agony but I still worry I'm playing dangerous games trying to exercise. Is it safe/recommended right now?",

No current medications aside from those mentioned and tylenol, no smoking, moderate drinking, \n\nAs said in the title, I went to the Doctor last Sunday with some swelling and pain on the left side of my neck, slightly below, and around behind my ear, with a bit of pain in the ear itself. Went to an urgent care clinic, as I have no insurance, and am in fact visiting a friend in a different State (Ohio)  Was told it could be an abscess beneath the skin, and asked to apply hot compresses and come back the next day in the hope that something would emerge and could be drained.\n\nThat didn't happen, and the doctor then put me on a prescription of  Cephalexin 500 mg, taken four times daily on this last Monday. The doctor had been planning to put me on something else, but after I mentioned that I'd had an infection about a month prior, for which I'd been prescribed Sulfamethoxazole-TMP (Generic for Bactrim)\n\nI began taking it, but almost immediately began having serious side effects. I felt sicker, dizzy and light headed, my head ached, and upon taking the medication I began to have periods of my heart beating very quickly, and severe panic attacks.\n\nIt was mostly the latter, as it was getting bad enough I really could not stand it, that I contacted the clinic about the side effects that were occurring, and they asked me to come in again. Got in, saw a different doctor, who looked me over, quickly (Actually the same doctor I'd seen for the prior infection of the navel) who told me that the reaction I was having might have been to the \"buffer\" or inactive ingredients in the Cephalexin.  He also seemed to think, after looking at my ear, which has large, red patches behind it on both sides, (Note-These are there regardless, I'm not sure if it's scarring due to prior skin infections, which I've had behind both my ears before, but it's red and nasty looking even when it feels fine.) that it seemed something due to cellulitis, whereas the previous doc had thought maybe a deep tissue infection.\n\nRegardless, he gave me permission to discontinue taking the Cephalexin, and instead, prescribed me yet again Sulfamethoxazole-TMP, which I've been taking since Wednesday.\n\nThe issue is, now, the feeling which before, had been more of an ache, and surface level, has gotten \"deeper\" it's less painful, but I can almost literally feel stuff behind my ear draining, though the ear itself is generally clear, without wax any wax at all, and strangely sort of \"Wet\" sometimes and my cheek on that side had swollen a bit. It tends to get a bit better during the day, when I'm upright, and I've almost felt normal, but I've been having serious trouble sleeping, and every time I do wake up in the morning, I feel as bad or worse than before, before it gradually gets a bit better throughout the day. Still, despite not running a fever higher than 99.1 a time or two, and more generally just more like 98.4-9 (My usual baseline is a 97.6 or so)\n\nWith these seriously uncomfortable things, I can't shake the feeling that either due to me not being specific enough, or those red patches looking generally nasty, that I might have been misdiagnosed, and as I continue to take the antibiotics without the ear \"draining and fullness\" feeling, and the slightly swollen cheek going away, I'm worried that I'm waiting out while something else is potentially getting worse.",

I have inflammation everywhere in my body with high wbc and c-reactive of 24. \n\nI've been tested for lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, and sjogren's syndrome, all negative but I've had positives in all 3 several times. More negative than positive though.\n\nInflammation is bacterial but I've been on 4 antibiotics this year and nothing has helped.\n\nThis pain started July 2011, about 8 weeks after brain surgery. Started in my stomach and now it is everywhere. \n\nHere are the doctors I currently see that are clueless as to what is going on:\n\nPulmonologist - swelling around my lungs and states that it is starting to go around my heart. Put me on a med that starts with \"C\" but can't remember what it's called. Hurts to breathe and feels like I'm stabbed if my body is touched around it. Swelled especially around my sternum (something called an odd name with an \"x\" \n\nGastroenterologist - my duodenum is highly inflammatory so I got put on the fodmap diet. It helps but inflammation will not go away. Had 2 polyps removed from my upper intestines that were too big for how old they were since I had the same test done last year and now have to have one next year from it. I also have internal hemorrhoids if that matters. \n\nCardiologist - my heart rate raises very high easily for no known reason. Tilt table test is inconclusive because I raise only 28, not 30. But I can't do stress tests because my heart rate jumps to over 200 in less than 6 minutes. I pass out if I get too hot so I can't do too much outside. I had a test where they checked my muscles and my right side is weaker but that is probably because I had brain surgery on my left side. (temporal and occipital lobes removed) \n\nENT- Swollen lymph nodes in my neck on the right side for over 3 years. Pain is getting worse. Will possibly need surgery to remove the worse ones. \n\nGynecologist - lots of pain so blame is endometriosis which probably makes sense but it hurts so bad. I was stage 3 two years ago and need a hysterectomy. \n\nUrologist - kidney and bladder pain. Just had a huge kidney cyst removed and my bladder tied up. Lots of pain in these areas for 6 years. \n\nFoot and hand doctors - several surgeries have been done to remove hard lumps and to reset my feet. I grow lipomas and cysts like crazy in these places, along with my back and arms. Right now, my feet and ankle are swelling if I even try to walk and they feel like they are going to break. I was told it was my tendons swelling and she had no idea why - it had to be from something else. \n\nNeurologist - seizures are coming back 8 years after having surgery and it's probably from the stress I'm going through with all this. \n\nAll my doctors except gyno are telling me I need to go to the Cleveland Clinic to figure this out. My whole body hurts so bad and I hate that nobody knows what is going on. \n\nWhat kind of doctor should I even see in Cleveland? I'll be referred to a pulmonologist but I don't think that will help. I need to get this figured out soon because I'm pretty sure I can't take this much longer. I just graduated from college and I want to work and have a normal life. Please help me.",

The ringing subsided after a few hours but since then I've had a constant feeling/sensation of something being in my ear. I went to my primary doctor a week later and she thought it was allergy related and suggested trying an antihistamine. I used Flonase for a few weeks without any signs of improvement. I went back to my doctor in May and she thought it could be a possible ear infection and prescribed a round of antibiotic and prednisone. Unfortunately this also did nothing to relieve the sensation/feeling.\n\nI went to an ENT in the middle of July (had to wait 3 weeks) He checked my ears, (no excessive wax buildup), performed a hearing test (hearing is normal in both ears) and did a pressure test (both ears came back normal). \n\nI have noticed that when I have small burps I can feel a pressure buildup in that ear like it wants to clear but cant, and sometimes there is a small pop.

I went to a doctor before for the cough, he gave me PPI and antibiotics had a X-ray that was all clear from lungs, heart and bones. Should I go for a different doctor that specializes on bowel movements instead? please tell me your thoughts.

When I was 17 I was sitting in class and I started to feel suddenly nauseous, I asked to go to the nurse and I started walking down the hall. On my walk to the nurse's office I then started to get extremely sweaty and pale; then all the freaky stuff started happening, (none of this has happened to me before) my vision out of very quickly got blurry and everything lost color, my ears started ringing incredibly loud but my hearing was extremely amplified, besides the ringing    I could hear my heart beating clearly, the churning of my stomach, and echoing of conversations happening in the classrooms I was passing. Also the only thing I was able to feel was the contents in my stomach, I could not feel my feet hitting the ground when I was stumbling, it was like I was floating.\n\nFinally, right before I thought I was going to go unconscious and fall face first, all color suddenly returned, my hearing returned to normal, feeling came back, and all of this made me throw up in my mouth a little. I eventually made my way to the nurse's office and when I got there I wasn't able to comprehend was just happened yet, all the nurse did was check my pulse, listened to my chest (told me my heart was beating strongly) and sent me on my way with an apple juice. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNothing like has happened before and I have no true (physical) medical history however, I have a feeling it was due to my stressful lifestyle, at the time I was joining the volunteer fire department, lifeguarding, school was going pretty rough, my current job was way too dangerous of a job for a 17 year old (I used to drive a small boat to transport goods to a beach community, even in storms I had to go), and the big kicker, I have been clinically depressed for 3 years prior to this event.\n\nEver since this day my speech slurs occasionally, I get headaches often, its hard to focus, and my temper has been a lot shorter. I think it's linked to this event but I'm not sure... Maybe I just need a vacation.",

I am recovering from an eating disorder but I dont think it is to do with that. My fear started when i was young with meat and things (vegetarian) and now I cant be in the same room as people with most foods. When I worked at a restaurant I had to state i would not wash dishes as I am terrified of other peoples foods. One time they made me wash up and I had to go outside to throw up. When I was collecting dishes from the breakfast bar I would feel so physically ill that sometimes I would just hide instead of doing it. Washing tables was awful aswell as polishing cutlery. Working there made eating out for me now impossible. When my boyfriend is eating infront of me i feel sick and make him brush his teeth and wash his hands. I will freak out if there is food crumbs anywhere. Some of the worst things are meats and ketchup and liquidy foods or things with chunks. Its getting worse and worse over the years. It only got this bad when I was in recovery but Ive always had a thing about meat and smells (autistic spectrum disorder) and ive always been fussy about textures and wont eat most foods (wont eat meats, dairy, breads, most sauces ect.) but this is something that ive never heard of before? There isnt anything online about it. Ive heard of people hating chewing sounds which i also do but its so far beyond that. Anyone know anything about what could be wrong??",

        "20, female, 5\u20194\u201d, 160lbs, white, complaint duration is about 3 days so far, location on body is my right upper inner calf. I had high-ish ldl last time i had a health assesment (i was at 115 where i should be around the 90\u2019s) but other than that no other medical issues. Non smoker, no drugs, no meds. \n\nSo a few days ago i noticed a pain in my right upper inner calf area- it felt like a bruise almost and the pain area was about the size of a golf ball. It was a bit tender to the touch, and my veins seemed more visible on that area on my right leg than my left. At first i thought i strained it while working out (i\u2019ve been bad at stretching before i do cardio) but it felt more like i hit it than pulled something. I can move my leg and foot with no pain, it\u2019s just tender if i press on the area. \nThe thing i\u2019m most concerned about is that i can\u2019t see a bruise, nor do i remember whacking my leg on anything. It does seem to be getting less tender so i probably have nothing to worry about, but i figured i\u2019d ask anyways. I was worried about a blood clot in my leg for a bit but i don\u2019t have a family history as far as i\u2019m aware of blood clot issues or anything, and the area has not been red, warm, or anything else that google said would be a symptom of a clot (but i\u2019m not a doctor nor is google.) \nI read a little about bruised muscles being a thing but again i don\u2019t recall hitting my leg. \n\nAgain, it\u2019s probably nothing and i\u2019m probably overreacting, but i figured if i don\u2019t ask i\u2019m gonna worry about it more. Should i be worried/ is there anything i can do to help the healing process (ex. Go easy on my leg for a bit?)\n\nUpdate: it feels almost like the pain is moving? Maybe i\u2019m being paranoid but it was originally more on the side of my calf and now it feels like its moving to the back of it?",

        "21 year old male here 5\u20198\u201d  \n\nI don\u2019t understand  what happened last night. At 10 AM, I grabbed a cup of coffee with only 35 mg of caffeine. I haven\u2019t had any caffeinated drinks in months at that point due to high sensitivity to caffeine and I didn\u2019t like the crash. But I used to drink 50 mg-100 mg and felt fine, jittery on the higher end of the spectrum though.\n\nSo I slowly sipped the coffee with a blueberry muffin and bottle of water that I downed with it. I felt fine, felt really good actually. Well at 2 PM, I vaporized some marijuana for the first time in a while and took some CBD oil with it to relax myself. I hadn\u2019t had any marijuana in a week at that point so i had a really low tolerance but I was feeling really good, just playing video games and relaxing. \n\nWell at around 6 pm, I felt the caffeine crash kicking in so I had another couple of hits from my vaporizer. I\u2019ve also been drinking a bunch of water all day because I keep getting thirsty. \n\nWell 2 hours later when the high wore off at 8 pm, I really started getting hit. I got a headache and slight nausea for a while before it hit me like a train at 8:30 or so and I was in a full blown panic attack/crash/sickness/whatever it was. It felt identical to a bad hangover; weakness, nausea, headache, sinus pressure, anxiety, feeling really cold... I felt so cold once it hit me like a train that I thought I was dying and it sent me into a panic attack which only made it worse. I had to lay under the many blankets in my bed for 20 minutes or so to get my body temp back to normal. \n\nThen it was about 2-3 hours of rocking back and forth trying to avoid going into a full blown panic attack and trying to stay awake because I felt so weak and sick that I thought I was dying like I said. These are all the exact feelings that I felt when I had a horrible hangover a couple of months ago as well. \n\nIt could potentially have been food poisoning on top of those two because I cooked chicken for dinner that turned out a little funky. It wasn\u2019t pink or anything but you never know. I definitely threw it all up that night and then felt a lot better after that. \n\nAnyone have any idea what happened so I can prevent that from ever happening again? I will stop drinking caffeine if that\u2019s what it takes. I didn\u2019t think 35 mg would do anything... i got a small cup with 1/4 of it regular coffee and 3/4 decaf coffee. I\u2019m just not understanding what is doing this to me... is it a panic attack or is it a caffeine crash or is it general sickness? Food poisoning?",

My doctors don\u2019t know what to tell me. I keep getting worse and I\u2019m super bummed right now.\n \nI had my first hypertensive crisis when I was 22. 200/130 for no damn reason. They\u2019d happen a few times a week and be pretty normal in between most of the time so the first few years everyone thought I must have some kind of anxiety disorder, even though I didn\u2019t feel like I had anxiety. My life was dope and I was otherwise super healthy and happy.\n \nThen I got pregnant and shit got bad. My blood pressure was still super labile but seemed to get higher throughout the day. Like 100/60 in the morning and 180/120 evening. After delivery (healthy baby!) the blood pressure stayed shit and my heartrate also began to get weird. It would get stuck at like 160 for a few hours just sitting around. Diagnosis- being a mom is stressful.\n \n \nIt wasn\u2019t until an echo showed left ventricular hypertrophy that a doctor acknowledged it might not be anxiety. Much bloodwork found super elevated renin and aldosterone. Losartan stabilizes my chronically low potassium and helped the numbers a bit. \n \nOn top of the BP stuff, my left kidney hurt like a sonofabitch. I peed blood sometimes and it felt like a rusty fork was permanently lodged in my left flank. It ended up being renal nutcracker syndrome. Had surgery in October to transposition the vein and IT CURED ME. No more high blood pressure, normal heartrate, my foggy head cleared and I didn\u2019t need to sleep so much, no more pelvic and flank pain. It was pretty great.\n \n \nFor a month... And then the god damned vein scarred shut and everything came back worse. The general consensus was that the occluded left renal vein was causing low perfusion pressure, raising renin, raising aldosterone and angiotensin, causing the crazy BP swings. The blood that should have been going from the kidney to the IVC and up to the heart was refluxing down into the ovarian vein and pelvic plexus, causing low cardiac preload, tachycardia. Makes sense!\n\n \nSo we cut out my fucking kidney on Monday. I guess my body had created tons of weird little inefficient collateral veins so it was a thing but all went well and my numbers were decent in the hospital so I came home Tuesday.\n\n \nBut my blood pressure and heartrate have steadily climbed the last few days and I feel worse than ever. Just laying in bed, my numbers used to be low, like 100/60, HR 50s. But not they\u2019re like 150/110, HR 130. It won\u2019t go down. I\u2019m talking my meds, drinking plenty of water. Wtf is wrong???\n \n \nMy doctors don\u2019t know what to tell me. I\u2019m scared and angry and don\u2019t understand how I could possible get worse by cutting out the problem.",

        "I went to the pharmacy to check my blood pressure, we got an electronic blood pressure machine it said 200/140, she got shocked as I was feeling okay, she tested it manually and confirmed the reading and sent me to the hospital. I go the hospital and they mention it's 130/90 and they mentioned it was most likely due to the stress of the previous reading.\n\nFast forward couple of months my parents come to visit me, my mom has hypertension and she checks regularly, asked for me to check to see. We check my blood pressure about 30 times, once is 130/70 once its 200/140 my dads and my moms reading are correct, we go the to the doctor she says it's 115/70, I have no clue whats going on. We're using a traditional machine manually checking for the pulse.\n\n25 Years Old, Male, 1.84, 82kg, no medical history or feeling of complaint. I did a heart checkup and it was fine a while back(4 months ago) as well as my blood tests.\n\nI am so confused, how can so many people get false readings? Is something actually wrong?",

        "Hello! I\u2019m in India right now visiting family for a wedding and on the way to the reception (in the car) I felt a pinch on my foot. I was wearing flats, so the top of my foot was exposed (though I was wearing socks), and a really long dress. I was half-asleep (jet lag and the drive was, like, 30 minutes long) so I just shrugged it off, but when I came to a few minutes later I looked at my foot to see what the deal was. I didn\u2019t see a bat anywhere near it. \n\nI\u2019m concerned, though, because when I went home I found two little holes (raised somewhat) right where I felt the pinch. It was itching throughout the night, so I thought it could\u2019ve been a mosquito bite until I saw the two punctures.\n\nI feel totally crazy, though, because this would\u2019ve happened in the car, and since there was no bat in the car on the way back, it would\u2019ve had to have clung to my dress and then flew or fell off when I got out of the car on the way there. \n\nI thought it might\u2019ve been a mosquito that tried to bite me through my sock twice, but it doesn\u2019t look like my other mosquito bites at all. Both scenarios seem kind of far-fetched, but I am especially worried about the bat one because of the high risk of rabies in India. I also see all kinds of bats (small, big) flying around the city at dusk. \n\nI am 24 years old, Caucasian, have OCD/GAD, worry about bats a lot, am in Hyderabad, India for 10 days, and am having a really rough time. \n\n(I will attach a picture as soon as I have WiFi...)",

I didn\u2019t feel comfortable since the moment I changed and the doctor made me feel stupid. Anyway, as soon as the examination for the Pap smear started he basically told me I had cancer and I felt terrified. I came back with my results and he said that I shouldn\u2019t worry because the tests came back negative. \n\nBecause of this experience I felt bad and kept avoiding going to the gynecologist. However, because of my first ever yeast infection last month and also because I was diagnosed with chlamydia, I\u2019ve been seeing my doc regularly. I told him I wanted to get a Pap smear done since this new doctor makes me feel safe, and he asked me to bring my old results. \n\nSo, I just took the time to analyze my results and I feel like the first doctor was irresponsible. I have an appointment set for Tuesday but I can\u2019t stop crying and feeling worried. This is what the test found:\n\n- Positive Schiller Test\n- Endocervix: white epithelium\n- cervicitis\n- \u201cd/c\u201d mild dysplasia (d/c stands for rule out or ruling out, I\u2019m translating from Spanish as I\u2019m Peruvian)\n\nSo I\u2019m not sure if he found the start of cervical cancer or not. I have the pictures of my colposcopy but I\u2019m not sure if I should post here. \n\nAlso, lab tests came back negative for abnormal cells. No biopsy was made. \n\nAny thoughts are appreciated.

I did not assume anything of it at first because i was close to the start of ovulation and had felt a slight, quick cramp not 30 minutes earlier, so i just assumed it was \"mittelschmerz\". Over the last 9 days the bleeding got slowly heavier, and now i would consider its volume to be like a very light period's. The color of the blood ranges from red (fresh blood) to brown or black (old blood). It doesnt stink the usual was periods do, just smells like blood.\n\nMy last period was on 11th July, lasting 5 days with heavy discharge, as normal for me, the next one is predicted to start at August 13th up to August 30th. My cycles usually last from 31 to 52 days.\n\nI am in a monogamous relationship and my partner and i do not engage in penetrative sex (nor naked rubbing or etc).

Over the past year i did get considerably fatter, but started losing roundabout 1 month ago (before the bleeding started).\n\nThis is the first time anything of the sort happened ever since i started having periods when i was 10. I dont have any other symptoms or mood changes accompanying the bleeding. I dont have my usual period symptoms (back pain, pms) either.\n\n.\n\nEDIT August 4th, late afternoon: just went to the bathroom. There was a visible spot in my pad (before this it wasnt enough to stain the pad). When i wiped a lot more blood came out, enough to be considered an average period's worth.",

I don't think my doctor has seen the results yet. I'm freaking out that I'm dropping too low and going to start having arrhythmias. I've also thrown out my back I believe, and get painful spasms of my back. I know muscle spasms are a symptom of low potassium. Do you think that is related? Am I overreacting?

        "Age: 22 \nSex: M\nHeight: 5'7 \nweight: 140lbs\nRace: caucasian\nDuration of complaint: 2 years\nLocation: neck, eyes\nDiagnosed medical issues: neck scoliosis, insomnia, dry eyes\nNo current medication, drugs or smoking\n\nTwo years ago, I noticed that my eyes would get very tired when i would stay too much in the sun or play games on pc. Also, my neck would hurt where the trap muscle meets that big vertebrae at the base of the neck, on the left side. I currently have a muscle knot there.\n\nThe nights following these symptoms, i would experience short and sudden movements of my arm right at the moment when i would become sleepy and close to falling asleep. This happened several times, which made me give up trying to sleep sometimes.\n\n\nAs time went by, i took measures to protect my eyes, because i thought that the tiredness of my eyes somehow affected my ability to fall asleep or to stay asleep. The measures were to decrease the brightness of my pc screen, watch less tv, wear sunglasses in the sun. After i did these things, i didn't feel my eyes get tired anymore.\n\nHowever, i would still struggle to fall asleep and so on. My neck started to become more and more tense, up to the point that my head and eyes would hurt, like a headache. So i considered the fact that my sleep might be affected by my neck problems somehow. \nI have to mention that right now, the muscles of my neck that attach to the base of the skull(don't know the name) start to get tired even if i lean my head forward for a couple minutes. Also, i can't tilt my head backwards, because my spine starts hurting.\n\nI realised that the more i used my neck during the day( reading with my head leaning forward, biking) the more issues i would have with falling asleep.\n\nI will give some examples of how the amount of effort with my neck corelates with the amount of symptoms that prevent me from falling/staying asleep:\n\n\n-moderate effort of neck muscles during the day (ex:doing desk work)\n-&gt; i fall asleep normally, but during sleep i have very vivid dreams. What the dreams have in common is that i dream stuff that panicks me..like someone close died, driving a car at full speed) Sometimes i wake up during the night after these type of dreams, when they are too intense. The rest of the time i wake up too early and feeling tired. Note that because of this, i can't sleep for more than 6 hours, not even on weekends or when i've had a rough day.\n\n- intense effort of neck muscles during the day(not that intense but more than moderate, for example biking for an hour)\nthere are more posibilities here: \n1. Can't fall asleep at all no matter how much i stay in bed, even if i'm tired.\n2. I fall asleep several times but wake up every time because of sudden, singular muscle twitches or because my body realises that i stopped breathing and wakes me up\n3. I don't experience any muscle twich or breathing stop, but i will have intense, panicking dreams that wake me up several times during the night.\n4. 2. and 3. combined\n\n-mild effort of neck muscles during the day:\n-&gt;i don't know, during these two years, i always had to do stuff that involves neck muscles (most things do) and didn't rest them for a full day.\n\nUp until now, i asked an ophtalmologist if if eye pain/strain could cause insomnia and said no. I also asked a neurologist if neck/eye strain could cause insomnia and said no. So right now i don't know exactly what condition i have, but i'm trying to massage my neck in order to get it back to normal, which doesn't really work. Apart from that, i really don't know what to do about this.\n\nThank you for reading!",

I'm able to go back and see the results online, and my red blood count, hemoglobin, and hematocrit levels are all within normal ranges. I have been diagnosed with Raynauds, but it's summer where I am. It might be helpful to note I am frequently cold, and so are my feet and hands. I sometimes get cold after exercising even on days like today when I ran and it was around 60 degrees out and I got a little warm. \n\nI am also getting an echocardiogram on Monday, which my doctor ordered as well, but mostly for peace of mind. I should also note (since I'm unsure if these things are related) my heart rate is around the 175-190 range, occasionally jumping up into the low 200s. However, I feel fine, maybe slightly tired but vision and everything else is fine, and I don't feel nauseous, lightheaded or anything. My resting heart rate has also been going down lately as well from mid 60s now to 57-59 BPM.\n\n\nAm I imagining blue lips, or could it be something else that warrants other testing? Any help is much appreciated.",

Although I've been to the doctors here, had many appointments, ultrasound, MRI, nothing has been diagnosed.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFrom what I have found online, the closest thing to what I have has been described online as a \"stuck rib\" (from Steve August, linked to [here](https://www.facebook.com/SupportgroupforCosto/posts/well-we-have-had-some-very-imformative-information-from-a-guy-by-the-name-of-ste/1903465316360385/)). His advice is the only thing that seems to help reduce the pain (and his product, the Back Pod, is very helpful too). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe thing is, the rib flares up on occasion from particular exercises, such as any kind of anti rotation, certain lower trap exercises, and any kind of grappling. Ideally I'd like to get back to grappling, but this injury is a real problem. Steve August's advice is there to help manage the pain, but from what I can tell there is no medical consensus on this type of issue anyway, so I'd like to find out what my options are with regard to how I can attempt to fix this? Its been going on for 3 years now and rest is just not helping.",

        "**General Info:** 29 year old female / 112 lbs / no personal history of bipolar disorder\n\n**Previous Medical Information:** I've always had anxiety and panic attacks and tried fluoxetine twice in the past (once in my teens and once in my mid-twenties). Both times I didn't experience side effects but the medication didn't do much either. Otherwise, I'm healthy and the only other medication I take is Benadryl for seasonal allergies as needed.\n\n**Family History:** Family history of depression and anxiety. One aunt who I don't know well has bipolar disorder.\n\n**Recent Problem:** I'm a tenure track professor and researcher. My job is pretty stressful. At the end of this past semester I thought I was suffering from burnout but when it didn't go away I feared depression and went to a walk-in clinic. My symptoms were lack of appetite, feeling fatigued and exhausted all the time, crying spells, inability to concentrate on work or be productive, and feelings of numbness and hopelessness. It had lasted about a month. The doctor prescribed Celexa. I was told to start at 5mg for two weeks and then gradually increase to 20mg.\n\nThe first couple of days I felt really nauseated and tired. I took it in the morning with food. I also had insomnia but took Benadryl to counteract this. The fourth day, I felt euphoric. I felt happier than I had in a really long time. I wasn't anxious going to the grocery store and was actually able to communicate with people freely without anxiety. I started to feel good about myself and had increased energy. I also had a higher libido. It matched the libido I had before I started to feel depressed. I was really happy about it but started to suspect it wasn't normal to feel THIS good on day 5. I didn't take my Benadryl last night because I figured I'd be able to sleep well since I felt so good. However, I didn't feel tired. I felt refreshed and wide awake and like I wanted to get some work done. At 5AM I realized that this really wasn't normal and had my spouse drive me to the ER. The doctor spoke to me for about 5 minutes and said I was experiencing a hypomanic episode. She said this only happens on SSRI medications if there is underlying bipolar disorder. She unofficially diagnosed me as bipolar, told me to cease taking Celexa, and prescribed the following;\n\n* ***Seroquel (antipsychotic) starting at 50mg and daily increasing to 300mg per night.***\n\nFirst of all, this drug seems to have bad side effects. Second of all, the 50mg they gave me in the hospital has made it so that I can barely function today. I feel sedated and my brain feels all muddy. I definitely don't want to take 300mg of this as I'll probably be non-functional and lose my job. I didn't fill the prescription. I'm waiting until Monday (tomorrow) so I can see my general doctor and also go to the mental health services place here to see if I can get a psychiatry referral. I don't feel hypomanic today at all. I feel like my episode was relatively mild -- no impulsivity, no delusions or hallucinations and I was still able to sit still and concentrate on a movie.\n\n1. Is this a high dose of seroquel for someone of my weight who tends to be sensitive to medications?\n2. Is having a hypomanic episode on SSRI medication always 100% caused by underlying Bipolar disorder? I haven't had hypomanic or manic episodes before.\n3. Is it safe for me to just discontinue the Celexa since it was only 5mg and I only took it for 5 days? I'm scared of withdrawals.\n4. Is it safe for me to wait until I see my GP before starting antipsychotic medications?",

They typically occur about once every 2 months or so since this \"episode\" has started. Ulcers are about 2-3mm in diameter, sometimes larger. They last 7-10 days and (until now) occur singly. They are remarkably, excruciatingly painful. They completely interfere with my ability to talk, eat, and drink. My (do humans have a submandibular LN?) lymph node near my jaw on whatever side of my mouth they are on becomes swollen. Pain radiates along my entire jaw. I've been reluctant to go to a doctor for such a self-limiting issue, but I have two for the first time, on opposite sides of my mouth, and have been completely unable to eat for the past two days. I'm now seriously reconsidering that stance. \n\nMy questions for you lovely medical professionals are: \n\n1) Should I be going to the doctor for a self-limiting issue? I do use mouthwash, topical benzocaine/lidocaine, etc... so if the recommendation is likely to be more of the same then perhaps it's better I not waste their valuable time. \n\n2) If in your opinion a doctors visit is recommended, is there any information I should be gathering prior to the appointment? I don't want to be unable to answer any relevant questions they may ask because I haven't been paying attention. \n\n3) What type of doctor should I be seeing? I initially thought a GP, but perhaps a dentist is better? It doesn't really have to do with my teeth though...\n\n4) Is it necessary to make an appointment when an active lesion is present? They are quite unpredictable and I'm located in a very populous area - I'm not sure how possible it would be to get an appointment on a \"short notice\" basis if that makes sense.\n\nHappy to provide any additional information. This issue is really starting to impact my quality of life.",

Over the years I've bounced between diarrhoea and constipation. The mirtazapine is definitely making me more constipated, I used to go around 4 times a day but now only once if I'm lucky and it's usually a bit of a hard one. It's happened before but never this bad, but today I ate at a buffet and had a small hard bowel movement after but on the car ride home I had the sudden urge to go and it was so incredibly painful I was almost hyperventilating. I'd compare it to severe menstrual cramps, it came in waves this intense pressure in my Colon. I barely made it to the toilet but every bowel movement was so painful. I'm just wondering if this is more than IBS. I generally get a pain in my lower right stomach or I get the pain in my Colon.",

It feels like the veins in my wrist are tight/itchy. It starts during the night and usually lasts well into the next day. It used to occur only rarely (after particularly heavy drinking nights), but lately (past 1-2 years) has been after drinking any amount of alcohol. It happens even if I drink a lot of water and have no other dehydration or  hangover symptoms.\n\nI googled and wasn\u2019t able to find any reports of correlation between alcohol and wrist pain.  Has anyone heard of this?\n\nThank you!",

As in, it's not there, I go to sleep, and it's there in the morning.\n* I have had my landlord set up traps for bedbugs, which have caught absolutely nothing (bed bugs or other insects) over a period of weeks. I also tore my bed, frame, box spring, etc apart in a moment of panic and have found nothing.\n* The worst I've seen in my apartment was a couple of small spiders over the last several months, or maybe a millipede or two in my bathtub (they're common here as I live in a city right on a huge lake). Actually I did see one beetle once, lol.\n* I usually get one of these before the last one heals; sometimes I get a new one day after day, other times I can go a week or two without seeing another one.\n* My detergents/soaps/etc are all hypoallergenic as I do have sensitive skin. I'm not wearing anything new/foreign when these pop up. The vast majority my clothes, especially ones I wear to sleep, are old.\n* When it starts to heal, a small spot becomes visible that does look like an area that's been bitten, or stung, or something. But I'm not a doctor, I don't know, maybe that happens even with certain rashes.\n* I previously did get diagnosed with dermatitis when using certain soaps, before switching to exclusively hypoallergenic items. I don't know if there are different types of dermatitis, but this is different than what I had then. The dermatitis was almost scab-like; these are not. (The scab-like dermatitis did completely disappear upon switching soaps. This was a few years ago.)\n\nRequired info:\n\n* Age: 30\n* Sex: F\n* Height: 5'8\n* Weight: 150\n* Race: White\n* Duration of complaint: a few months. 3-5. Sorry I suck at keeping track of things. I'm going to do a better job of documenting this so that I can get ready for a possible derm visit if I cannot fix this on my own.\n* Location on body: Random. Sometimes appears on arm, sometimes on leg, sometimes on back.\n* Any diagnosed medical issues: JME\n* Current medications and doses: Valproic acid for the JME, 1250mg. Have been taking since I was diagnosed at 14 years old so definitely not suspecting a drug reaction.\n* Any recreational drugs: No, haven't even had a drink since January.\n* Smoking status: No.\n\nThank you!",

Reasonably frequent bouts of diahorrea and constipation. Painful periods. Never been pregnant. \n\nSymptoms: Trace blood in urine for 6 months, difficulty urinating and voiding, more frequent urination, stinging pain with urination, some mild pelvic pressure/ache. No infection in urine from microbiology sample. No changes in weight or appetite, normal blood pressure.\n\nBlood test results: https://i.imgur.com/BWrNZiQ.png\n\nI first went to the doctor with a suspected UTI in late November due to pain during urination and increased frequency. I tested positive for trace blood and was put on antibiotics. The symptoms did not really improve but were not too bad.\n\n I returned to the doctors in late March because of painful urination and again trace blood was found and I was put on antibiotics for a second time.\n\nIn early June I had an unrelated allergic reaction and at the doctors I notified them my urinary symptoms were not improving. They again found trace blood and they decided to grow a urine culture to check it. The test came back negative with no infection present. \n\nI went on holiday for a month and on my return last week had blood tests another urine test, and another culture test. I've attached the blood test results (seems all normal). The urine test did come back positive for protein as well as trace blood. The culture test is negative again. \n\nI've been referred to radiology for an ultrasound next month but I'm going completely mad with anxiety about it in the meantime. They haven't really explained what they're looking for. They've told me I'll also likely next need a cytoscope test if nothing is obvious from the ultrasound. \n\nI wonder if anyone can give me perspective here about what might be wrong. I'm of course terrified of cancer (also there is zero family history of cancer) but I don't think I'm in the usual demographics for bladder cancer. However, Dr Google has really scared me and I have issues with anxiety etc. \n\nMany thanks",

        "Male - 23 - 6' - 257lbs - White - Right Shoulder Pain For 56 Hours\n\n**Cause Of Injury:**\n\nI tried throwing a frisbee as hard as I could and felt two pops in my shoulder. I felt 7/10 pain and warmness in my shoulder for a minute or so, followed by a dull ache, 3/10 pain, for 3-4 hours. I iced it up. No issues moving my forearm, but experienced pain when trying to move my upper arm in pretty much any direction.\n\n**48 Hours Later:**\n\nI have no pain at all when resting my arm. I still seem to have extremely limited range of motion when trying to extend my arm in front of me. Imagine there is a door handle that is just far enough away that I can only reach it by fully extending my arm... it would start to hurt as soon as I reach the height of the door handle, and I would not be able to move past that height without pain. Couldn't imagine trying to grab something off a shelf. Also, there is an area that seems to be quite hot to the touch sometimes (picture A), although there is nothing visually abnormal.\n\nI saw a video on testing for shoulder impingement, and the first test (the only I could do since I'm by myself at the moment) involves grabbing your opposite shoulder with the affected arm and then trying to move it upwards towards your head. This test was a positive (pain inducing). \n\nArea of Hotness: [https://i.gyazo.com/5ac644eda2b28b6dbc5c8c0bfa04845a.png](https://i.gyazo.com/5ac644eda2b28b6dbc5c8c0bfa04845a.png)\n\nArea of Pain: [https://i.gyazo.com/0daa4d9b6281ac7fcdfef2f7d1f2156a.png](https://i.gyazo.com/0daa4d9b6281ac7fcdfef2f7d1f2156a.png)\n\n**Questions:**\n\n1.

        "Hello all, thanks for considering.\n\nMy wife is a Caucasian 26yo female, 5\u20192 in height, 115lbs, no smoker, and takes spironolactone for acne.\nRecently she went to the optometrist since she had some irritation in both of her eyes, but primarily in her left. They prescribed a steroid and everything felt better.\n\nShe went in for a follow up, and happened to mention to the optometrist that she felt like her right eye needed a stronger prescription. She had been noticing it for maybe a month or so, and just figured her eye prescription needed to be strengthened. Optometrist did his exam and they found that no matter the lens, her vision remained blurry only in her right eye. Optometrist dilated her right eye and took a photo, but did not find any evidence of anything wrong at all. The optometrist stated that it was \u201cconcerning,\u201d and referred my wife to an ophthalmologist, specifically a retina center.\n\nI asked my wife to describe the blurriness. It was difficult for her to accurately explain it. She says that it makes the slightest difference when she wears her contacts vs not wearing any form of correction, but that her right eye is essentially not useful for reading at any distance. She can make out shapes and colors fine, and perceives light well (no darkening in the vision). She says the blurryness is almost as if she were looking through a streaky smudge. Left eye is completely unaffected. She has no other obvious symptoms. \n\nAny input would be appreciated. The uncertainty is very discouraging and uncomfortable.",

In the beginning, I noticed that my testicles were pulling up close to my body and seem to have lost some size. Then, I began experiencing a dull ache, mostly in my right testicle but this often spreads to the left. I also noticed that there seems to be some thicker tissue, almost like a lump on the superior portion of my right testicle. In addition, I have noticed that my ejaculate has become extremely thick, to the point it is almost painful to ejaculate. In addition, there is barely any ejaculate that comes out. I have been seeing a urologist about this issue and he told me to not worry about the sperm consistency (seems strange to me). He states that I have epididimytis. So far he has prescribed me two different antibiotics and two courses of prednisone (first it was prednisone, now I am on methylprednisolone). In addition I have had a scrotal ultrasound which was apparently normal. Since starting this Medrol pack the testicle pain has gotten even worse! I cannot have sex anymore and I have constant nagging pain in my balls. I really am at a loss for what is going on and I would appreciate a second opinion. It feels almost like my testicles are dying and it is extremely uncomfortable. In case it helps, I had several testosterone readings taken earlier this year that were low, but recently it has returned to mid-normal range. I would not be surprised if this pain had something to do with it. Any opinions would be much appreciated, help me save my nuts!",

        " \n\nMy dad got a very minor wasp sting that looks like a tiny pimple on his back. Some of the pain has receded hours after the incident, and he hasn't had any swelling, itching, or any of the other allergic symptoms, but mostly just a light stabbing on the spot of the injury. Is a tetanus shot mandatory? He is an electrician so I'm scared that this could potentially lead to tetanus. (IG electricians are exposed to this kind of bacteria?) He is asleep now, but last time i checked he was completely ok, and most of the pain had receded.\n\nAge: Late 50s\n\nLocation : Upper right back\n\nSex : M\n\nPrevious Medical Issues: None\n\nMedications: None\n\nDuration: Happened today\n\nHeight: 175 cm",

I haven\u2019t told anyone about it because I don\u2019t want to seem paranoid and waste anyones time... \n\nAnyways, so when I was playing around with my siblings, we sat down and started to play a game of catch randomly... My sister threw the ball way over my head, but my dumb ass still tried to reach for it... As the ball was going over my head, not realizing I was bending my back inward, I attempted to grab it by standing up quickly, but then I felt a small crack in my back, as it felt like I bent my spine inward a little too far. My back felt weird that current day, but I just tried to set my mind off of it and hope it got better the next few days... Well now every time I\u2019m in my bed trying to sleep, the mid area of my back up to my shoulder blades feels tired/tingling like its been stretching which makes it uncomfortable to sleep in most positions... Everyday I have the urge to bend over because when I walk, my back feels like its pushing inward and it causes a slight pain... I\u2019ve been putting up with it because its not all bad, but I would be lying if I never said I thought about it getting worse when I\u2019m a lot older... So I guess I should see a doctor just in case hoping its nothing too serious, but I would like to know what you guys think of the matter; if I probably fractured it or maybe this could cause permanent damage...",

She was feeling terrible pains in her abdomen so we went to see a public doctor, where they told her she had an inflamed intestine; take this shot and take better care is what was prescribed. Prior to seeing the doctor we were the \u2018google detectives\u2019 who thought we could find a diagnosis over the internet. We were worried she might have gallstones (even though the pain was on the wrong side), and that she might need to be operated. We asked the public doctor if it could be gallstones and she said no, it wasn\u2019t that. So we left the office pretty relieved. However, 1 day later her pains didn\u2019t get any better and we started to doubt the doctors diagnosis. A friend recommended a doctor by name, but had lost their phone number. Like the detectives we were, we went to the internet to try and find their contact information, and we did, sort of. We found their website through a directory (with out of date contact information listed), and their phone number wasn\u2019t listed on the website, so we wrote them an email and reached out on facebook. We waited 24 hours but never got a response, so we decided to go with a different doctor and got an appointment the same day. Immediately was told that she needed an ultrasound and was quickly confirmed to have gallstones. Dang\u2026 They told us if we waited any longer that it could have caused an infection and serious complications or death, and that she needed an operation to remove the stones. Great\u2026 Just what she wanted to hear.. Not. Anyway, we checked her into the public hospital with an emergency status from the doctor, and the surgery was done 2 days later. Recovery was pretty rough, but successful. Thankfully we had the intuition to get a second opinion, and not wait for the second doctor to reply. A couple days into recovery we actually got an email reply from the \u2018other\u2019 doctor saying they could schedule an appointment, and to call their office because email replies can be slow (you don\u2019t say).\n\nThis experience made me realize just how important it is to keep a website up to date, with contact information at your fingertips. I feel like I could have lost my wife if we had relied on the \u2018other\u2019 doctor to reply. If their phone number was listed, we could have called and seen a doctor sooner. So that\u2019s why I came to this community; I do web/graphic design for a living and want to pay it forward. I want to offer a free website evaluation if you\u2019re a doctor and have a website. I\u2019ll take a look at your website with my check list and give you feedback on what is missing, or what can be improved, you can do with that information as you please! Maybe it can help a different family in the future.\n\nThanks for reading.\n\nP.S. If this is the wrong place to post this, could someone point me in the right direction?",

It\u2019s about an inch to an inch and a half long.

I\u2019ve been having kneecap , patella pains since almost 8 years. These pains are not unbearable and avoidible If I do not do sometype of moves with my knee.\n\nIt hurts when I squat and worse when my hips are lower than my knees , like the position you would get if you were goint to poo on the bushes to grass. \n\nIt hurts when my heel touches my but. When I do that warming up move you all probably know. \n\nIt hurts when I am sitting and pushing the floor with my feet.  \n\nIt hurts when my knee is bent and when I am unbending it.\n\nIt starts to hurt when I sit for a while with my legs bent. (That\u2019s the worst one, long trips and trying to sleep in small spaces are very uncomfortable for me.)\n\nI have been to 3 docs about this.\nThe first one told me to place ice on it. Didn\u2019t seem to care much. So I\u2019ve been to another one.\n\nThe second one said something about the fluid in my patella and gave me exercises and continuity is the key telling me to do them for 6 months. I believe thats probably true but I couldn\u2019t do them for 6 months 3 times per day. \nThe main reason for me not doing it was that I could avoid the pain somehow and wasn\u2019t unbearable.\n\nThe third one didn\u2019t tell anything about what the case was with my knee. Gave me a sheet of exercises that has 15 exercises. But didn\u2019t even tell me how many reps-sets I had to do. I had to go back and ask him about it. But It almost took an hour and 20-30 mins to complete the exercises and had to do them for 3 times a day. I couldn\u2019t do it more than a week.\n\nNow I am interested in going to the gym and been going for almost a month. Squating and leg exercises hurts when I do them. It\u2019s bearable but hurts. \n\nI want help about what the case could be with my knee. The name of the syndrom-sickness? \n\nAnd what could be the best exercises for my knee? Which part of my knee-leg I should get stronger?\n\nThanks a lot If you had read all of it. It was a long post. I wanted to include a video about when It hurts but unfortunately I can not I think.",

I have a full rupture (bones are all good, as is (are?) the meniscus) of my PCL, and some additional damage to my MCL and ACLs - those seem to be healing well.  I play competitive roller derby 3-4 times a week and would like to get back to my sport and play for years to come.\n\nInjury background, previous recovery/issues, and why I'm wondering if I should get a second opinion on surgery:\n\nAbout 10 months ago I fell directly on my knee at the skate park (was wearing pads but it was still a gnarly impact), this is the US, healthcare is expensive and as usual I didn't go to the doctor. It coincided with a winter break in practices so I took several weeks off for rest and rehab and went back to skating in the new year. When I returned to game play, my knee wasn't the same. This mostly came up when I would \"take a knee\", meaning tap or fall onto my bent knee. This didn't cause a lot of pain, but it made my knee go \"offline\" for several seconds and getting back into the game took a few beats.  In most activities, this wouldn't be a huge issue but every second in derby is valuable. It's a fast paced game in which people are points and being out of position for a few seconds makes a big difference.\n\nEven with the occaisional \"offline\" issue, I got back to skating more or less as usual for a few months. This summer I skated in a tournament and came away with my knee in seriously bad shape. I couldn't sleep for the pain and just getting into my clothes, to the bus, and sitting at a desk was barely manageable. \n\nI finally got in to see an ortho a few weeks ago, got an MRI, and she told me that no one bothers to fix PCLs because the cost and rehab are not worth the small gains made by the repair. She said plenty of NFL players go without, etc and wrote me a prescription for PT.\n\nI've started going to therapy but I have nagging doubts about the level of recovery I'll be able to achieve without repairing the tissue. For one thing, no one I've spoken with has ever seen derby or knows what its demands are [gif to give an idea](http://nrgjo1ew3uj371d7gd9zm8r9-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018-championships-game-1-crime-vs-montreal-falcon-punch.gif) - to say this is a \"pivoting\" sport undersells it. We need powerful contact with the floor and fine control of the angles of our feet while [initiating, counter-blocking, or avoiding impact](https://twitter.com/texastravelteam/status/1157799875943313408) plus [jumping,](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/2e/de/57/2ede57315f1bb786be8532552c7eb336.gif) falling [down and recovering](https://media.tenor.com/images/5df12efba36f5c74bfc79451412cb8ee/tenor.gif)...it's a lot to ask of your body.\n\nMy primary goal is to get back to skating but also to be proactive about my knee health. I don't want to have arthritis in 10 years and all of the studies I read online seem to give conflicting viewpoints on the effectiveness of PCL repair. \n\nDoes anyone here have any advice or experience in this matter?",

I am Caucasian and from Luxembourg but study in the UK during the terms. I do not smoke and currently, take pantomed 20mg 1x per day for the gastritis.\n\n  \nI need medical advice for three things: I rather put them all in one post instead of three different ones think that would be better but correct me if I am wrong.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  \n1. The most recent one) I had a sharp testicular pain on the left side today while walking. I lasted only very short but stopped me from walking. Touching my balls did not hurt and there seems to be no swelling just a bit of paleness of the scrotum, as well as the softness of left testis. It feels softer than the other one. I doubt that it is a testicular torsion as from all the stories I heard and read it hurts like hell and stays, rather than simply come and go. The second time the pain came was about two hours later and while seated. Last time it happened I went to the urologists but they did not see anything at all. Also nothing from urinary tests. I still have scintigraphy to do on Monday before seeing them again.    \n\n\nFind attached here below pictures which I tried to take as well as I can, but it is hard since I do not have a big mirror or anything. Maybe you can see that it looks a bit pale in the middle and some places.  \n\n\nNSFW as a picture of testi as it is apparently required\n\n [https://imgur.com/a/YDTyYBP](https://imgur.com/a/YDTyYBP)   \n\n\n  \n2) I do sometimes have a sharp pain in the chest for a long time together with shortness of breath. Been to a cardiologist and my heart is completely fine eve under stress. The pain can be left or right side but always with shortness of breath and stabbing pain. I have been hospitalized not long ago and they found out that I have light gastritis and hatial hernia with reflux at the esophagus level by the gastroscopy.    \nMy thought was that the chest pain and shortness of breath can be due to the hernia, but two different GPS already told me that it is so small that it is insignificant and cannot be from there as the hospital did not even write the size of the hernia in the letter to him. What else can it be then?  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  \n3) Due to the different symptoms (e.g I had trouble swallowing before) I have done a lot of different CT\u00b4s and scanners lately. With the scintigraphy, I will be anywhere between 47-53 MSV in a month and 3 weeks more or less. Should I be concerned about developing cancer?    \nLast year I only had one chest x-ray. My last CT before that was in 2013.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  \nThanks for your time and answers to those who read it.",

When I was about 15 they slowed down a bit, instead of getting them every day I\u2019d get one every three days or so. But then just before my 16th birthday they picked up again. I went to the doctor and got my blood pressure checked, bloodwork done, cholesterol, sodium levels, etc checked. Everything was normal. They gave me something a bit heavier than Advil (I cant remember the name of it now) that helped for a bit, but then stopped working. I\u2019ve really given up on finding out the cause of my migraines now, I\u2019m frustrated because I\u2019ve been suffering for almost 6 years, and I\u2019m starting post secondary soon. These migraines have caused me to miss multiple days of school in junior high/high school, and I don\u2019t wanna miss time while I\u2019m taking a degree. What could possibly be the cause? Or is it something that I just have to deal with?",

        "Hi, 35 male from the uk.\n\nI had a spontaneous pneumothorax in my sleep about... 10 years ago which was fixed with a.. bullectomy / pleurectomy  i believe are the right terms.\n\nThen my other lung collapsed about 6 weeks later, and again.. same treatment.  To be honest i spent many weeks in hospital as they tried various treatments to try and get it to stay inflated. Eventually i had VATS and went home with an ambulatory bag.. eventually that was taken away and i was all 'sealed up'.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(this is 10+ years later i think now..)  \n\nYesterday i woke up, i had the most intense pain deep within my shoulder, like i imagine where the ball sits in the socket -- to which i immediately thought 'my lung has re-collapsed'  and i had sort of a chest tightness and a very slightly pain when i breathed in...\n\nIt was a really severe pain, but it was like the 'referred pain' from having a collapsed lung. or it even felt like rib trauma (like having someone jam a needle into one of your ribs)  i guess now i think of it...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few hours later, quite out of the blue.. it stopped.  I'm sitting here now, and it's barely noticable and only on ocassion when i breathe in deeply -- which i obviously try not to do lol.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow... Here's the 'crazy' part. I'm in the Uk, our healthcare is free... Technically i have no reason not to go to the doctors / ER.   But, i'm desperate not to waste peoples time, i'm not sure if this is real and i'll freely admit i have a somewhat archaic view on mental health: \n\nSo to clarify, ever since the operation 10 years ago everytime i pull a muscle in my back or get any sorts of chest pains... My immediate first thought is \"my lung has collapsed\".  I understand that's kind of crazy, but at the same time it doesn't seem too unjustified since it collapsed in the first place for no apparent reason.  \n\nAt first i genuinely thought what i've said above, but as time has gone on i've come to realise that sometimes it really just is a pulled muscle in my back or whatever.. The problem is i think sometimes my mind is able to actually contribute to the 'symptoms'.\n\nMy memory is pretty bad but here's an example, it's late.. i'm working on the computer and suddenly i feel a tightness/pain in my chest.. sore rib... I mean any sort of pain in my chest area could 'set me off' i guess...  Within 15 minutes the pain will be so much increased and eventualy i will have to go lie down... If i don't lie down, i will black-out.\n\nUsually i'd describe an associated sound of 'rushing water' but maybe  that's a bad explanation... it sounds like i'm underwater... everything is muffled and bassy.\n\nOne time, a few months ago, i was sick and puked up a tiny amount of water...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt's the strangest thing to try to explain this to people because whilst i say that i think - i am the cause of the symptoms... Knowing this at the time doesn't help mitigate them.\n\nIt's like a fear of heights i guess,  knowing i'm scared of the height... even being in a fairly safe environment, doesn't help?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn some level  I view my mental issues regarding this illness as weakness.  Yes, i realise that's stupid. It doesn't change my view or help me 'cope' with the associated self-loathing.  I am not happy to take medication that will attempt to change my personality or anything like that and if i'm completely honest i'm somewhat skeptical of the idea of counselling (although i do admit, i would consider going to see someone if it wasn't going to be a waste of their and my time -- fuck it, just their time.. because i've got the time but i'm sure there are people out there with much more serious issues).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, this is one incident but this is kind of how my mind has worked for the last 10 years...  I mean, one collapsed lung was done in my sleep.. the other i sneezed... I wasn't exactly fighting Lions/Tigers in the arena or anything.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThese days at the first sign of any pain in my chest area i'm immediately on edge and start to be very guarded with how i move and breath...  I can't believe i'm going to say this but I think i'm also capable of creating symptoms and pains myself ... But since at the time these things are happening i'm trying to self diagnose it's hard to self-diagnose if you are creating phantom pains yourself...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't even know what i want from this post..   \nI'm unlikely to want to take any medication that's serving the purpose of affecting my state of mind, because i'm not happy to have my personality changed -- at the same time i do realise that's probably the only 'solution' long term.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou know what, i can't be bothered to edit this anymore -- i'm just gonna put this out there instead of deleting it and closing it...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI guess really, my question would be, if i had a single question... Is it worth me asking my GP for some sort of counselling, and could that accomplish anything?\n\nalso How crazy am i ?  :)",

        "My father is 76 years old.  At the end of March of this year, he had his right hip replaced.  About two weeks after being released from the hospital, the hip dislocated while he was in the shower.  He had to crawl to the phone and dial 911 to be rushed to the emergency room.  The ER physicians popped the hip back into place and released him.\n\nOver the next few weeks this happened twice more.  After the second dislocation, he spent a week in physical rehab.  The third dislocation occurred about one to two weeks later (while he was simply sitting down), at which point he remained in the hospital until a revision surgery was performed by the same orthopedic surgeon.  This revision surgery occurred in the third week of May.\n\nHe spent the next several weeks healing.  I stayed with him to provide care for the first three weeks after his release.  He followed all precautionary protocols as he was advised to do so for the following three months.  More than three months from the time of his revision surgery (yesterday), the hip dislocated again while in the shower.\n\nFrom what I've read online, this should be very rare.  I am curious what the potential causes for such frequent dislocation could be, especially after the precautionary three month period following the revision surgery.  Could malpractice be a likely cause?  What are the best causes of action for a patient in such a situation going forward?\n\nEdit: To provide more details, he is also about 5'8\" and \\~180-190 lbs.",

        "So, for the past... I'd say about 2 months now, I've been having pain in the entire left side of my head. It comes and goes at random and can last for a couple minutes to a couple days. I am currently 16 years old, however the pain started when I was 15(I had a birthday last month). Anyway, it started around the middle of June, so I just decided that it was stress since Finals were coming up(Quite frankly, I was.). However, after school ended and I got my marks back (All of which were more than I could have wanted, so I wasn't worried about the results anymore. However, the pain still kept coming back. About a month ago, I went to my family doctor about it, however she said that nothing could be done until I get an MRI(I believe she said MRI, I'm not 100% sure), however since I live in a rural province in Canada, there is only one MRI machine in my area and since my parents don't own a car, we can't exactly go very far from my hometown. So, because of all of this, I can't have it done until December. The 23rd I believe.\n\nIt also started originally in my left lower jaw. But I could feel the pain going from my jaw to my ear, then my ear to the top left side of my head, back down to my jaw, and it moved almost in a circle, sometimes switching direction. Now it's just all three of them hurting at once.\n\nI'm very sorry if this was wordy, or if it doesn't really make much sense(Or maybe it does, I don't know if I worded it well enough.).

I\u2019ve been to my primary doctor and a rheumatologist. the primary doctor said I tested positive for an autoimmune disorder and strep (and he gave me antibiotics for the strep which I finished) and I am still waiting for the rheumatologist results. The rheumatologist said they don\u2019t think anything is wrong with me, which is fine for me to accept, but at the same time I have this constant never ending pain and also never ending need to crack my back/neck/fingers and I have no relief from it. I also get really awful sharp pains in my jaw on occasion and really bad headaches too which may be related. Another thing too is I\u2019m able to crack my joints literally every minute, there\u2019s almost no recharge. I could crack all my joints and then wait a minute and crack them all again so maybe there\u2019s some kind of fluid buildup issue?

They also told me that I needed to schedule another appointment for another blood test, to ensure that there wasn\u2019t a mistake.\n\nTwo months or so before this I visited an urgent care with some vaginal discomfort (I thought it was a yeast infection) where they told me that my urine test indicated that I had a UTI and might be pregnant (even when I had already had three periods since the last time I had unprotected sex with my bf). They wanted me to do a blood test that day to confirm the pregnancy result, but I was in a rush and refused. They treated me for the UTI and needless to say, I ended up not being pregnant.\n\nA week after this visit, they called me back and told me that I had Chlamydia. They quickly treated me for this. I told my boyfriend, he went to get tested for STDs, and also ended up having Chlamydia (but nothing else)\n\nI am hoping that my low white blood cell count is a product of having Chlamydia that I didn\u2019t know about. But, honestly, this whole situation is just stressing me out. Why do I need to take another blood test? Why can\u2019t you just tell me what\u2019s wrong with my body from one appointment? All these \u201cyou COULD be\u201d \u201cyou MIGHT have\u201d. Why don\u2019t you know? This is your job.\n\nNow, I\u2019m really just anxious. Every time I get a call from the doctor\u2019s I panic. All they\u2019ve had for me these last few months is bad news and uncertainties. It\u2019s frustrating. Lately, my body has been feeling off, and I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s because of the stress/ anxiety that the doctor\u2019s keep piling onto me, or if something truly is wrong with me &amp; they can\u2019t figure it out. \n\nI\u2019ll list out some of the symptoms I still have even after treatment for Chlamydia + UTI:\n\nAbdominal pain (sometimes sharp)\nExtreme fatigue\nDiarrhea \nHacking up phlegm (with no cough)\nAnxiety\nPoor appetite (I\u2019ve never eaten that much in general)\nSlight discomfort when I urinate (like I don\u2019t get all of it out)\nGet cold easily\nVaginal discharge (smelly)\n\nIf you have any answers for me I\u2019d really appreciate it.",

        "(19/F/5\u20194/127 lbs) About a week ago my psychiatrist decided to take me off Paxil for a month (I\u2019ve been on it about 8 months) to see if I should try something else. Psych didn\u2019t give me any specific directions about weaning myself off of it, so I figured I\u2019d be alright trying to quit cold turkey. Now, a few days after stopping, I\u2019ve been feeling lightheaded for almost 3 days straight, from the time I wake up to the time I go to bed. I\u2019m not the best at describing these things, but it sort of feels like my brain\u2019s moving around in my head and if I walk/turn around I\u2019m going to fall over. So yeah, it\u2019s been a bit scary. I do get lightheaded from time to time, so it\u2019s nothing new, but usually it only lasts a few minutes. The fact that my head hasn\u2019t felt right in almost 4 days is kind of starting to get to me. Anywho, sorry for the long post. I guess my question is, is lightheadedness like this normal with SSRI withdrawal? Do I need to start taking the Paxil again and wean myself off properly? Or could it be something completely different?\nThanks in advance!",

        "Hello!\n\nFemale - 20 yrs old - 4\u201d11 (150 cm) - 133 lbs (~60 kg) \n\nSo I have been experiencing headaches for such a long time now, I don\u2019t have an exact point of reference for how long they\u2019ve been happening but I\u2019d guess about a year now. Randomly, I will get a headache that is so irritable that I cannot focus on anything that i\u2019m doing.\n\nThe headaches are always centered around my eyes, and many times affect my forehead and temple areas. But they hurt the most behind my eyes. Every time I try and explain it to someone I say it\u2019s as if someone were trying to push my eyes out from the inside. It\u2019s unbearable pressure behind my eyes and in the general areas surrounding them. \n\nI\u2019ve tried to document when they happen but there really isn\u2019t any noticeable pattern. I get them when i\u2019m at home, on my computer, out with people, at the mall, at school, at work, etc. the only noticeable thing I\u2019ve seen is that it almost always occurs when i\u2019m in a heavy populated area or anywhere with a lot of visual input.\n\nIncase this is important information i\u2019m studying animation so i am Always on a computer. And I have 20/20 vision. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s necessary information but a lot of people try telling me it\u2019s my vision. it isn\u2019t. \n\nI HAVE gone to my general physician about this more than once but all he\u2019s ever done was brush me aside and prescribe me ibuprofen. They don\u2019t work. Even now as I type my headache has formed \ufffd\ufffd. Can anyone give me any advice as to what this may be? How can I try to remedy it or even what kind of doctor I should go to?? Please help these headaches have been plaguing me for too long.",

        "I'm 22, 6ft4 &amp; idk about my weight, male, not a smoker\n\nStarted  taking something called risperidal/risperidon 4 weeks ago. I have  anxiety and intrusive thoughts, so i agreed to be put on it to see if it  helped. I noticed some side effects right away such as having a less  refreshing sleep. That was on 1mg dose. I have since gotten 2 mg and 3 mg respectively, and i could feel my sleep quality getting worse as my  dose rose. I've had trouble sleeping for weeks but the last week it's significantly worsened, and just as i rose from 2 mg to 3, too. I can't sleep at all now, it's like i've lost the ability to fall asleep completely. I'm so tired and feel like i'm about to pass out but yet when i lie down i can't fall asleep.\n\nThe  problem is the clinician who assigned me this dose isn't communicating  with me. I have complained about the sleep thing on several occations  but it's as if i get brushed off and treated as someone who is just  paranoid or imagining things They simply said that that was not a  common side effect of the drug, even though it says so on the  description for the medication. I could deal with less restorative  sleep, but right now i'm not sleeping at all.  I am really worried about  how long i can go on like this and i don't know who to go to or how to communicate my problem. I guess i am very afraid",

He said he had diarrhea and vomiting the following day and was not doing well the entire trip (1 week). He returned back to India and went to a doctor and the doctor said he was perfectly ok and he might have some digestion issues. Since then it has been 2 months and he is still not ok. He has lost about 12lbs in weight and had severe headaches and feels tired all the time. He has diarrhea every couple of days. Also since yesterday, he is experiencing pain around his rectum. My dad said he was also crying last night and it makes me very sad. He has been 4 doctors so far and all they say is there is nothing wrong with him and it will take time to be normal again. I'm looking for suggestions as to what our next steps should be. I'm really worried. He was a really healthy guy and never had any major issues before.

I take motrin (roughly 600mgs) almost daily, when needed and use medicinal cannabis.   \n\n\nSo, some sort of what I can only guess to be uterine tissue(?) came out of me while I was on the toilet pushing out a number 2. I know it was not part of my number 2 for one thing because I felt it exiting and secondly it was err, separate from my stool. It was the size of my thumb nail (roughly a nickel). Normally I'd chalk it up to a blood clot (it looked like a fresh pink (\"whiter\" at the tips) tissue sample), except...I'm not on my cycle. I'm not at all bleeding/spotting. I ovulated \\*last week\\*, for which I did spot (about an hour). Furthermore, I never had a history of blood clots during my periods \\*until\\* recently (no lifestyle or dietary changes / stress changes etc) -- the last two periods I've had for me, abnormal clots because I've passed clots (period) which again, never did before (and NOT during heavy bleeding...at all). Now this bloodless tissue sample.  \nPossibly relevant -- I've been suspected of having Thoracic Endometriosis due to (3 confirmed) catamenial pneumothorax (already had VATS Pleurodesis w/ wedge resection; biopsy found nothing). Just want to make sure I'm not missing warning signs of something because google doesn't know what to make of random tissue samples exiting not-bleeding lady parts (I don't either) and I really don't want to go to the gyno if it's not something that'll ultimately kill me (I have mouths to feed so I can't just run in for every oddity).

Dont smoke, no meds and diagnosed with asthma.\n\nDec. of last year, I was in a fight where i got hit pretty hard in my right eye. A few days later I got hit from behind in the same eye (he threw a hook that connected to the side near my temple/eye area).\n\nI noticed on my camera roll before the fight, id always take selfies from the left side, and i often didnt even bother with wearing my glasses.\n\nThen I noticed that i took a pic of my eye right after it happened and i took it from the right, and starting favoring the right side. I also started wearing my glasses.\n\nFrom straight ahead before. my eyes both looked evenly. Now my right eye veers off and away slightly. I feel like i cant look left without turning my head.\n\nAlso, my left eye seems \"dead\". Like its just not really focused on the camera.\n\nI could be imagining all of this, but I still have loss of vision on the inner half of my left eye, and in photos it now looks like im making up for that by constantly turning my head slighty left while gazing slightly right.\n\nIs this possible? I didnt even notice the vision loss until 3 months later when I closed my right eye and honestly, I've hust put 2 and 2 together recently.\n\nIve been to retina specialsts and opthamologist, actually 2 of each. They cant find anything. BUT I did NOT TELL THEM ABOUT THE FIGHT, so im hoping a physician here can help knowing said new information.\n\nNow, the reason i think it may be brain damage is that I failed out of college last semster, always been a B student with the occasional C.\n\nI started drinking heavily, never been a drinker.\n\nI have trouble thinking now, can't concentrate. Extreme depression, generalized anxiety, panic attacks depersonalization and paranoia (never had a mental disorder aside from anxiety, and it wasnt all that bad). At first I thought I was going crazy, but after looking at some pics of my eyes (with dates) and thinking about the events that took place, and all the mental distress ive been under since, its not far fetched that I could of went partially blind from being hit is it?\n\nalso find it weird i got hit the hardest on my right eye and my left ones having issues. it wasnt even black",

At first I thought it might just have been indigestion but I'm not really sure now. It started as the normal slightly painful/burning sensation I get when I get reflux but it's been going on nonstop for five days. The type of pain and feeling changes too. Sometimes it feels like cramps, other times like a sharp object, other times like a sort of warm/burning pressure. It changes every once in a while and it's been going on all around my stomach, never in just a specific place. It feels like it's vibrating too sometimes. The pain goes back and forth from annoying, to more than just a mild pain. \nIt's accompanied by gas, bloating, and a constant feeling of needing to go to the bathroom. I have been drinking ginger tea with probiotics for the last four days because I heard it helps with digestion. My stool is softer and darker in color, and more constant, but I don't know if that's because of the tea. \nIt hurts a little when I press in the center part of my stomach above the bellybutton, but mostly my whole core just feels sensitive. It gets a little worse when I eat, and better after going to the bathroom. \nI don't have any nausea or diarrhea, and I've been trying to eat better and drink more water since it all started. \nIt doesn't help that I got my period just two days ago and it's hard to distinguish between the period cramps and whatever the hell is also happening besides that.\nWhat's happening??

Not daily.\nDiabetes: been tested off and on since 2010.  Was told I was very close to prediabetic but never crossed the threshold out of normal numbers.\nED/Premature: six months.\n\n\nDiabetes question:\nI had previously been told either I needed to lose weight or I\u2019d probably end up as a diabetic by my former family doc. No doctor former or present had been able to see anything sketchy during fast blood tests.In May 2014 I weighed 263. I was having problems with what I assume is blood sugar.  Cold sweats, inability to focus, feeling like my head was moving when it wasn\u2019t and the only thing that solved it was food.  In September of 2014 I had dropped to 187.  I had began working out every day for upwards of an hour and eating food besides pizza.  I still get these cold sweats and dizziness/lightheaded now that I\u2019m in better shape.  I\u2019ve been tested for diabetes two times since then and everything was okay.  I\u2019m unsure how to proceed however I know somethings wrong and I\u2019m scared now that I\u2019ll get dizzy unexpectedly and won\u2019t be able to care for my infant daughter.  This appears to be common for diabetes, but I\u2019m unsure of how to proceed.\n\nEmotional:\nI had a job that required overnights that I wasn\u2019t aware of.  It was a month solid of 2-4 hours of sleep per night and living off caffeine.  During this time I developed an inability to stop crying in normal situations.\n\nI cried during a job interview when I told them I was grateful for the opportunity to talk to him.\n\nI cried when I told my partner I loved her or hugged her.\n\nThat was four years ago.  I still cry over stuff that I don\u2019t really care that much about and I don\u2019t feel sad.\n\nI haven\u2019t really known where to look into this or how.  I don\u2019t believe therapy is the issue because there\u2019s nothing I feel that\u2019s emotionally wrong and I\u2019m pretty open about if something is messed up.\n\nThis led me to question if it was a hormone issue?  Testosterone maybe?  The emotional stuff coupled with the additional sexual stuff below has really made me wonder what\u2019s occurring.  I could handle the crying because I knew there wasn\u2019t anything wrong, however...\n\n\nNot to toot my own horn but from 2015-2017 I was pretty good in bed...  there was a reduction in sex towards the end of 2017 due to my partner having a more stressful job.  A lack of \u201cpractice\u201dmay be a contributing factor to premature.\n\nI\u2019ve been recently (6 months) been having some issues in the sexual department.  I am able to get an erection however it doesn\u2019t go fully hard. Maybe 85% of the way.  With this inability to get fully hard there is an extreme increase in sensitivity in the head of my penis to the point where I can finish in sub 30 seconds of just being touched.  \n\nI\u2019m unsure where I could proceed medically.  I still exercise frequently (2-3 times a week, down from 6-7 a week tho).  I still find the woman I\u2019m with to be unbelievably attractive and still have the desire and lust for her like I did on day 1.\n\nIs there anything I could mention to my doctor to get a ball rolling?  I\u2019m currently looking for a new GP as I just relocated...  My concern is that I have low T or some other hormone but Google only me so much to work off of.",

        "The problem started in late 2016 when I had been rigorously working out for 2 months without taking enough calories and hadn't been in the sun much for the past 7-8 months. Prior to the work out regime I had lost 10 kilos in like 4 months. I started feeling weak but I attributed it to being extremely depressed for a very long time. It was only in March of 2017 that I got a blood test done which revealed that I had an immunoassay of 19 which was extremely low as the lowest acceptable point on that scale is 75.\n\nI took the meds for 2 months and didn't think the meds were needed any further. I soon after that started feeling weak and falling ill very often. I spent almost the entirety of 2017 like this.\n\nThen I got a blood test done in 2018 which revealed that my immunoassay was still extremely low. I started taking the meds and took them for 6-7 months regularly. But in September of 2018 I fell ill again and started feeling very weak. Then my immunity started worsening again as it had in 2017 and 2018 until I picked up the meds again.\n\nNow in 2019 I've been relatively well but since yesterday I've experienced this sharp intermittent pain in my right foot at least 4 times. I used to experience this pain in 2016 around the time my Vitamin D deficiency symptoms started showing but it was never at such regular intervals. Do I have arthiritis?

I\u2019ve had anxiety to some extent for pretty much most of life, and I started having panic attacks sometime this summer and was finally formally diagnosed GAD as well as panic disorder.

Despite the fact that about a month and a half ago my doctor told me my heart was in good shape and I had great blood pressure, I\u2019m still worried. Part of this worry comes from the fact that in rare cases, Lexapro can apparently cause irregular heart rhythms. Sometimes when I get anxious, I\u2019ll get chest pains that are generally localized in certain areas. I know this is probably anxiety, but it\u2019s still scares the hell out of me and makes me more anxious in turn. I also noticed that my resting heart rate is 53-63, which I know is slightly below the threshold of normal for athletes. Is all this normal?",

No sure of medications besides thorazine now.\n\n\n\nI have read every comment and message but to be honest it's still been a bit raw to process everything emotionally.\n\n\nWhen I left you guys off, i left at my brother was at the psych ward being evaluated. I spoke with his doctor and nurse 1on1 to discuss my own opinion that the condition was underlying. I also gave an in depth paper that I wrote together with him about all of his symptoms whether he was using or clean when the symptom presented. I gave him a safe word for if he felt uncomfortable for the nurse to give to me immediately so I could discuss with them how to calm him down (i wasnt allowed back with him) and I wait until he was released. About 7 hours later he was released diagnosed after a 10 min session with meth psychosis. He was then discharged with advice to go to rehab. I knew this was wtong because from the literal second I mentioned meth to the doctor (pre eval) he said it was meth psychosis.\n\n\nSince then he has bounced between staying with my mom, being in in patient, and relapsing. \n\n\n\nYesterday he finished a separate short stay for mental eval and he was FINALLY diagnosed schizophrenic. The doctor didn't know how he had never been diagnosed before because it was blatantly obvious. They wanted him to stay but he didnt like it there. He was put on thorazine. He relasped immediately after my grandma gave him 40$ to see a chiropractor because he said his neck is killing him, he is dizzy and couldn't think straight. An ambulance had to be called when he was found passing out randomly and stumbling in the street.\n\n\nToday he left to go to a 60 day program for mental health in another city nearby. We have decided as a family that if he is kicked out or leaves by choice before 60 days is over, we will need to get states permission for him to be involuntarily committed. It's horrible but if he is to ever stay alive (in general) and live a semi normal life, he needs an extended stay to get him under control. We didn't tell him this because we don't want him to feel paranoid or pressured. If you feel any of these decisions are wrong please don't feel afraid to tell me how I should do it differently. I love him and just want the best for him.\n\n\nSo now we wait. I just wanted to give everyone who gave great advice an update and to say thank you. Now it is one day at a time until he is himself again. I will give an update much later on if anyone wants to know how true mental treatment works for him. Thanks again!",

Well, this summer it feels like I have lost all of my friends. Nothing interests me to much anymore, I used to love the outdoors. I am always feeling tired/fatigued, very low motivation, nervousness/anxiety, have always had diarrhea regularly for the past 3-4 years (not sure if thats needed) and a great feeling of brain fog, almost numb and forgetful. Especially when speaking to people, almost as if I'm in third person and it takes me a good few seconds to register what people say. I'm only a junior and its crazy, its like I'm losing all hope and do not feel comfortable at all talking to people, I talk to my parents but I don't even hug them anymore. The thing is, I went into my doctor and talked about these problems, we did immediate bloodwork and it looked like my kidneys were a bit damaged, (not super important) by higher amounts of chemicals, I forgot the name. But my blood sugar was at 59, before I went to the doctor (1-1/2 hours) I had two peanut butter sandwiches and a glass of orange juice. Any idea why my blood sugar was so low? The part that makes me hopeless is I purchased a tester kit and tested it 4 days after the doc appointment and it read around 93, and around 113 after I ate food. I'm stumped, I still feel horrible and I lost my lead that gave me hope. Anything, I mean any ideas would be amazing, I just feel like this is a physical problem, not a mental problem, maybe its just giving me symptoms of depression.",

I bring up the darkened spot and he looks around in my eye and says he doesn't see any problems. Soon after I got my glasses, I had my first ocular migraine, and the temporary vision loss associated with it was in my left eye. Over the next 10ish months, I noticed that if I squinted, I could see small lines in my vision. I thought nothing of it at first, but it kept getting worse and worse until now, where I can see that they seem to be veins and random groups of straight lines by barely squinting. I went to a different eye doctor so that I could have an appointment dedicated to figuring this out. At the end of the appointment, he basically said something along the lines of \"sometimes your brain just plays tricks\", which I immediately thought wasn't my problem, because it just sounded ridiculous. I'd really like to figure out what exactly is wrong with me and am hoping that you guys can help me.",

        "So here is something that happens to me too often:\n\nI masturbate, when this happens it's more often (but not always) right before bed\n\nAfter finishing, a burning sensation will start appearing at my urethra. This sensation is accompanied by a strong urge to pee. Even after peeing, the urge remains.\n\nIf this happens I usually get in the shower, as it makes the burning not as bad and I can pee whenever I feel the need to. Both sensations are uncomfortable to the point that I can't stand not being in the shower\n\nAfter 30-60 minutes in the shower it goes away, with me very annoyed that I lost 30-60 minutes of sleep.\n\nFrom researching I think this may be prostatitis, specifically chronic nonbacterial.

However, on the rare occasion I do do it more than once in a day, it's almost guaranteed the sensation will happen.\n\nOn a normal day, the likelihood varies. I've gone a couple months without it happening once, but in the past week it's happened every time I've done it. On average, there's maybe a 30% chance it will happen",

        "I'm recently 30, I'm female, and I've been fighting with my Dr's office to get proper care for over 5 years. \n\nI had to switch GP's due to a change in insurance \\~6 years ago.  My previous Dr. was an older gentleman who has a family practice, He always listened to my concerns, Answered my questions himself, and would suggest multiple appropriate solutions to my problems (taking into account my preferences) for which one he said we should try first. \n\n**My \"new\" Dr. will not listen to me!** \n\nWhen I went to my \"old\" GP asking for BC to skip periods (because they were heavy and painful) and control severe acne he put me on a Seasonale equivalent, I was on the same medication/dose from age 18 to 25, with no breaks and no negative side effects. I had just been to my yearly pap and had gotten a new script about 3 weeks before my insurance changed, The insurance company did not tell me that any old prescriptions would need to be renewed through a new Dr in their network in order for them to cover it (I had switched insurance before but had been able to keep my Dr.) until I went to pick up my next pack and the pharmacy told me insurance had denied it for being an old script. \n\nSo I made an appointment to visit this Dr., I explained that my BC script had \"expired\" the insurance would not pay for it because it was old and I needed a new one, I brought the packaging of the old medication with me so that she could write me the script for the same kind.   She said I didn't need to be taking that brand/kind/type because it was used to skip periods (Seasonale equivalent) and when I said \"That's what I use it for, skipping periods and preventing acne. I'm not using it to prevent pregnancy.\"  she looked me straight in the eye and said, \"well then why are you taking it?\" WTF? I literally just said I'm taking it to skip periods???  So I said \"I use it to skip my periods and prevent acne.\" she shook her head and stared at me for a minute and then just said \"No.\" and that was only the first time I was refused care for something.  \n\nShe has suggested multiple times that my chronic back pain/issues I have had since I was 11 years old are because I am overweight when I was never overweight until after she refused to write a new script for the BC and I was forced to stop taking it. \n\nI went back 2 or 3 months later saying that my periods are now excessively heavy and excruciatingly painful (I often have to call into work because I can't get out of bed) and she still refused to write me the script. I have gone back at least 8 times in 5 years and I've been refused the medication every single time.  I even told her that the amount of stuff (tampons, pads, pain killers, new clothes when the old ones get ruined, etc.) I have to buy to control/prepare for/deal with my period is putting a burden on my finances and she actually suggested I look for a different job? Am I wrong or is that completely unprofessional? \n\nI've tried to switch Dr's but my insurance only works with a few offices in my area (they are somehow all operated by this same Dr?) and absolutely NO gynecologists in my area accept the insurance I have.  The office itself won't let me switch Dr's even after I have asked multiple times; expressing my concerns to them that I am not getting the care that I need, and that I'm not satisfied with the services that this Dr. is providing.  I've also done some research (recently and accidentally) and this Dr. is accepting huge amounts of money from drug companies that mostly deal with diabetes medications.\n\nI'm so frustrated, I don't know what to do. My mental health is suffering; my depression has gotten worse (I want to die now), I've become more anxious (I started biting my nails/the skin around them and I have tried to stop but I can't), and every time I mention this to my Dr she just dismisses my concerns and problems. \n\n**TLDR: My \"New\" Dr. refused to give me a script for birth control because I use it to skip periods instead of preventing pregnancy and now I want to die.**",

My legs will also get really weak.  The pain doesn\u2019t last too long as long I lay down it will go away.  My legs get really weak and I\u2019ll have trouble walking.

I'm 5'7, 130-140 lbs.\n\nMy **question** (bolded for ease of finding) is **what should I do next? Who should I see next? Are my doctors just telling me to give up?**\n\nSince last October or so, I've had - a bevy of doctors bounce me back and forth. I went in for something still untreated, flashing lights and images that make it pretty much impossible to sleep. Doctors have suggested sinusitis, asthma, heartburn, gerd, stress... \n\nAnd I have tried varying courses of antiobiotics, prednisone, ppis, pretty much whatever they suggest, and nothing helps. I've got a pretty broad range of symptoms - but listing them all would make this long, and just lose any chance of help I might actually get. Outside of what I mentioned above, I've had pretty awful pressure in my head/sinuses, throatburn. Seen an ENT several times, ultimately did a septoplasty, which...\n\nNot only was it not nearly as bad as everyone pretended it was gonna be, I don't think it did much - well, besides cost a nostril and a leg.\n\nGot endscoped, came back clear, and I don't feel as if gerd is on the ball (for what it's worth, it seems like the GI is in agreement; I'm off PPIs/Ranitidine/etc, and it hasn't really benefited or hurt me). \n\nFor one - and maybe it's just that there's apparently zero research done on gerd, but I hope that's not the case! - NONE of the common advice and NONE of the 'don't do these' has any effect on me at all. I can remove all spicy food and caffeine and chocolate from my diet, sleep only on the left side, with an elevated headrest and... Get nothing. And I already exercise daily, stay hydrated...\n\nAnd flipping that around, I've had days where I eat plenty of spicy food/drink plenty of coffee, and it doesn't seem to have any effect at all. So, it's really made it hard to have confidence in my medical professionals - and I can't afford to keep being seen to have people go 'uh-huh, well, we just don't know.'\n\nAt the moment, I dread sleeping and I dread waking. Lately, my mouth feels like it's locking up; it's constantly dry and 'sucking' inwards, and nobody (dentist/oral medical specialist) can seem to figure out why. Like every other condition, it doesn't seem to be dangerous, but - I'm just constantly miserable. Haha.\n\nPlease help.\n\nedited and thank you, so much!",

        "Male, 26.  \n6' 2\", 190lbs  \nDuration: ~6 months  \nLocation: Chest  \nMedical history: Tachycardia.  \nLifestyle: Very active  \nMedications: Temazepam (if needed), atenolol\n\nTo make a long story short, I began seeing a cardiologist in 2014 for tachycardia. Several EKGs, a 24 hour holter monitor, and an echo all came back normal. My doctor diagnosed me with inappropriate sinus tachycardia and put me on atenolol. That fixed it until about January of this year, when I began experiencing bradycardia. My cardiologist said that my tachycardia had gone away, perhaps temporarily, and that tapering off the atenolol would resolve the bradycardia, which it did. In the months that followed however, I developed several symptoms that I hadn't had before:\n\n  \n\n1. My heart beats very forcefully, especially at night. This doesn't seem to be a palpitation, as it lasts hours. The beating is strong enough to shake me in bed, and is rather uncomfortable. Yet when I wake up, my heart beat is perfectly subtle.\n\n  \n\n2. The heart beat itself has an odd quality to it. If I were to compare a normal beat to someone beating a drum, this forceful beat is more like someone sloshing a bottle of water back and forth; it feels prolonged. I have had a couple of EKGs while experiencing this, and they both came back normal. My cardiologist says it's nothing to worry about it.\n\n  \n\n3. An increase in palpitations; several every night.\n\n  \n\n4. Muscle twitches in my limbs. They twitch all day and night, but are a bit unusual in that the twitching is very fast and subtle; more like a vibration than the occasional twitch I might have after the gym. \n\n  \n\nA couple of days ago, I was a bit tachy, so I took one of the leftover atenolol tablets. About an hour later, all of the above was resolved for the first time since it began. My heart beat is as subtle as it is in the morning, the beat itself feels perfectly normal, and my twitches are almost nonexistent now. For months now these symptoms have made evenings pretty depressing, with a constant vague feeling that I was on the verge of expiring. But now, everything is fine, I feel like a new man. And yet, all of those tests came back fine, and my cardiologist said not to worry. What might it be, and how serious does it sound? Thank you for your time.",

        "24 Year old male, 5'6 165 pounds. \n\nTo get to the point...I completely stopped being able to feel hunger over the course of a few years. I first noticed I would be exceptionally hungry after work outs, but completely lacking in appetite (ie my stomach was growling and I felt in need of food, but nothing sounded appealing). I noticed this in 2016. As the years progressed, and around 2017, is when I began to realize I don\u2019t feel hungry ever. I enjoy bodybuilding so I have had a habit of forcing myself to eat no matter how difficult. It gets to the point where my throat automatically closes and I gag when I try to eat, but I do it anyways.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI can go an entire day without eating anything, but force myself not to because I\u2019m in school and work part time. To give you an idea, I basically sit for over an hour choking down food and usually have the urge to vomit (not nausea, but a gag reflex). I saw a doctor last year and he diagnosed me with anorexia, however I\u2019m a 5\u20196 male weighing 165 pounds so I doubt any eating disorder therapist will help me.\n\nThe doctor I saw recommended I see a psychiatrist, so I went, ended up on prozac for 6 months, it helped SLIGHTLY but I still had no desire for food, it was merely easier to choke food down, but I got off the medication because I didn\u2019t like how it made me feel. Prior to all this I did a blood lab and urinalysis, he said everything was normal (including testosterone) EXCEPT vitamin D.\n\nI feel trapped. People seem to not understand what I\u2019m going through because, unfortunately in America, people are obsessed with weight loss and envy my suffering. At least once a week I'm extremely fatigued, suffer from headaches, can't focus in school or even carry a basic conversation because of how deprived of energy I feel.\n\nI feel like my only option is to starve myself to the point of hospitalization, so that medical professionals can actually feel inclined to help me, as ridiculous as that sounds. I know it would be too easy, too because it\u2019s as if my body is hardwired to AVOID eating. I've called eating disorder centers, and most of them don't take my insurance. I'm going to look for doctors again, but hardly any are accepting new patients in my area. As I type this, I have a pounding headache and feel extremely weak as recently I\u2019ve been slowly giving up on trying to eat. I have no where to turn to and this is taking a serious toll on my life, as ridiculous at it might seem.",

        "I'm 24, transgender male (assigned female at birth, no medical transition steps, yet). I am overweight, but not sure if it makes a difference here. I have sarcoma (stage 4, only spread to lungs). I had a large scale tumor resection almost two years ago. It was an internal hemipelvectomy. No \"equipment\" was put in aside from a staple (that I believe is to attach the remaining nerve to the sacrum based on radiology reports but I'm not 100% sure as my surgeons never mentioned it), I may be developing arthritis in that hip now, though. I had radiation to the area prior to surgery. They started with the abdomen, freed the tumor from the inside (Nothing else was done on the front) and then pulled it through the sciatic notch to remove it. The cancer had completely invaded and encapsulated my sciatic nerve and several muscles, possibly other nerves as well. I know had two of the \"gluteus\" muscles removed but I can't remember which two. They also removed \"nearly a foot\" of the sciatic nerve but I don't know if my surgeon was exaggerating or not. I have a scar from the top of my buttock down to the side of my leg, about midway down my thigh. I have no feeling down a lot of my leg now (and no ability to control the muscles at my ankle, so severe foot drop). Aside from chemo medications I am on meds for pain (I don't feel comfortable disclosing the exact medications but can PM if you think it's relevant), thyroid medication, and nausea medication. I have been on all of the medications except for the chemotherapy consistently since I was diagnosed, but the doses have changed over time.   \n\n\nAfter the surgery, initially, my leg being cold would increase my nerve pain. I guess it eventually stopped causing the pain to get worse, though. A few weeks ago I noticed that my leg gets FREEZING cold at night, still, and it's starting to cause pain issues to get worse again. I have been having more swelling and fluid issues since I restarted chemotherapy (Votrient) and I am currently waiting for referral to lymphedema clinic to go through. I'm just wondering if anyone has thoughts on why it's like this? Or any tips on what I can do until I see the lymphedema clinic and start getting things sorted out. It literally feels like I have dunked my leg in ice water and left it there or something. I am worried it may be poor blood flow in general, but I don't know for sure. I feel bad that I didn't notice it sooner. When I check my foot it's usually right before bed, and it usually takes it a while to get noticeably cold, so I guess that's why I missed it? It also definitely gets colder if I have a day where I am active and swell more than normal.",

        "Hello.\n\nI've been having this gnarly rash on my chest for quite a while now and it doesn't seem to want to go away. It has been around for about a month now. I've tried Alergosan ( chloropyramine hydrochloride ),  Jodasept cream (povidone-iodine), normal skin cream for general care, and Antimyco-beta (it doesn't seem to be a fungal infection, or an alergic reaction).\n\nHere are some photos, but keep in mind they are nsfw and show the wounded skin of my chest:\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/JCEbbeR](https://imgur.com/a/JCEbbeR)\n\nThe orange tint is coming from Jodacept cream, which I applied before I went to sleep last night. It doesn't seem to have helped much, like the other things I've tried, except probably baby skin care cream - but the effect is quite small from that.\n\nThe rash looks even worse at the moment of the photos because when I shower and wash my chest, it gets re-wounded and it looks horrid. The problem is that it has been healing extremely slowly. I've gotten it previously in the past, but not to such a degree, and it usually doesn't stay this long.\n\nI'd like to at least ask what can I use to make it heal faster? And can you tell me why it even appears in the first place or what it is?\n\nSome additional info is that I've been losing a lot of weight after I started training and I dropped almost all sugary foods from my diet (vs before where I would eat a lot of sugar daily and led a very stale life without much exercise).\n\nAlso: age - 29, sex - male, height - 176cm, weight - 83kg, race - Caucasian, non-smoker.\n\nThanks to anyone for any help!",

        "I guess this kinda started a few years ago, I noticed that I wasn't getting a full erection during sex. At that point I didn't think anything of it, it was still ~90% of a full erection and didn't seem much different. The first time I couldn't maintain an erection firm enough for sex, I was on molly, which I thought was weird because normally molly has the opposite effect. It was my first (and last) time trying molly though, so I figured the drug just affected me differently. After that, things seemed to be normal. I should point out that I regularly get tested and the majority of women I've slept with have been on birth control. Kind of goes without saying what wasn't being used. Well, I hooked up with a girl that wasn't on birth control, and we used a condom. Then and ever since then, I haven't been able to maintain an erection in a condom. I figured it was just condoms, because without them I was fine and didn't normally use them. That brings us to the past month or so. About a month ago, I went to hook up with a girl after a solid 8 month dry spell. My sex drive has dropped off a cliff the past couple years, but it had been awhile and I was eager. We tried to use a condom, but same shit. Couldn't keep an erection. We took the condom off, and I could tell even after that I wasn't as hard as normal. I figured it was the thought of not wanting to risk pregnancy and the fact we were in a car. She gave me a blowjob after I decided to stop and I was fine. I was slightly worried, but again just brushed it off. Now just recently, I hooked up with one of my exes. We've stayed close over the years, and have hooked up a few times. I'm comfortable around her, and after a few drinks any nervousness was gone. She's on birth control, I was recently tested, so a condom wasn't even mentioned. I didn't think there'd be any problem at all. Wrong. Throughout foreplay, I could feel I had a decent erection, but nowhere near normal. I figured when we started having sex, there wouldn't be an issue. And there wasn't at first. But when we tried to change positions I just went soft and couldn't get it back up. We attributed it to the alcohol, and tried again a couple hours later. Same shit. We again blamed the alcohol, but I knew it probably wasn't the alcohol and that this has become a trend. I was terribly embarrassed and humiliated, my confidence has already been suffering, and this incident has made my confidence hit rock bottom. I can't get out of my own head about it and haven't hardly slept or eaten since. It's fucking me up. This is something I need to change, and figured people here may have good advice for me. I plan on seeing a doctor to make sure it's not a sign of a more serious issue, but until then I'm curious what you all have to say.\nThanks in advance.\n\nEdit: Just saw the rule regarding Height/Weight/Etc\nI'm a male, 22, 6' 175 lbs, Caucasian, Smoke marijuana and cigarettes, drink occasionally.",

Sometimes it comes in waves, other times it\u2019s just persistent and won\u2019t leave me alone. Even when the pain has gone, it feels like a tight rubber band is around my middle and my belly feels distended and swollen. Normally it\u2019s flat but this week it\u2019s been protruding and felt heavy.\n\nThe story: Monday morning I woke up with a stomach ache. It persisted all day and I had to go home from work. Tuesday I felt absolutely fine all day and figured Monday was just a blip. Wednesday it started up again in the afternoon after a coffee. I also discovered that it seemed to go away when I walked, exercised and ate. I\u2019ve  since stopped drinking coffee and Thursday and yesterday were mostly okay. But this morning I\u2019m in agony. The pain is sharper and more cramp like and comes in stronger waves. I haven\u2019t changed anything in my diet or routine other than to remove coffee. \n\nI have a doctor\u2019s appointment on Thursday 29th but it\u2019s really upsetting me and I don\u2019t know what to do in the meantime.

They prescribed steroids for inflammation of the lungs, and they gave her an oxygen tank to help her breathe. They had the house tested for fungus/molds and those all came back normal, and they removed any chemical agents of suspect. Still, her condition only worsened. There were days where she was too fatigued to get out of bed, and even with her oxygen tank she struggles to breathe.  She's now back in the hospital and her condition has become so dire that they've hooked her up to all sorts of breathing apparatuses, and have had to induce partial paralysis in order to mitigate the symptoms. The doctors are struggling to identify any root cause. She's currently on a list for a lung transplant, but it's not looking good. My posting here is a last-ditch attempt at obtaining other opinions on possible root causes.

        "Age: 25. Female. White. Medical history: glandular a few years ago, nothing else of much note. Medications: Diane 35. \n\nHey guys, \n\nSo I\u2019ve had some symptoms for about six months plus, and they are progressively getting worse. Extreme fatigue, to the point where I can\u2019t even get to class/can\u2019t stay awake when I do (yes, literally falling dead asleep in classrooms). I have periods of low grade fevers, mainly in the early hours of the morning/waking. These periods come and go (eg might have them for a month, then not, then again). I\u2019ve had an enlarged spleen (confirmed by a GP) which is also painful at times. I\u2019ve had a loss of appetite and often only have one meal a day, and often don\u2019t want food at all. As a consequence, I have lost some size but not a heap. Recently I\u2019ve had a mild barking cough every now and then for no discernible reason, and a tight chest. \n\nThen, three weeks ago, I found a lump on my neck. It came up literally over night. One day I didn\u2019t have it, the next I did. It\u2019s off the midline of my neck, to the left, in the \u2018anterior triangle\u2019. It\u2019s quite big (close to golf ball size, maybe ping pong ball or bigger). It feels completely solid, as solid as one of those rubber balls you play with as a kid, the hard ones. I can\u2019t move it around with my fingers. It doesn\u2019t move per say when I swallow or stick my tongue out, like, the lump is still in the same place, but it moves in the sense that it\u2019s attracted to its surroundings and its surroundings move (if that makes sense). It doesn\u2019t hurt, not tender. \n\nAnyway, I got an ultrasound today. The technician looked quite grave and said she wanted to show the doctor the images and see if he wanted to look himself. He did. He had a look and asked her \u2018is there any vascularity\u2019 and she said \u2018there\u2019s some just here\u2019 and pointed to the outside edge of the lump. It was big, like very obvious on the ultrasound, circle, black. \n\nThe radiologist told me I\u2019d likely be referred to an ENT and have a CT, surgery may be an option depending. He said it could be a cyst. \n\nNow, obviously there\u2019s more tests to be done. But I feel like my GP (and I suppose the radiologist, although he didn\u2019t ask me about symptoms and didn\u2019t have any information on my referral other than to scan the neck) aren\u2019t understanding that my symptoms OTHER than the lump are truly concerning me. The lump is getting bigger but it isn\u2019t impacting my life - I\u2019m so tired I literally can\u2019t quite function. \n\nI don\u2019t know whether the lump and symptoms are actually connected, but I want a solution. \n\nAlso how common is it for someone to suddenly have a Thyroglossal cyst issue, golf ball sized, over night and in their mid twenties? I\u2019ve never had a lump in my neck before. I also hadn\u2019t had a cold or flu except three months prior I had a week long cold. \n\nAny suggestions as to what could be going on and how much to push for a solution?",

And I was fine for a few days, until tonight when I went to sleep and laid down, flat on my back I immediately felt both testicles tighten, so I quickly stood up and inspected and it seemed like the cremaster muscle went haywire because my scrotum seemed completely flat, so i started panicking and placed my hand over it to give it some warmth and slowly they came back down and took their usual spots. When I attempted to lay down again I felt the exact same thing and this time it seemed like both of my testicles were stuck, bunched up in front, with the cremaster muscle kicking in. *There is no pain*, but I am worried that it means that some sort of blood flow is getting cut off if they go back down but aren't all the way in the scrotum.  Even though its very warm, the muscle is still taking effect. Is it something to do with the legs? Is laying down somehow activating a movement in my scrotum, which eventually leads to the cremaster coming into play?\n\nIs it possible to have an extreme case of Bell Clapper develop later in life? Does torsion always involve pain? I'm afraid to even attempt to move them down because they just don't feel normal, and because I don't want to mess anything up if anything is even wrong with them. Is there a method or are there any methods to correct this surgically?\n\nI am just shaky and nervous and scared because I have never experienced anything like this. Is it purely psychological or could there be something very wrong with me? As far as I know I haven't injured my testicles in any way. So I'm not sure if the reason why they are so elastic and then quickly tighten would be due to low testosterone production in my body. Sorry about all the questions, it's just that its 5:55am and I really don't know what to do or if there is anything anyone can do and I have gotten no sleep because of this, what am I supposed to do, stand up and sleep?  \n\n\nNote that this has never been an issue before, I've been able to go to sleep without having to solely sleep flat on my back to prevent any possible torsion, but lately its all I have done because I wouldn't want to turn over in bed and end up with something like torsion.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTIA to those who reply!",

I had postnasal drip, which caused me to cough violently, to the point of vomiting up mucus. I ended up with a bloodshot eye and backache for a week as a result.\n\nDuring this time, there were certain foods and drinks that made me feel more congested, so I avoided those at the time. This was mostly dairy, spicy and tomato-based foods. I also stopped drinking Diet Coke (which was no bad thing). Strangely, I seemed to get on best with tea and coffee (both with a lot of milk), water and fruit juice. \n\nAfter the worst of it cleared up, I did end up restoring some of these foods/drinks (e.g. Italian food, cheese, curry, occasional Diet Coke), but have not been able to go back to others (e.g. chocolate, creamy desserts, ice cream). For about six months afterwards, if I ate some of the foods in the latter category, I would get more congested and have a one-off coughing/vomiting fit to clear the mucus.\n\nSince then, even those fits have subsided but I have maintained most of the dietary changes above. However, a few months ago, I found I was getting a tickling sensation in my chest (around the sternum), when I drank quite a bit of pineapple juice, so now I've stopped drinking it. Last week, I found I started getting the same sensation from drinking some Appletiser and some orange juice, so now I'm wondering if fruit juice is aggravating some damage caused by the sinusitis.\n\nCan you please give me some idea if any of this fits with long-term effects of sinusitis and if these are likely to be long-lasting? Why am I suddenly getting some intolerance to fruit juice out of nowhere? I'm not allergic to anything.",

The CDC says to start rabies treatment no matter what. While other ER doctors are like \"did anyone touch it? Then don't worry about it\" while our GP said the same thing. Then we hear anecdotal stories about people saying it was in their house and someone died of rabies. So we don't know what to think.\n\nAgain, no one in the house touched it and we saw it immediately when it came into the living room, as it was dusk and it was trying to find a way out. I would say the bat was in our house for less than 24 hours, first in our basement, then in our living room for about an hour while we were trying to shepherd it out.",

        "I\u2019ve had this rash that\u2019s been progressing for 2 weeks. \n\n2 days ago I went to urgent care and 3 doctors looked at it and they\u2019re unsure what it is. They said it presents like a lot of things. \n\nThey gave me an antibiotic for yeast to take once a week for 4 weeks, as well as a topical antifungal cream (which I had already been applying for a few days) and a cream for folliculitis. I\u2019ve been applying antifungal for about 6 days and the cream and pills for 3 days. \n\nI\u2019m seeing a dermatologist on Tuesday but man am I stumped. It\u2019s getting more circular borders and every few days it looks different. The first picture is from about 2 weeks ago. It just seems to be getting worse and more red despite the medicine. It\u2019s about 3 inches in size on my buttcheek.\n\nDoes it look serious enough to go back to urgent care? \nhttps://imgur.com/a/kinoYEZ",

        "I own and occasionally wear four hand-knitted \u00c1lafoss Lopi Icelandic wool thongs (pics: [1](https://i.imgur.com/Jw8gizo.jpg), [2](https://i.imgur.com/5SB7iyB.png)). They are reserved for one of two situations: either it's really cold outside and I intend to wear a dress/skirt, or it's a special occasion of some sort. For those of you who don't know, Icelandic wool is famous for its rustic quality and texture. In other words, it is incredibly itchy. Most people advise against wearing it against your bare skin for this reason. I go into detail about why I wear them [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/BDSMAdvice/comments/clcaba/based_on_this_description_would_it_be_accurate_to/), but the long and short of it is that they make me feel sexy and confident. The only question is, could it be hazardous to my health?\n\nPutting the lopi thong on is actually a process. First, I get myself cleaned up. I always make sure that I am 100% spotless down there before getting dressed (if it matters, I use wet wipes to do this). After that's out of the way, I take a topical [moisturizing massage cream](https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B0008E8KC8), dab a cotton ball with it, and swab it around the area just outside my sensitive bits. This is to keep everything soft and moist. When it comes time to put the thong on, I start by pulling it up as normal. Then when it's near the waist, I squat and physically pull my buttocks apart as I tug the G-string (or whatever you call [this thing](https://i.imgur.com/N0eDF6z.jpg)) all the way up until I can feel it lining against the back. I lace up the strings as tightly as I can \u2013 not to the extent that it affects circulation, but enough so that the fabric is always in direct contact with my body, front to back. I adjust as needed, and then I go about my day as usual.\n\nWhen I wear a lopi thong, it's usually for about 10 or so hours at a time, the length of a full school day. How often I wear them depends on the time of year. In the winter, I might wear them maybe 4-5 times a month. Otherwise, it's extremely sporadic; I've only worn them a few times since spring. One of these was my birthday in June, when I dressed up and wore a lopi thong underneath to commemorate the occasion. Between school and going out with family, I had it on from early in the morning (~6:30 am) until around 8:30 in the evening. If it matters what I wear over top, I don't think I've ever worn a lopi thong without also wearing control top pantyhose. They compress it significantly, so it's never noticeable underneath my clothes. As for using the washroom, I carry a full box of wet wipes and clean *extremely* thoroughly after I finish my business.\n\nAre there some health risks to take into consideration for me doing this?\n\n* Age: 26\n\n* Sex: F\n\n* Height: 5'11\"\n\n* Weight: 190 lbs\n\n* Race: Caucasian\n\n* Duration of complaint: N/A\n\n* Geographic location: Canada\n\n* Location on body: Groin, genitals\n\n* Any existing relevant medical issues (if any): N/A\n\n* Current medications (if any): Sertraline (150mg daily)",

        "*Personal information at bottom of post.*\n\nTo set the stage, I work as a consultant for one of the major consultancies so I'm in an environment where I'm asked to perform analytical tasks, and as so really value the ability to maintain mental clarity. Although, I've had significant trouble obtaining this clarity, and about 2.5 years ago, it got to a point where I was forced to step back and attempt to unwind it. After a plethora of elimination diets and working to sort through this with my very helpful physician, I came to understand that my onsets of mental disorientation, as I dubbed it in the title, were due to the foods I was consuming. What I mean by mental disorientation is not a slight \"I'm feeling off today\" (as many people are quick to ask) but rather a complete inability to analytically problem solve, or even function. I realized that after eating the food and drinks I've identified below, a couple different ways I can describe the mental feeling are a 3 hour stint of:\n\n1. Feeling detached from my physical body where I'm observing myself interact with the world\n2. Feeling the mental portion of being drunk, without the physical effects\n\nTo circle back to the aforementioned foods, after having no known food allergies prior to this starting, I've noticed that the following foods affect me to varying degrees (I'll use a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 being complete and utter disorientation), and oddly enough they all seem to be foods that get classified as allergens. As an aside, the mental onset happens even if a food doesn't contain the ingredient but was processed in a facility that does, as noted by the packaging:\n\n* Dairy - 10\n* Soy - 6\n* Wheat - 3\n* Nuts - 3\n* Beer - 5\n* Processed in facility with soy, dairy, gluten - 2-6\n\nOnce I became aware of these foods, I've almost completely eliminated them from my diet (fun right?) and have been extremely committed to keeping them out. This led me to a place where my mental clarity hit about 35% of what it once was 3 years ago, but I still couldn't find the additional 65%. I then went to my environment and started to adjust factors there. What I came to find out, is that when I paid attention to it, the mental disorientation was also happening after I showered, which would not only have the mental onset but would also have sinus congestion. When I started piecing this together, I realized I also consumed a lot of the tap water, albeit filtered, in addition to the showering. I did some light chemical testing of the water and was seeing the results come back high compared to surrounding suburbs.\n\nThis may sound crazy, but being at a point of complete despair, I decided to completely stop showering at my apartment (I replaced this with daily trips to the gym to shower, in addition to my regular workouts) as well as completely stoping the drinking tap water and replacing it with spring water. I also made it a priority to move to a new dwelling, and have been out of that apartment for about 3 months now. With all of these changes, I feel like I've been able to get my mental state back to 75% of what it was, but that last 25% is extremely elusive. I also feel like my efforts so far have been treating the symptoms but as so I'm constantly avoiding \"land mines\" where foods unexpectedly give me disorientation, and haven't seen significant improvement.\n\nThe last piece of information in this puzzle is that my physician recently had a liver test carried out (after international travel) and this inadvertently exposed the fact that my ALT enzymes were showing up as 97 IU/L, when all of my other blood testing was almost perfectly within range. My doctor also tested for hepatitis and HIV, both of which were negative.  This lead me to an ultrasound of the liver that showed, according to the tech but unconfirmed by a specialist, that I had (non-alcoholic) fatty liver going on. I'm scheduled to see a liver specialist next week but this leads me to a bunch of overlying questions that I hope /askdocs might be able to help with:\n\n1. Could possible chemicals in the water at the apartment have onset this mental disorientation from food?\n2. How long could something like this take to unwind? I lived in the specific apartment where I had major issues for about 2 years, but lived in the same apartment building for 4 year in total.\n3. Could enzymes being released by my liver after the inability to digest food be causing the onset of mental disorientation?\n4. Are there any other causes for symptoms similar to mine (if we forget the liver portion of the post for a minute) that would create the mental disorientation onsets?\n5. Is there anything else that I might want to explore with these symptoms?\n6. I've tried natural anti-inflammatory foods (honey, ginger, etc.) to try to reduce the mental disorientation when it onsets, but is there anything else that might help me alleviate the symptoms to function in my day to day life?\n7. I've also been trying intermittent fasting where I constrain my eating window from 1PM to 8:00PM daily, and I'm unsure if this has been effective in giving my liver a chance to heal. Any thoughts on if I should continue this?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you for any help you can provide!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOther interesting results to note:\n\n* I did a full set of skin allergy testing for all of the above mentioned foods, all of which came back negative.\n* Celiacs testing came back negative.\n* All other organs looked good in the ultrasound.\n* Alcohol was cut out of my diet stringently once fatty liver was found, and waiting for specialist.\n* My wife has mentioned I smell \"garlicy\" at times when I haven't eaten anything with garlic\n* I am not exhibiting yellowing of the skin/eyes. Here are the results from my liver panel:\n   * Bilirubin - 0.8 mg/dL\n   * ALK Phosphatase - 61 IU/L\n   * ALT (SGPT) - 97 IU/L\n   * AST (SGOT) - 51 IU/L\n* Here are other panels that came back completely normal, in terms of blood work:\n   * CBC W PLT NO DIFF\n   * LIPID PANEL W REFLEX MEASURED LDL\n   * TSH WITH REFLEX\n   * VITAMIN D 25 (DEFICIENCY)\n   * MAGNESIUM\n   * ANTI HIV 1/2\n   * ACUTE HEPATITIS PANEL\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Age:** 26\n* **Sex:** M\n* **Height:** 6ft 0in\n* \\*\\*Weight:\\*\\*165\n* **Race:** Caucasian\n* **Activity Level:** Workout 3-4 times per week, mostly weight lifting and rec sports\n* **Duration of complaint:** 2.5 yrs\n* **Location on body:** Brain\n* **Any diagnosed medical issues:** No\n* **Current medications and doses:** No medication\n* **Alcohol consumption:** 1-4 drinks per week prior to cutting it all out after fatty liver was found.\n* **Any recreational drugs:** Very limited marijuana use (&lt;2 per year)\n* **Smoking status:** Non-smoker",

The spot is on my groin and I don't have any spots on my genital.

I'm now devastated, and don't know what to do. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1 - How are the chances that the doctor maybe has misdiagnosed me?\n\n2 - Are there any reliable blood tests that I could take in order to check for the HPV?\n\n3 - If I got sure that I have HPV, what could I do about my future sex life? what are my options?",

Family Hx: type II diabetes, heart attack (grandfather), rheumatoid arthritis (grandmother), HYPOtension, hypothyroidism (mother), elevated LDL (father)\n\nHaven\u2019t gotten to the bottom of this yet. I\u2019m an MS2 and I\u2019ve had odd circulatory issues since I was an early teenager, including high blood pressure readings in and out of the doctor\u2019s office. My extremities (especially legs and feet but also hands) always tend to get and stay cold for extended periods of time. This has included ED problems as well. It feels as if something is constricting and blocking off blood flow. I will get what feels like a kink in garden hose sensation in my legs daily, followed by a brief pulsatile feeling in the thighs. The feeling is not painful but slightly ticklish or itchy and uncomfortable. This will sometimes eventually result as cramping and tingling in my legs, tingling especially occurs in heat. I will also occasional get pressure sesnations in my head and chest pains / heart flutters. \n\n\nI\u2019ve studied that baroreceptors normalize with chronically high blood pressure so sensation is highly unlikely but I think I may be experiencing constant fluctuations in blood pressure instead. I would estimate my average blood pressure reading to be 139/88 but it seems to easily get to 160/90 with just a small amount of caffeine (4 oz or less of coffee) or while I am studying (had someone take it during this time). \n\nWhat I have tried so far: exercising daily (no blood pressure improvements and in fact, weightlifting seems to increase), peripherally acting CCBs (up to 10 mg Amlodipine to no effect), compression socks (just gives me sweaty feet) \n\nTests/Results: Stress Echo (normal imaging, doc noted \u201dmax sustained HR was very high, pushed himself too hard on treadmill. HR extended period to normalize\u201d) Kidney workup (normal save for high BUN), Autonomic workup (falls below normal percentile for Valsalva maneuver, notable increase in HR upon standing but not clinical fit for POTS); CBC, thyroid, A1C all normal. Only positive test was for neuronal antibodies, Ach esterase antibodies were high - absent of cancer. Doc said this could be autoimmune and not sure it would tell us anything about blood pressure. Also noted abdominal pains may be caused by this but since I\u2019m not \u201dvomiting\u201d it is unlikely. \n\nThis is kind of where I sit. Really want to exact treatment as much as possible.",

It only was an issue when a cold went to my chest. I didnt take meds regularly except for those times. \n\nIn june I noticed a rattling of mucus in my chest. I went to the doc, they gave me a steroid. Since then it hasnt left. I have been seeing an asthma doc/allergist since july. She diagnosed uncontrolled asthma and said my lungs were functioning like a 70 yr old. She gave me a cocktail of drugs that we have since manipulated. Right now it's symbicort, ventolin, and mucinex D. I was taking symbicort but I didnt like how I felt.with it. She said I could stop.\n\nMy lung function improved to 62. Woo. She added a nasal spray. \n\nRelated note- I tend to feel better outside my home, so I am working to isolate whether there is a trigger. Allergist tested and found dust to be a huge trigger so doing a bunch of work in that regard to clean up. Not mu ch improvement yet but hoping. \n\nYesterday I started feeling just generally less energy and really still full of mucus. Still Having to clear my chest like every couple minutes. Some clear white gunk comes out but not a lot. So today I went to urgent care. Said lungs sounded fine and clear. She did a chest xray which she said has nothing super emergent but did say I has some nodules which is freaking me out. She seems to think that the nodules are not cancer and rather connected to my asthma and the last two months of crap. She did not seem concerned but I am a worrier. She is having me follow up with a chest CT and said given all that I have been dealing with I should see a pulmonologist, which I will do. But I am freaking out. What are the odds these nodules are connected to my asthma and not something very very serious? I know you all cant diagnose and I am following up, but anything that could.help me sleep.tonight would be appreciated.",

        "I've always been curious about my body fat percentage and I finally just bought myself some skin fold calipers and decided to measure myself. \nI have before estimated by eye and got 7%. When I grab my flesh it just feels like skin, like when you grab your arm, feels quite thin.\nThese are my measurements:\nAbdomen=4mm\nBicep=2mm\nTricep=2mm\nSubscapular=5mm\nSuprailiac=3mm\nChest=2mm\nThigh=4mm\nMidaxilliary=2mm\nLower back=4mm\nCalf=4mm\n\n\nJp 3 type=2.33% - 1.3kg\nJp 4 type=2.24% - 1.2kg\nJp 7 type=2.09% - 1.1kg\nDW 4 type=2.10% - 1.1kg\n\nWhat I dont understand is this is apparently impossible and at the least dangerous. \n\nBut I've been this build all my life, I've had visible abs since I was 8-9 years old from when I would spend hours climbing around on my climbing frame. \nI've always been quite fit and healthy. As a kid I would rather eat fruit than chocolate and cakes. And strangely people comment on how strong I am.\n\nAnother weird thing is I'm 5'8 and 54kg but I eat over 2000 calories a day easily. At weekends I eat around 3000 a day. Weekdays are normally 2000-2400. But overall average is 15k-18k calories a week.\n\nThe only strange part of my diet is i often just have a big glass of milk for breakfast and eat lunch at 12. But after that i just eat when I'm hungry and stop when I'm full. I have a big dinner. Also when I was checking my nutrition I'd have  40% carbs, 40% fat and 20% protein. That appears to be what I crave because I dont follow a diet. If anything carbs might be a little higher and fat a little lower. \n\nWhat im asking is am I not at as much of a risk because my body seems to naturally be this percentage of body fat or am I doing something that's bad? \n\nSo either the calipers I used are bad, though I did measure my gf who is apparently skinny according to my family and she got 21%. Which is lower end of healthy. \nShe also did my measurements and got the same answers. \nI have also checked them against a ruler. And when the pressure indicators are lined up it reads the right value. \nAnother possibility is they require too strong a pressure to get the accurate reading thus squashing my skin to small measurements. \n\nOr I am actually around 2%. I always thought id be extreme low. And the by eye estimate at 7% where I was guessing 5mm and 10mm increments thought was about right. \n\nI can post pictures taking the measurements if that helps identify if I am doing it incorrectly.",

(i could barely move my head at all without severe pain, even moving my eyes to extreme angles would cause pain). this subsides but returns frequently with differing severity, some days are unbearable and some days have just mild discomfort.\n\n\u200b\n\nsome odd symptoms :\n\n\u200b\n\n\\* i always have to crack my neck and stretch, if i do not do it for too long it gets severely uncomfortable - i literally cannot go over a few minutes without having to move/crack my neck.\n\n\\* anything that limits movement of my neck exacerbates this, too tight shirt collars, necklaces, backpacks, carrying bags, someone putting their arm around me or restricting my movement in some way. even having too long hair and having it have friction with the pillow when i sleep can cause discomfort(!). \n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\nI've had similar symptoms with other body parts like my hands or feet which seems to suggest to me this is some psychosomatic issue (for example, i remember as a kid hating to wear socks in the proper way because the liner inside by the toes would keep bringing my attention to my feet and i would have to twitch my toes constantly, i would basically wear my socks inside out to prevent this). i really do not know how to go about treating this and niether do the doctors i've seen.\n\n\u200b\n\ni know this is a strange one but any help or ideas would be most welcome.",

It\u2019s a burning itchy sensation but I can also easily ignore it. \nYesterday I woke up and noticed my left lymph node in my neck was visibly swollen and sort of hard but easily movable. It was not tender. The one on my right side near the rash was also swollen but a little tender. \n\nToday the right side is a bit larger and still slightly tender, but so is the rash above it so that could be it. \n\nLeft is either the same size or larger, slightest bit tender but could be from me touching it nervously. \n\nI am exposed to mosquito bites and in central IN, where West Nile has been diagnosed before.\n\nI have never had mono before, and other possibilities could include spider bites? I\u2019ve walked through a few garden spider webs recently and did get an angry one out of my hair from near the back of my neck 5-7 days ago.

I had a small bruise on my knee last night, and now see 3 more and I haven't been injured at all.\n\nA week ago after sitting at work all day, I get up and it felt like part of my leg was asleep, but it wouldn't go away. I felt the area right above my knee, and it was numb. Right where the numbness is, I can feel something. When I press down and move my fingers over it, it feels sort of ridged. It feels like if I had a small shoelace in my leg going horizontal. It's small, about the size of a nickel. In the morning when I wake up, most of the feeling is back in that area. When I get up I get a strong tingling sensation, and the area gets numb again. \n\nI went to the ER a week ago as I thought the numbness was serious but they weren't concerned about it at all. They did an ultrasound where they looked at the veins in the area just to make sure it wasn't anything like a clot. They said it was probably muscle strain.\n\nA week later and now I suddenly have bruises on my knee. I have not hit my leg at all. I had one last night, and now it's darker with three other bruises around it.\n\nBeside my knee I also just noticed two small red blotches that feel like a bruise when I press into them.

I have not been able to find many correlations with this symptom, except that I sometimes experience an accompanying PVC during the tight sensation, or right before it starts up again. The PVC's occur roughly 3-6 times a day, and sometimes startle me if they feel an especially hard thud. The more tight my throat feels at the time, the stronger this thud sensation tends to be.\n\nExercise does not seem to make it better or worse, except that I am now avoiding exercise due to the discomfort and anxiety it causes. I have previously been to an ENT about this, who did not find anything unusual - although he did comment that my throat muscles looked tightened, but I believe this may have just been because I was tensing up due to being anxious about the examination.\n\nI guess my first concern is to rule out the possibility of it being heart related, although I already doubt this option since the symptoms are nearly constant regardless of physical activity. I've had a 24h holter monitor before, which confirmed the PVC's, but found nothing else unusual. I've had an ultrasound before and know my heart is structurally normal. My pulse and blood pressure are also fine.\n\nIf we can rule that out, I really would just like to get to the bottom of this problem finally that has been bothering me for months, so I can live normally again.

        "Hello there!\n\nI'm a 30 year old man living in Sweden. I don't smoke or take any other drugs, other than literally a single beer, or perhaps two, during the course of the weekend. I exercise regularly and otherwise eat healthy. I don't drink coffee.\n\nThe 14th of June I took a full course of antibiotics for 14 days (the medication is called \"K\u00e5vepenin\" in Sweden, a so-called \"penicillin V\" type of antibiotics) in order to thwart what might have been Lyme disease. I experienced a pretty bothersome nausea during the cure, but after having taken the full course of the medication for two weeks I began to feel better. I stopped using the medication on the 28th of June.\n\nFast-forward 2-3 weeks after the 28th of June, and I started to experience some severe bouts of nausea. It came and went for a time, only for it to settle seemingly permanently, and that's were I am now. I feel constantly nauseous, and while some days are slighly better, every day I still have to experience this very annoying and irritating nausea that sometimes really do hinder me from accomplishing everyday tasks.\n\nI went to see the doctor, who took a look at my general health and such, and she couldn't find anything wrong with my body in particular. She thought that it might have been the course of antibiotics that screwed me over by killing all the good bacteria in my stomach and wrecking general havoc (I already have a sensitive stomach, what with my IBS and all), and her proposed solution was to simply wait it out and toughen through it.\n\nHere's the thing though: she claims that the nausea can take **several months** to dissipate.\n\nI suppose it's a good thing that it will likely go away at some point, but several months? Does it truly take that long for the body, with the stomach in particular, to heal from the antibiotics? I read everywhere that it can take some weeks for everything to return to normal, but several months? Note that I've stopped drinking coffee completely for the last two weeks, and I only take one measly beer on the evenings of saturdays in order to liven things up a bit. I eat healthy and regularly exercise, and as such, I shouldn't be stressing my stomach out too much.\n\nI suppose my question to you medically knowlegable is this: is it normal for the body to heal for months after a course of antibiotics?\n\nCheers!",

        "Hi, guys! I put my info on the bottom of the post. Welcome to my medical mystery. Thank you for any advice or insights. :)\n\nAlmost three years ago my terrible nail picking habit damaged my thumb nail bad enough that I had a massive growth of proud flesh under the nail on my left thumb. Doctors didn't know what to do, and finally they just removed the entire nail - badly, damaging the nail matrix bad enough that the nail never grew back, aside from a layer of flaky hard skin that continuously cracked. The tissue (protruding about 0.8 cm from my nail bed) regenerated fast enough to heal these wounds in a matter of hours. I had constant infections under the cuticle. Despite using steroid ointments (STRONG ones), and finally a period of silver nitrate bandages, the flesh grew back bigger than before, covering most of the nail bed.\n\nFinally, a surgeon removed the last of the nail matrix and nail bed with phenol a couple of days ago. He was reluctant to do it, but having explained that I've been turned away from several doctors (podiatrists, dermatologists and my GP included) he agreed to do it - despite being an orthopaedic surgeon. I know I will never get my nail back, but after 2,5 years of constant pain and infections I'm mostly relieved. \n\nGoogle isn't helpful (all I can find are images of partial nail avulsions and texts saying \"it'll grow back\"), and I can't figure out what the chances are that the lump of flesh will grow back. This is my biggest concern, because it regenerated at such an insane speed whenever I had a cut or crack. First time it was removed, it had grown back by the time I got home from urgent care. Most doctors I've seen have told me to call them if I ever figure it out, or tried to remove the flesh without numbing me up, assuming there's a pocket of puss under the skin.\n\nDoes anyone have any experience with this? Does anyone know what my thumb will end up looking like, or what consequences not having a thumb nail could have? I'm massively grateful for any insight anyone could have, because all I can find is information about ingrown toenails and horses, for whatever reason.\n\n[Pictures before first nail removal, a month after, and then after complete removal two days ago.](https://imgur.com/a/CZCWPRU) Apologies for the snapchat captions, these are the best photos I have.\n\nThank you for any insight into this. I appreciate any tidbits of advice or information anyone can give me. :) :) \n\nInfo: Biological female, caucasian, 165 cm, 80 kg. 32 years old, medical conditions: Asthma, allergies.

After about a month, when I wasn't seeing any effects, the dose was increased to 300 mg. A few days after the increase, I started feeling extremely dizzy.

When I found out I was 4wks pregnant, (my former) ob had me start taking vitapearl prenatal once daily and ordered bloodwork. Due to results she had me start taking 65mg iron/325mg ferrous sulfate poll twice a day. *Results 6/17/2019 at 4wks pregnant (9wks ago):*\n\n- normal: WBC 4.3, RBC 3.8, platelet 352, MPV 9.2\n- low: HGB 8.2, HCT 28.6, MCV 75.3, MCH 21.6, MCHC 28.7, ABS neutrophils 1329\n- high: RDW 15.6\n\nAlso normal: Lymphocytes %, ABS lymphocyte, abs monocyte, eosinophils %, ABS eosinophils, basophil %, ABS basophils, Neutrophils %, monocytes %\n\nI didn\u2019t understand fully then how to take iron pills for best absorption, so often took them w orange juice but also w meals or close in time to consuming tannins/dairy/calcium. 3wks later, (my former) ob had me also start taking 1 mg folic acid pill w one of my iron pills. (My former) ob kept asking me if I had some blood issue or condition or if anyone in my family did - which is confusing since I\u2019m the patient and told her all I know (mom, sister anemic; I don\u2019t know if any sickle cell or any issues).\n\nAt 7/22/2019, 8wks pregnant (~5wks ago), I saw 2 new obs to decide who to switch to &amp; ended up getting 2 blood draws on same day for more bloodwork. The ob I chose asked me to increase 65mg iron pills to 3x/day and I\u2019ve been taking them with 500mg vitamin C at least 1hr before food and at least 2hrs after food. I\u2019ve refrained from tannins/dairy/calcium for at least 1hr before iron and at least 2hrs after. *7/22/2019, 8wks pregnant (~5wks ago) results (2 sets of some results):*\n\n- normal: WBC 5.09, nRBC 0/100, RBC 4.06, MCV 80.5 (81), platelet 236, HGB A 96.7%, HGB F 1.3%, HGB A2 quant, 2%, normal phenotype\n- low: RBC 3.74, HGB 10.1 (9.5), HCT 32.7 (30.3%), MCH 24.9 (25.4), MCHC 31.4\n- high: RDW 22.6 (24.1)\n\n*one set of bloodwork had RBC normal; the other had RBC low\n\nI just saw my ob yesterday (ran a half marathon 5 days prior) &amp; got new bloodwork drawn. (New, great) Ob is concerned abt anemia; also trying to ask questions to see if I have some issue making this happen. Referred me to see a hematologist on Thursday. *8/23/2019, ~13-14wks pregnant (yesterday) results:*\n\n- normal: ferritin 33.5, Iron 110, TIBC 345, iron saturation 32%, UIBC 235, WBC 4.63, nRBC 0/100, RBC 3.93, MCV 87, MCH 27.5, MCHC 31.6, platelet 227, HGB A 96.7%, HGB F 1.3%, HGB A2 quant, 2%, normal phenotype\n- low: HGB 10.8, HCT 34.2%\n- high: RDW 21.4, monocytes 13.8%\n\nAlso normal: segmented %, ABS neutrophil, Lymphocytes %, ABS lymphocyte, abs monocyte, eosinophils, ABS eosinophils, basophil %, ABS basophils, IMM GRAN, ABS IMM GRAN\n\nI\u2019d love to make sure I have all bloodwork done that the hematologist would need for diagnosis so we can finally start treating the actual cause of this anemia. \n\nIs it possible that I\u2019ve had iron deficiency anemia (or some type of microcytic anemia) and it\u2019s just going to take a while for HGB and HCT to catch up? Or, since I\u2019m not iron, B12, or folate deficient (and MCV and MCH are normal now), is my anemia normocytic and it likely has some other cause?\n\nIf the latter, then, from what I understand, it\u2019s likely either some type of aplastic anemia or some type of hemolytic anemia? Is it right that it doesn\u2019t look like aplastic anemia (marrow not producing enough blood) bc I make normal white blood cells and platelets just fine?\n\nThen, does it look like it is probably some type of hemolytic anemia (where my red blood cells are destroyed or die faster than I can produce them)? If so, then I probably want to bring this up w my ob earlier so I can get a reticulocytes count done before my hematologist appt. Is there any other bloodwork that it might make sense to have done in advance so the hematologist has the necessary results on Thursday? \n\nIt\u2019s been taking so long to diagnose what\u2019s going on w me and it worries me that we might not have actually even begun to treat whatever is causing this anemia. I\u2019m basically out of the first trimester and, while being anemic during labor increases maternal mortality etc., being anemic in first and second trimesters can increase preterm labor, lead to low birth weight, etc. Even from whenever we figure out the cause of my anemia, it\u2019ll probably take &gt;4wks for my HGB and HCT to increase to be normal and it seems pregnancy will only worsen anemia. Less importantly, I\u2019d love to ask my drs abt reducing or eliminating this iron if I don\u2019t need it bc it is a hassle to be nauseous on top of pregnancy nausea and to space food out so much etc if it isn\u2019t necessary. (Taking iron doesn\u2019t constipate me at all.)\n\nThanks for any thoughts or directions. Trying to see how to help this move fwd faster and if there are additional tests to ask to get blood drawn for before Thursday. My blood work results appear same day usually.",

        "In prison we are inundated with a variety of synthetic drugs such as \"flacca\",\"molly\",k2/spice,and suboxone/subutex. There primary reason is the ability to pass normal 7 panel urine tests and cost/profit margins.\nI have been an avid drug user since 89 and still don't like being sober. However as I've emarked on my 44 year in life and entered my last year of a very lengthy prison sentence due to my voracious drug addiction, I conceded to myself that things needed to change if I wanted to remain a free man from here on out. My first  experience with suboxone was an attempt to shake my k2 addiction that I developed while in prison. A cellie of mine was dealing in whole strips and slivers of the 8 mg\n variety of suboxone and offered me a 10th strip.(he cuts a whole 8mg strip into 10 slivers and sells them for 10 dollars land money),(land money is canteen items).\nAnyways after ingesting this sliver and allowing it to take effect I felt great. I didnt crave or Jones for the k2, I was extremely on point socially and kept a very strong  and pleasant attitude. This never dissipated over time as I maintained the daily use of the 10 strips for about 6 months before a route,(source), got popped. The after effect or detox of the drug was marginal at best and I didnt immediately return back to k2 as a remedy for my  \nanti sobriety philosophy. Matter of fact I realized that I probably have some mental health issues associated with my long on going romance with drugs and its accompanied culture. My question is this, since doctors often prescribe antidepressants that are usually a stimulant of one kind and or another, does it seem dumb to goto the doctor and explain my findings and request suboxone as my add/depressant behavioral problems. Or am I simply swapping one addiction with a self prescribed medication that is not used as what it is intended for. Anyone else had experience with this type of drug or heard of this being done? I can see the concerns of over medicating but guys in prison are snorting welbutrin and effector for a high and those are too strong a stimulant for my use because it wakes up the crack bug in me and leaves me romancing my past drug addiction. I've been off crack cocaine since 2010 and it took me 5 years of nightly crack dreams to finally be comfortable with saying that I enjoy not having that as a precursor to my existence. Sorry if this is a long post..I've been in prison for 9 years with a year to go and am at a work release center in south florida right in the epicenter of shit. Current life was a unicorn inside the wire and support a double headed unicorn. Thanks for your honesty.",

It was around December. I had it all, fever and whatnot. There was even a day where I couldn't breath properly that was similar to sleep apnea. The literal sensation waking up because of my need to breath was very concerning, but this lasted for a day or two. \n\nNow, it was around that time that it started. Along with the cold, I was extremely stress from a lot of things, matters of my family and worries of my sickness because some symptoms didn't go away. It was January I believe, but I'll continue. I was sitting on the couch with a lot of concerns in mind when I suddenly felt dizzy, I actually felt something like a strong zapping sensation in my head, around the area in occipital area. I don't know if I burned out or it was something else, but after that day I felt different. It's when it began. This strange dizziness that I can't explain. \n\nI wouldn't call it vertigo, I don't have any issues standing up or walking in a straight line. I don't have nausea or any chest pains.   Anyways, what I feel along with this strange dizziness is that is in sync with the rhythm of my heart, and along that I feel unsteady and a pulling or dropping sensation when I'm laying down, sitting and sometimes standing. This sensation is in sync with my heart as well. \n\nI did, however, had the scariest sensation when I went to the park. I literally felt my vision bounce, as if I was a shaking camera. My vision narrowed as well, however, I had no chest pains. I literally felt unbalance and extremely unsteady. \n\nI went to the ER and they did all sorts of tests, ekg, echo-cardiogram, and an x-ray. They found nothing. Anyways, there is only a finite amount tests they can do in the ER. I also had an mri done in my brain, but they found nothing. (if requested I don't mind posting them.)\n\nAnyways... \n\nSuffice to say, that the shaky camera sensation hasn't returned. However, I still feel the unsteady sensation. It concerns me because it is a sensation that seems to be in sync with my heart beat. It is constantly there and doesn't stop, unless I try to ignore it. It's worse at night since all of my senses are attuned to the sensation. I would also describe it is as if I'm laying on a waterbed that is being shaken or something is pulling me down. It also feels like my blood is being pumped with a bit more pressure to my brain. \n\nThere two additional symptoms, as mentioned in bold letters. There are these vibrations/vibration/bubble I feel in my left arm, and legs that I feel when laying down. My body doesn't shake or anything, it feels like it's something internal. The next would be the most annoying one. This one is strange, but it seems to exacerbate the feeling of unsteadiness. When I shake my leg or press on certain areas in the body or move in certain ways as I exercises and I feel this unsteadiness. \n\nThe only time I get relief is when I'm working out or walking, it helps me distract myself.\n\n,,,,\n\nPersonal note: I am aware that I might not get the answer I want. I would appreciate your honesty and any opinions that anyone of you can give me that can give me a lead as to what this is. Thank you.\n\nI will try to answer any questions as soon as I can, if any.",

He told me it wasnt severe enough to warrant emergency surgery but to go ahead and schedule one with the local surgeon. I did so, but had another attack and they performed emergency surgery. Laproscopic. The surgeon said my gallbladder was inflamed and one of the worst he's seen. Cue a 2 day hospital stay and i was sent home. A few days go by and i start feeling kind of sick. I started having gallbladder attack pain even though i didnt have a gallbladder anymore. Dark urine and jaundice soon to follow.  At my follow up they re-admit me to the hospital. They perform an ercp procedure and find 3 stones in a bile duct. Removed them of course. Cue abother 2 day hospital visit. Well, i have been nauseous and have the chills since the procedure. Was just wondering if that is normal. No more pain or jaundice. I am on a 5 day antibiotic though. But i feel sick as hell. Is this normal?

When I was driving I just waited it out and thought it was weird but last night it was more intense and I couldn't sleep because of it, I tried shaking voluntarily to relax it but it didn't work, I took my sweatshirt off and the change in temperature made it feel better enough so I could sleep, I didn't feel it when I woke up.\n\nI also had one time a week or so ago where I was about to fall asleep and I felt a jolt in my spine twice, like someone had sat over me, pressed their hands on one part of my back and pushed down twice like they were giving me cpr, though that might have not been been related cause I haven't had that since and it happened before this. Also, the day that cpr feeling happened I was stressed that my new apartment might have lead paint and I was reading about convulsions so it might have been a placebo like thing, even if I was or am being lead poisoned from my house which I'm almost certainly not I had only been here for a few days or like a week at that point.\n\nAlso it's worth noting that I've been having maybe the most stressful month of my life, I feel like a lot of weird health problems can be explained by stress.",

        "**Details:** 29 year old female / 110 lbs / 5'3\n\n**The Problem:**\n\nI've always been petite and I guess I took it for granted and just assumed I could eat whatever I wanted. I've always loved vegetables so I've always eaten a lot of them but I also ate a lot of junk (fries, pizza, nuggets, chips, etc.). Then, this past summer I suffered a major depressive episode. I have panic disorder but this was my first depressive episode. I alternated between not having the energy or desire to eat much of anything to only eating junk. I didn't gain weight but I felt like crap. I ended up going to the hospital because of the depression. My doctor put me on Celexa for my panic and depression. She also ran a blood panel and my bad cholesterol came back high (good cholesterol is at a nice level). My iron was low and so was my magnesium. I had slightly elevated calcium. All of this really scared me.   \n\n\n  \n**The Changes:**  \n\n\nThe Celexa has made a huge difference. I take it on schedule and the world seems a bit \"brighter\". I'm less afraid to talk to people now and my motivation regarding my work has increased. I have more energy. My doctor also prescribed iron supplements and magnesium supplements (prescription strength) which I've been taking as prescribed.  \n\n\nI cut down my alcohol intake. Before, I was drinking 2-3 glasses of wine almost every night because it would calm my anxiety. I cut down to one small glass every few days. I cut coffee down to one cup (black) versus the 4-5 cups (black) I was drinking every morning in the past.   \n\n\nI started going to bed earlier. Before the depression set in, I was sort of a workaholic and wouldn't go to bed until 2:00am most nights. Now, I'm usually in bed around 12:30 and I take at least an hour to relax before bed. \n\nI made big dietary changes. I now only eat red meat once a month. I mostly eat beans and legumes, plenty of vegetables, nuts, fatty fish and olive oil, occasional poultry (maybe once a week), and healthy grains (quinoa, oats, barley, etc.). I feel awesome. I don't eat many fruits but that's because I've never been much into sweets. For fruits I eat a handful of berries here and there or I add a banana to my unsweetened oats in the morning. I drink a lot more water, too. My doctor told me not to cut out all junk because it isn't sustainable long-term for most people. Every two weeks I allow myself a \"cheat\" night where I indulge in ONE thing I really like. Last time it was a small poutine. This time it's going to be samosas.   \n\n\nI've increased my activity. I'm not going to the gym all the time but I walk about 20-35 minutes almost every day and I go swimming once a week. I have a really demanding career so it's hard to get exercise time in. I hope to increase it in the future.   \n\n\n**Questions:**   \n\n\n1. I've had well-meaning friends say I'm not doing the right thing in terms of diet and that in order to lower cholesterol I need to consume less carbs. One friend said I should cut out the beans/legumes and healthy grains and concentrate on proteins and fats. She follows keto. Is the diet I described above ok or is there something I can do better? I'm not trying to lose weight, I just want to be healthy. In fact, I really don't want to lose ANY weight.\n2. How else can I increase my activity in a way that won't take up too much time every day? I'm assuming my small change in activity (the walking and swimming) won't do much health-wise even though it's making me feel better.\n3. A family member told me to stop my Celexa and look to herbs like St. John's Wort instead. She said that antidepressants cause addiction, change your personality, and over time can ruin creativity and cognitive functioning. This kind of sounds like bull to me but is there any truth to these claims? I'm doing really well on the medication. I'm finally not in a constant state of panic or depression.",

Suspected MCAS (pending tryptase test to be done during next flare). Had a vestibulectomy in January to treat vestibular adenitis, and then had it repeated in June when the first one was unsuccessful. Had an issue with excessive bleeding after the second surgery and had to return to the hospital for extra stitches. Currently 9 weeks post-op and doing well. Suspected craniocervical instability and Chiari malformation, pending MRIs that have been ordered. Suspected central sleep apnea, pending sleep study that has been ordered.\n\nAfter my first surgery, I had a really bad autoimmune flare, which my doctor believes was due to MCAS. It was controlled with antihistamines and steroids. After my second surgery, I did not have an autoimmune flare, but I had a bad reaction with my heart. I had always gotten winded easily (even as a kid, I couldn't run around like the other kids my age without my heart racing out of my chest), but after my surgery, it got so bad that I had to sit on the floor to brush my teeth. After my echo showed MVP, I was diagnosed with hEDS by diagnostic criteria. I have not undergone genetic testing yet, but I will eventually.\n\nThe metoprolol helps immensely, but there are a couple of things it hasn't helped. First, my hands shake like crazy. You'd think I were really nervous or something, but it's just that my hands aren't steady. They don't feel weak, they just shake. It's not all the time. It comes and goes. But it's very annoying.\n\nSecond (and this is the main reason for my post), my pulse hurts sometimes. I get a pain in areas where I have major veins. Most commonly in my neck (carotid artery), but also once in my wrist, and today I got it in the top of my thigh. It usually lasts for about 5-10 seconds. I massage the area while it's happening because it feels like it needs it, and it usually goes away after a bit. It happens...maybe on average once a day? I don't think this happened before my second surgery, but I might just not have thought about it as much since my recent diagnoses.\n\nMy fear is that this could be indicative of a vascular component with my EDS. Clearly there is some vascular involvement, but it has been limited so far. My echo did not show aortic root dilation or any other issues apart from MVP. That being said, my first cardiologist was awful. He said my echo and ekg were both perfectly fine. I had to ask him three times to double check the results before he saw the MVP. And the ekg tech clearly reported arrhythmias on my ekg, which the doctor didn't even acknowledge. So I'm not confident something else wasn't missed on the echo, and I plan to ask my new cardiologist to take a look. He's a genetic cardiologist and should have an eye for what to look out for the most.\n\nIf anyone can provide any insight into what might be causing the pain and whether or not I should be worried, I would greatly appreciate it.\n\nThanks so much!",

It started about two days after taking some paracetamol for some abdominal pain and dulcolax for some constipation. I thought they were linked so I stopped taking the paracetamol, but that didn't stop it. After a week I got a sore throat, my doctor took a look and said it was a bacterial infection and prescribed some azrithromycin. Took that for about a week, and I think the infection is almost gone? But I'm not sure because it's very difficult to swallow and my neck hurts. I also feel like my muscles all over ache kind when I move them. But above all, the one thing that's still there is the itching. There's no rash or anything and it's not on one specific place. Also after the first two weeks or so, I noticed that if I scratch a certain area red marks appear where i scratched, and then they fade away after some time. I also think I've been suffering from some reflux issues, but that hasn't been confirmed by my doctor, I'm just speculating based on symptoms.",

So 5 days ago I noticed my bellybutton was having some issues. It was \"crusty\" inside and painful. It felt like a sunburn, but my bellybutton has not been exposed to any sun. On day 3, I noticed it was more red and there was a ring of brown \"crust\" around my belly button. I washed it off and it didn't come back. But, since I first noticed symptoms, a firm, white lump has begun to form inside my bellybutton. The surrounding area is red, but the lump itself is pure white. It is still mildly painful, but when it comes in contact with clothing (especially when I bend down and my Jean's press into it) it becomes very painful, almost like touching an open wound. There has been a little bit of clear discharge that doesn't have a smell, but the lump itself doesn't seem to be leaking or draining. I have been applying Neosporin, but it doesn't seem to be improving. It's actually getting worse if anything. Over the past week I've been having some stomach issues (gas, nausea, diarrhea, etc.) as well as a lot of fatigue no matter how much or little I sleep, but I have been attributing that to increasing the dosage of my antidepressant, as these are the symptoms I usually get when my dose is increased. \n\nShould I go to a doctor, or is this not a big deal?

I've tried sleeping for 4.5hrs (1AM - 5:30AM) during the night, taking three 20-minute naps spaced out at 5 hour intervals. After about a week I started getting used to it until I read an article discussing the various health risks associated with getting less than 6 hours of sleep a night: heart problems, various cancers, etc. First I was off-put but then thought I could at least partially offset the effects by eating healthy and exercising (which I do). And so continued with my schedule until I read that less than 6 hours of sleep can also kill brain cells, cause alzheimers and various other illnesses associated with the brain. I was very concerned by this and began sleeping 8 hours. I've been reading more on brain cell damage from lack of sleep and there's a relatively small volume of research surrounding the subject. Does anybody have any ideas concerning this? Does lack of sleep effect mental functionality long term? And more importantly, is any damage incurred from lack of sleep permanent? Thank you",

        "I am an 18 year old Filipino male. I am 165 cm and 67.2 kg. This happened at 7:06 AM Philippine Standard Time on August 25, 2019 and posted this complaint around 7: 20 AM Philippine Standard. I only take either a vitamin c tablet and a vitamin to help with height growth called \"Cherifer\". I only vaped one time and never took any recreational drugs. In the past, I had appendicitis, chickenpox, and dengue. All cured now. Currently, my problem is assumed bleeding from my throat - at the upper front area. I felt no discomfort or pain at all from doing nothing to it, but when I gargled a handful of water - I spat it out and blood came out with it. The amount of blood was roughly 8-10% of the water. What can I do to prevent this becoming a big problem, if it's not one right now? Or any advice at all?",

Maybe happens 2-3 times per year, no pattern or apparent triggers. \n\nBasically what happens is that I feel the need to poop, and when I go to use the bathroom, I can't make anything happen. I don't push particularly hard, because I also have hemorrhoids and don't want to irritate those. \n\nBut after I've tried to poop, I have a pain in my anus. It feels like there's literally a rock trying to come out of me. And that pain persists for probably 30 minutes or so, accompanied by feeling VERY hot and sweaty, and dizzy too. I have to lay on the floor, remove clothes, use ice packs and fans. Then after about 30 minutes, it all dissipates over the course of a minute or two. There's no nausea involved, I never feel like I'm going to throw up or lose my bowels or anything. \n\nI'm not really sure how to Google this and nobody I know has ever experience anything like this. I don't know if I should be concerned at all, if I should see a doctor. Any thoughts or advice would be greatly appreciated!",

It doesn't feel like my stomach, nor does it feel at all similar to period pain. It only appeared around once a day in the evening hours, and lasted for only a few seconds at a time. I tried on a waist trainer the day it started and thought it had to do with that, so I took it off and threw it away. But it kept happening, and each day that passed by it began to get worse and worse in pain (escalating from an initial 3, to a 5, to an 7 on the pain scale, 10 being literally on fire). It also began to occur more than once a day, most frequently in the evenings but also when I just woke up and sometimes mid-day, especially if I am standing a lot that day. It hurts really bad when I try to poop, but I still poop at least once a day and they are normal, no constipation or diarrhea.  One morning when I woke up it began immediately, I went to the toilet to try to poop and it got so bad I was screaming and crying (at least an 8.5 on the pain scale if not a 9) and I finally decided to go to the doctor (I live in the US where health care is a joke and the costs of it are the punchline, so yes I waited as long as possible to go). The doctor thought it might be an ectopic pregnancy or related to my kidneys or urinary tract so they did a pregnancy test and pee test and didn't find anything. She then ordered an x-ray and a blood test, both of which came back normal, showing I wasn't backed up and nothing was out of place, nor any weird results from the blood test. She then ordered an ultrasound which checked everything in that area including my ovaries and the blood flow and appendix and everything and it still came back clear (the ultrasound was yesterday). The doctor legitimately said point blank she has no idea what to do and referred me to another doctor for a second opinion. It's been well over a month at this point and I am in near constant pain, usually a 5 but shoots up to that 8.5-9 pain multiple times a day, again mostly at night or when I try to poop. I don't seem to have any other symptoms other than slight nausea when the pain is very bad, I'm eating like normal, drinking water, etc. They have not given me anything at all to help nor have they given me the slightest idea as to what could be causing this. Frankly, I am confused, scared, and in pain, and I don't really know what to do. I'm considering just going into the ER tonight when the pain gets bad to see if they can get someone else to look at it sooner (as the appt she set with the next doc is not until wednesday and I don't think I can wait that long).\n\nI have tried googling my symptoms and legitimately cannot find anything that fits the bill. The best words I can use to describe it is it feels like there is an intestine in that area and someone has their fist tightly holding it and is pulling it apart. Is there someone else I should see? Is going to the ER even going to help? Is there a particular type of doctor I might see? She said maybe I could do a colonoscopy but since none of the tests showed my colon backed up or anything she doesn't think it will help.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPlease, help.",

Before my appointment I had around abouts 32oz water, a banana and on my way to the appointment I had a can of Monster Energy Drink.  \n\nThey didn't tell me that I was going to have to have a blood test so it wasn't a fasting blood test whatsoever, also - I feel as though the last nights activities as well as being dehydrated may factor....but, I guess my question is....those AST/ALT numbers aren't good....right?

I\u2019m 22, male, 6\u20194, and on the high side of average BMI. I am lanky and awkward. \n\nNOTE: There have been two weeks in the last month or two where the tension/pain mostly stopped. I went on a road trip, and it mostly went away then except for sometimes while I was driving. Last week it also went away for a bit\u2014after my massage, I was starting to get stiff again, put tried tucking my shoulder blades back and that seemed to work. Kept with that until now, where it\u2019s no longer working.",

        "About 2 years ago after work, I suddenly felt a burning sensation in my calves just under the right side of my knees. Seemed like some sort of shin splints. I went to the doctor and he said that It was a little tendonitis and sent me on my way. It progressively got worse. The pain felt like it was slowly agitating all of the muscles in my legs. My patellas felt imflammed and them my wholes calves were on fire. Nothing could stop it unless I wasn't wearing shoes. I have a shop job so I would always wear boots before this started.  1.5 years of absolute hell and agony of walking, I tried on hoka's bondi and it alleviates most of the pain from a 9 to 1. I have no idea whats wrong and Ive been to several doctors and they've tried PT, nerve tests, and nothing. Now they look at me like im making it all up. What should I do?

        "Hi. I am going through preparation for bariatric surgery. \n\nI am 36F, live in Michigan. I got labs taken in mid-May. The results showed total iron of 57 ug/dL; total iron binding capacity of 306 ug/dL and iron saturation of 19%. These labs were fasting, possibly due to other labs I had at the time.\n\nBecause the latter was low, I was asked to go on iron supplements. So since about the week after that, at the nutritionist's request, I have been taking 60mg ferrous fumarate. The capsules also contain 60 mg vitamin C. I take these separate from items containing calcium. \n\nI got re-checked today and the results popped up. Today's labs were NOT fasting, but my iron levels have DROPPED. What the heck? (Admittedly, I am on an extremely low calorie mostly protein shake diet in prep for surgery right now - it started last Tuesday. I am still taking supplements.)\n\nToday's results are total iron of 36 ug/dL, total iron binding capacity of 293 ug/dL and iron saturation of 12%.\n\nWhat on Earth happened?

I\u2019ve also had muscle cramps all week, like Charlie horses.\n\nToday I was sitting in lecture when I felt a strong pulse in my neck. It felt like it was bulging out.

        "30, male, 6\u20191, 310, Black American, struggling with this issues for a little over a year!\n\nSo, I have two issues that I believe are connected but I just don\u2019t know what to make of it. For a little over a year, I\u2019ve been having to strain to have a normal bowel moment. Sometimes a lot comes out and other times it\u2019s little pebble shapes but there is always straining. I also tend to have to strain to pass gas and sometimes there is this build up of pressure in my rectum area that\u2019s so intense I feel like I\u2019m going to pass out.\n\nThe second thing is my actual digestion. Whenever I eat food, I tend to get full rather quickly and it seems like my food will sit in my upper stomach for a little and then slowly moves down my digestive track. I even get full of liquids and have had to stop drinking anything carbonated because of the bloating it would cause.\n\nI went to an urgent care and they tested my blood and said that i tested positive for something that tends to cause slow digestion. They have me 2 antibiotics and something called omeprazole. Even after the course of taking the medicine, nothing got better.\n\nNothing will my health has changed. Except that over the course of the last 3 years, I\u2019ve lost over 200lbs but I\u2019m not sure how that could affect my digestion and bowel movements.\n\nEdit: I do have an appointment in with gastroenterologist but that\u2019s a month away.",

I have no serious medical conditions or history of vision issues at all.  I was at dinner with my brother earlier tonight and suddenly my vision in my left eye started to go dark. It seemed to start in my upper field of vision and then settled into the lower field of vision. The lower half of my left eye field of vision was essentially blind for about 10 minutes, and then it came back. It's almost 10pm on a Friday night. I want to make an eye doctor appointment, but I'm unsure how urgent of a health issue this may be. Seems like everything is back to normal now, but I would appreciate any insight into this issue, and if it merits an ER visit?  Looking at WebMD has me worried...\n\nEdit:  Not sure if this is also relevant, but I had just finished playing ice hockey and my team was short handed, so I skated my ass off tonight.

        "Hello doctors, I'll start with yesterday! \n\nIt was a mellow day. The only physical activity I did was walk to the nearby gas station for a soda (10 min walk), something of which I do all the time (4/5 times a week). I woke up at around 10am and mostly just played video games/watched Netflix all day, again something of which I do most definitely all the time (Any time I'm away from work basically, I know sad). Around 5pm I just got a wave of sleepy tiredness over me and decided after one or two more episodes of Netflix I'd go to sleep. This has happened before a few times, even after no physical activity, but never where I sleep for 24 hours. I didn't set an alarm though, because I had both yesterday and today off from work.\n\nRight before I went to sleep at around 7pm, my mom knocked on the door and asked if I wanted any chicken she had made... I said yes I'll be right there, but then I guess I fell asleep, because it felt like 5 seconds later I got a knock on my door waking me up and again asking if I wanted some dinner. I didn't know an entire day had past, so when I walked out to see that the chicken was now salads I was a bit confused... I didn't say anything though, because the time was still correct (a little after 7pm), and I though maybe we'd eat salads and the chicken was coming a bit later? after about an hour, I said are we having chicken? My mom gave me a strange look and was like \"Oh we have some left overs in the fridge. I can get some for you!\"\n\nIt's now been an hour and a half after I woke up and I realized I slept for literally and almost exactly 24 hours.... Is something wrong?",

        "Female, 22, 5\u20192, 115lbs\n\nSix months ago, out of no where, my right arm began to feel hot and swollen (like your finger when you wrap a sting around it). When I lifted the arm I could actually feel the blood leaving and coldness would slowly migrate from my fingers to my shoulder. After that day, I had chronic pain that went from the right half of my neck to my shoulder radiating into my back and chest. A couple months later my GP did an ultrasound of my arms and diagnosed me with Vascular Thoracic Outlet Syndrome (TOS) in both arms. The arterial flow in my arms when resting at my side was  L 15mm and R 12mm, however, in any other position (raised, in front, behind, or even neck turned) the aterial flow was L 0mm and R 1-2mm. My symptoms however did not stop at my arms. \n\nMy legs feel exactly like my arms do. I\u2019ve always had feet that got too hot or too cold with blotchy appearance but now that sensation is every where and the blotchiness has begun to spread to my thighs. I have noticed many new spider veins in my calves, thighs and arms. Sometimes my feet swell to twice the size and other times they\u2019re white with sunken veins and I stop being able to move my toes. My pinkies have severely lost range of motion. The pain in my back has migrated to my lower Lombard and the numbness in my neck has reached my face. I feel that my cognitive abilities have also declined (slower speech, inability to focus, generally feeling of haziness).  Occasionally I get cramps or sharp/dull pains in my legs, usually on the left side of my left calf. Sometimes the pain will move to a different part of the extremity like the knee. The cramping is always accompanied by weakness in the extremity and circulation disruptions. \n\nI feel faint all the time. I\u2019ll be sitting down and feel a wave of weakness and disorientation. I\u2019ll be doing nothing and my heart will start racing, sometimes over 140bpm (EKG showed short pr intervals with sinus arrhythmia?). I also have shortness of breath, as if I just can\u2019t fill my lungs fully. \n\nAdditional information that may or may not be relevant: slightly swollen painless lymph nodes for a few months, persistent low grade fever, right eye vision blurred frequently, constant headaches, stomach bloating, and occasionally horrible stomach pain right below the sternum. \n\nA doctor (TOS specialist) has recently suggested that I may have a herniated disc causing all these issues, however, I want a second opinion with a doctor who is not a TOS specialist. Is there a specific doctor I should see? Or any ideas as to what this could be?",

I drink and smoke weed but the rashes started long before. I actually don\u2019t know if they\u2019re rashes, I have been to several doctors and an allergy specialist. All bloodwork and allergy tests came back with no results and the doctors gave me a different diagnosis every time. I stopped trying, I haven\u2019t had bloodwork done in a couple years.\n\nIt comes in flares, usually for a 1-2 weeks every month or two. Likely just coincidental but I\u2019m quite often on my period when it flares. I went nearly a year without a flare up but it came back a month ago and hasn\u2019t stopped.\n\nThey are most often on my arms, legs and head. When it\u2019s on my fingers it is EXTREMELY itchy and painful - aloe vera soothes it temporarily. The bumps last for around 8-12 hours.\n\nDuring a flare, the bumps often grow where there is a lot of pressure on my skin. After a day of wearing tight jeans, my hip/pelvis area is covered in little bumps. I can\u2019t pluck my eyebrows without my whole eyelid swelling up. Otherwise it just happens wherever it feels like it. My moles can get quite itchy too. Sometimes the bump just hangs out for a while, other times my whole body part will swell, usually my lips, tongue or hand (pictured). There\u2019s generally always some on my scalp too, I itch like i have lice and i\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s weirding out my coworkers. \n\nI was on the deprovera shot until Jan 2019, otherwise no medication. I sometimes take 2 benadryl at night when my fingers are particularly swollen, otherwise i\u2019ll scratch until i\u2019m bleeding and not sleep a wink. \n\nAny help would be greatly appreciated. It\u2019s painful, unsightly, and so frustrating to have no idea what it is. Thank you.",

Some iodine, a pinch of Lidocaine and he'll make the necessary incision. Ok, let's  do it. He squirts a bit of iodine on the wound. I tell him that hurts. I mean, this thing is angry.

When I was released on the 18th, the hospital sent me home with the same Amox/Clav 875-125. I finished the rest of my original bottle and took some out of my new bottle to ensure I took a full 10 days straight. I went back to the hospital yesterday for pain but this time in my appendix area. A scan determined all was well but I still had active diverticulitis (although it was mentioned it had improved on scans when comparing to a couple weeks ago). They released me from the hospital with two antibiotics- 500mg of Flagyl twice a day as well as 500mg of Metronidazole twice a day. \n\nIs this safe to do? I feel like this is way to many antibiotics in a very short amount of time.

        "I am 33 years old, Caucasian, 5\u20190 tall 138 lbs. I currently take doctor prescribed testosterone 1ml every two weeks due to low T and have been for about 2 1/2 years now. I live in central Florida.\n\nAbout a month and a half ago I realized I had an itchy \u201cscab\u201d right on the front of my shin. I scratched it a lot and it oozed a little bit and bled a little bit. Eventually started to heal up but then scabbed over again and just wouldn\u2019t seem to heal up. I started covering it with bandaids every day and putting either Neosporin on it or Vaseline.\n\nIt just didn\u2019t seem like it was healing up very fast and continued to be itchy unless it was covered. If air, water or sun hit it... it would get itchy. so I went to a dermatologist and she said she wasn\u2019t worried about skin cancer but that it may be a bite or something having trouble fully healing. She said to just keep putting Vaseline on it. I did that but the actual size of it got a little bigger... and the redness in it actually became \u201cbumpy.\u201d\n\nI went back to the dermatologist and she again ruled out the idea of skin cancer but said it did look like it was becoming larger and more irritated: she gave me samples of a lotion/steroid to put on it for two weeks to try and help it heal and I have another appointment with her in two weeks. She advised me not to do a biopsy of it just yet. I can\u2019t stop worrying about this damn thing. Any ideas? Since I\u2019ve been using the steroid lotion, the itching has went away... but the size/color of the thing is still there. It doesn\u2019t seem as bumpy, but it\u2019s still there. I\u2019ve been on the steroid cream now for 3 days and by the looks of it, it\u2019s still not going away.\n\nAttached is a picture, sorry for quality and the shine over it is because I applied the steroid lotion to it a few hours ago.\n\nhttps://m.imgur.com/rCUuJ88\n\nYour insight is greatly appreciated!",

        "I never really thought I had ADHD as a child. I always had an active imagination and would be thinking about 20 different things in my classes. I could never focus on studying and would try to read my textbooks, but I would last maybe five minutes and end up drawing in my notebook or even start staring at my wall. I've always been very absent minded and would break things or mess things up, because I wanted pay attention to what anyone was telling me. My parents would just label me to be a \"goof ball\". So, growing up I'm just like \"hey, everything is boring and complicated! I'm just a goof ball. No big deal\". \n\nIn college I got a little better, but man it is a struggle. If I didn't study I would fail my classes (because I can never focus in class) so I have to like force myself to read my notes or textbooks. It's almost like something is physically pulling my brain away from the pages. Meanwhile, I'm almost building up this anxiety inside of my body because I'm not moving around and doing a bunch of random shit. Currently, I should be writing something for a class but instead I'm writing this and it's mostly because I can't stay motivated/focused. I can't even focus on someone talking to me one on one. Someone can tell me a whole sentence about them and I will zone out and think about something else. This really sucks, because people would think I don't like them, but really I'm just not present. It happens socially, with my professors, and even job interviews. It's not really because I'm not interested, but because my attention just can't stick to one thing. I also tap my foot a lot, crack my knuckles, and shuffle around in a chair and the weird thing is when I do these things I'm thinking about that rather than my professor who's five feet in front of me. \n\nI'm just a little scared to start medication as people in my life are very reliant on medication and it has always bothered me. The reason I never got evaluated was that my parents told me they don't want me to be like them, so mental illness or disabilities never truly existed in my family. SO, naturally I'm a bit nervous about talking to anyone about this. But, damn after writing this out I think I should speak to a doctor. \n\nSo, does this sound like ADHD or is there something else going on?",

I didn\u2019t do anything particular to it that I can remember, it just started hurting one day and hasn\u2019t stopped since. The location of the pain is mostly in the last two toes, directly below them, and down the outside of my foot. I\u2019m not sure where the pain truly originates, but if I had to guess I\u2019d say it\u2019s at the base of one or two of the toes. \n\nI was recently made aware that this could be a stress fracture. I\u2019ve ordered an orthopedic boot that should be here tomorrow and I\u2019m trying not to walk on it excessively. Luckily, I work from home, so I\u2019ve been able to limit my walking to just doing the things I need to do around the house for the past 2-3 days. The problem is that I was walking around on this potentially fractured foot for well over a month, so I\u2019m afraid it might be too little too late. \n\nGoing to a doctor is not an option. I\u2019ve read that stress fractures usually heal on their own with rest. My question is what is the likelihood this will still heal on its own after having been neglected for so long? Will I have permanent damage to my foot now since I can\u2019t go to the doctor?\n\nI can\u2019t find any real info online since all the treatment advice boils down to stabilizing the foot until you can get to the doctor, which isn\u2019t applicable to me in any way. \n\nThanks in advance!",

I'm not on any medication.\n\nSo basically I've gotten these really painful lumps on the side of my outer labia (the side closer to my legs, the outside). I've gotten 3 in the past 3 or 4 months, but I remember getting some when I first started going through puberty, when I was 13 or 14.\n\nThey kind of seem like big, painful pimples. The area above and below them kind of gets hard, and once they \"pop\", if I press on the hard area, this gooey stuff comes out. It's pretty thick. It doesn't soak into toilet paper really, just kind of sits there.  It's kinda yellowish-whitish-greenish, and opaque. That's what two out of the three I remember have been like.\n\nThe other one is the one that I'm kind of worried about. It kind of had that weird ooze, plus quite a bit of blood. Not a concerning amount, just more than the others. It kind of grew skin and a lump. I don't know how to describe it. Kind of feels like a canker sore, but not in my mouth. The skin on it feels quite thin, but I don't want to touch it because it really hurts. And it's still bleeding, although not much. I don't really want to include a picture because I can't get a pic of it without getting my vagina and I'm not comfortable posting that, so I'm sorry. I hope I described it well.\n\nBy the way, I'm not sexually active and I never have been. I'm not sure if that's relevant but I figured I'd include it.\n\nAlso, my period ended Thursday. It started Monday, and these things showed up on Tuesday or Wednesday. Just in case that's relevant.\n\nBasically I just want to know if these are normal, and if not, what to do about them. I'm just worried because the one hurts basically whenever I move my leg in a certain way because it gets rubbed.",

        "Hello! It\u2019s my first time posting here with a question, so hopefully I can give enough information.\n\nI\u2019m a 30 year old male in relatively good health. Recently I was in Las Vegas on a business trip and I went out with a coworker to drink and have fun. I had been drinking a bit every night there as well. On this night, I ended up blacking out and being robbed. My coworker lost sight of me and I disappeared. I went to the emergency room in the morning at my company\u2019s request and the doctor ran a blood test, but I don\u2019t think the staff actually knew why I was there in the first place. He let me go and said you have a stomachache. (Mild Gastritis?) I went to the police and just tried to move on.\n\nThe problem is, it\u2019s almost a week later and I\u2019m still feeling nauseous and dizzy, most of all after I eat anything. I\u2019ve never had symptoms like this come from drinking. The police and security suggested somebody may have slipped something in my drink at the bar. The doctor didn\u2019t mention anything on the blood test though. So my main concern is, could the hospital have overlooked something? Or possibly not have known to look out for it in the first place?\n\nI took my eyes off my drinks several times at the bar. There were a lot of people there. I don\u2019t know if someone put something in, I can\u2019t remember anything past about 2 am.\n\nShould I go see someone? It would be out of my system by this point though if I even was drugged. \n\nAnyway, sorry for the incoherent jumble, I\u2019m not good at typing things out on my phone. Just wondering if anyone had any insight into this problem. Any help is appreciated! Thank you!",

So i recently have done a tilt test that my professor referred me to. Currently, i suffer from an unknown heart and bp weird functionality(sorry im NAD so idk medical terms all medical terms im using are written in my tilt test report) and the doc that was there diagnosed me with vasovagal syncope. Which i think is a strange diagnosis but not surprising considering he had no prior knowledge of my medical history.\n\n\nSo basically what happened was as soon as the nurse put me in an upright position my feet turned blue and both my heart rate and bp spiked. HR on 140 bp on 153.. After 2 mins both of those stats dropped and stabilized to 120 bp and 60 hr. After 15 mins of being upright, my blood pressure had a sudden drop to 75 and kept dropping as well as my heart rate dropping to 54 bpm and kept dropping. I felt sick before those sudden changes and my vision went blurry. The nurse had to stop the test at that point. When lowering the bed again my heart had a sudden spike to 100bpm and blood pressure again to 150. \n\n\n(Important notice ) i have been on beta-blockers for the past year now bisoprolol to be exact.

All my friends and family know I urinate alot and will commonly make comments and it's most been a joke my entire life. \"Really man? You already have to go again?\" I hear this constantly\n\nI also feel when I drink alot of sugar it comes out more fast. (Soda vs water ect...)\n\nAlso it would be good to note I drink alot of coffee (which I hear can help with diabetes or low blood sugar).\n\n\nI already have gone to the doctors. They did the first one (after I fasted for 8 hours) by drawing blood and doing a urine sample. They told me to come back in again because they got bad results the first one and wanted to do a second. After the second test they tell me as is fine no more tests required. Im also going to mention on the day of the second test I did drink coffee at 4:00 am and had the appointment at 5:00 pm.\n\nOne more symptom I have is shaky hands, but this could be from the coffee I drink every day.

But I only really have one symptom- I often feel like I have to pee when I definitely don\u2019t have to and I get no relief from going to the bathroom. I have no trouble controlling my bladder, meaning no leakage or trouble emptying. I just feel like I have to go all day every day. \n\nI\u2019ve tried five different medications and physical therapy. They seemed to work for a time, but then there would be weeks where it felt like they did nothing and then it would go away again and things would be normal. It seemed like I\u2019d have flare ups that lasted for several weeks. The physical therapy just exacerbated the problem. \n\nWhat I eat and drink doesn\u2019t seem to affect the problem, with the exception of caffeine/carbonated drinks, but even that isn\u2019t consistent. It also seems to worsen if I make a small pee and get better if I have a big one.\n\nI\u2019ve asked my docs whether I could possibly have MS since it seems to flare like an autoimmune disease and since I have no other symptoms, but they said in the absence of other symptoms it probably isn\u2019t. But they never asked me about other symptoms.\n\nI\u2019ve looked them up (I know the internet makes everyone think they\u2019re sick but I want to be sure) and I do have some. I have minor muscle spasms in my legs regularly, lots of twitching, and blurred vision in one eye. At first we\u2019d thought the blurred vision was a side effect of the oxybutinin I was on, but it continued when I switched to myrbetriq.\n\nI just want to know if I should insist on getting tested for MS or not. I know it\u2019s difficult to test for but if there\u2019s any significant possibility I want to be sure. Otherwise, I\u2019d love to be assured that I just have bad OAB.",

The friend he was with said that my brother told her \"I have a brain freeze\" and then he made some type of humming noise and proceeded to fall over on his left side right out of his chair. The friend said he was passed out for about 5 seconds. My brother said when he started to remember things he was already standing up but didnt remember how he got there. The friend said he did not his head but his glasses got bent in the fall and he also has a small scratch behind his ear, so he obviously hit his head during the impact. \n\nMy brother has had bad headaches for the last 8 years.

When he asks for an MRI scan all they do is prescribe him more medicine. \n\nIs there any possible explanation to why this may have happened? What should we ask a doctor to check for this time? What are some things we can change in his daily routine to help out with the headaches?",

It started mid-orgasm Thursday at 4am, sudden, piercing, blinding pain in my right hemisphere. As soon as I could stand again, i took an Imitrex...nothing. Waited 2 hours then did my Fioricet every 4 hours all day Thurs which only made it slightly tolerable. This is abnormal for me, I almost NEVER need more than 2 doses. I tried Benadryl and Gatorade. I tried a multi &amp; B-complex. Friday, diarrhea started and by Friday night I was on the toilet with a bucket. As soon as I vomited, BANG, all at once it felt like something exploded in there &amp; the pain magnified 100x. I cried weakly for a good hour or 2, then husband helped me to bed with yet another Gatorade, a clean bucket, and packed my head in ice. I slept a bit, but am now up at 3:45 am (Saturday now) and it's still really bad. It has not moved location and has been sharp and throbbing in right hemi only.

        "&amp;#x200B;\n\nI injured my face a long time ago as a child, and in turn, my nose was slightly malformed, however, I finally got corrective Rhinoplasty a few weeks ago. But something has been bothering me since the surgery.\n\nSome of my rib cartilage would be needed to extend the nose, ergo, I knew I wouldn't be able to wear a bra during the surgery. When I was walking down to be operated on, the nurse even ensured I wasn't wearing my bra under my hospital gown, on top of any jewelry. I assumed I was allowed to wear my underwear since my nose isn't anywhere near my nethers. The IV was inserted as per usual, and I don't recall anything else being done.\n\nSo I wake up, a little bit fuzzy, and the first thing I notice is that there's a tube up my vagina, so at first, I'm confused, wondering why there's a tube up my vagina, but then the secondary thought is that my underwear was removed. I am wheeled to the recovery room and the nurse casually removes the tube and hands me my underwear in a plastic baggie.\n\nDuring the whole healing process, I wondered what a tube up the vagina could be used for. I wasn't on my period, so it wasn't used to prevent blood leaking, it isn't an IV that gives anesthesia or fluids, or pain killers. I raked my brain and couldn't figure out. I was also upset because no one mentioned that my underwear would be removed, especially, not by me, but while I was under, and it wasn't implicit such as removing my bra so they could cut my rib cartilage, or let's say, a patient with a hernia knowing to remove their underwear for the surgery. I was too awkward to ask what the tube was for.\n\nWhen I got access to internet, I searched up what the tube was for, not really know what I was looking for but keywords were \"Tube, vagina, and rhinoplasty\", I mostly got results for labiaplasty and vaginal reconstruction but couldn't find a results for a tube up the vagina in the case of a Rhinoplasty, or anything besides vaginal reconstruction, actually. Am I being paranoid? Or is there a reason for tubes up the vagina? If it means anything, I was in Korea because of their expertise in Asian faces, and I'm 18.\n\nNot sure if I'm in the right thread but I figured doctors or surgeons would know what the various tubes used during surgery are used for.And not really relevant to the question, more to the thread, but I'm 18, East Asian, 5'5 and anywhere from 110 pounds to 115.\n\nEdit: Surgery lasted no more than 4 hours, a catheter is being suggested but it was in my vagina, not urethra, so I'm not sure. The forums online are saying that catheters are not usually used for rhinoplasty, so now I'm even more confused.",

        "Age 32\n\nSex F\n\nHeight 5'2\n\nWeight 105\n\nRace white\n\nDuration of complaint 15 years +\n\nLocation pelvic / abdominal\n\nAny existing relevant medical issues\nEndometriosis\nPelvic floor dysfunction\nPCOS\nMultiple past rapes / child molestation\n\nCurrent medications ortho-micronor\n\nPost:\nHi. F/32. 5'2, 105lbs.\n\nSeveral past sex partners, clean STD test apart from HPV18. Have had HPV18 for 3-4 years. Keep being told 'oh it will clear by next year' (and honestly I feel like that's horseshit to make me feel better.)\n\nHave: PCOS (elevated testosterone as well but no facial hair/dark thick hair) Endometriosis (EXTREMELY DiSABLINGLY BAD PAIN), Pelvic floor issues (currently in physical therapy) plus other various non-related issues\n\nI have a history of being brushed off and ignored for my pelvic pain. I wasn't taken seriously by my parents in my teens even when I was screaming and unable to walk during menses - they were convinced I was 'doing it for attention' or some such. But that's another kettle of fish.\n\nI confirmed endometriosis in 2012. I was placed on progesterone only birth control and the surgeon's notes were added to my medical file. Six months after my surgery, I explained to my gynecologist that my birth control was insufficient and that I was still vomiting and in pain almost every day.\n\nHe brushed me off and told me I must not be taking it properly even though I explained that I had a phone alarm and I took it exactly the same time every single day -- even though I explained that I had timed it, that I took it at 9:30 a.m. in the morning and by 6:30 a.m. in the morning the following day I was getting horrible cramps, he would not listen to me, continued to tell me to take the birth control, and shooed me out the door.\n\nIn the following years I tried about once a year to get a new gynecologist to listen to me and please put me on something that actually worked. I am so sick of vomiting. I am so sick of horrible cramps and abdominal pain.\n\nI was told by two gynecologist that there was nothing else, and that I just needed to take my birth control.\n\nI was told by one gynecologist that he was unsure and that this 'shouldn't be happening' after surgery because it should have 'got it all' (????? - But isn't endometriosis always growing? Doesn't it grow in the presence of estrogen?)\n\nThe most recent gynecologist put me on a estrogen-progesterone combined pill and demanded that I take it even though I begged him to reconsider. He held my treatment hostage and demanded that I take it so I did. I lost three weeks of my life to that pill. I vomited uncontrollably for days. My abdomen never stopped bubbling.\n\nNow this same gynecologist wants to put me on nexplanon. I am... Hesitant. I feel at this point like most of the gynecologists who have seen me don't actually have the faintest idea what's wrong and are just throwing out whatever suggestion they think will work for the most women that show my symptoms.\n\nI'm just exhausted, and it's 3 a.m. and I'm trying not to puke, and I can't even masturbate these days because the cramps are so severe and the nausea so powerful afterwards.\n\nAnd I just... I just want to know, you know? Will the HPV really clear on its own? Am I really out of options when it comes to the severe pain and loss of function I am living with?\n\nI just... Honestly it feels like the gynos see this as just some \"womanly pain\" that I need to suck it up and deal with. And that makes me want to give up and not even be alive.",

I smoked about a pod every two days in my peak usage (one pod has as much nicotine as a pack of cigarettes) its been about a month since i quit. would it be weird to ask my Doctor for an X-Ray of my chest? or would i just sound like a crazy person?

Now here's the thing, my body did not respond to any of the beta blockers, or heart rate medications they gave me. But finally after about a 16 hour stay one of the nurses was like \"Here's some oxygen\" and hooked me up to the machine. Within about 15 min my heart rate normalize for the first time in 16-18 hours and has STAYED at 70 bpm. I was finally able to get some sleep and my heart rate never woke me up, according to the new shift my heart rate hasn't gone above 74 ever since.   \nNow I'm deathly afraid of AFIB the more I read about it. Uncurable and only treatable, after dealing with it for only a single day... to say I'm miserable is an understatement. It felt like my chest was going to explode constantly. So I'm hoping for a 2nd opinion from other doctors here on reddit.

        "I have been having some unusual symptoms on and off for the past few days. I first noticed this on Wednesday, I was feeling very nauseous for half of the day almost and I tried to just sleep it off but in the middle of the night I couldn\u2019t take it anymore and ran to the bathroom and threw up. While I thought that would alleviate my symptoms, I felt nauseous again the next day! That day I woke up and did NOT vomit but had what I think was diarrhea or watery stool at least. I also have stomach pain along with all of this and to make matters worse it seems like I cannot eat anything without feeling nauseous. I also have been having a lot of acid reflux which I have never really had a problem with before, but lately it has been impossible for me to even sleep properly because of this, because I feel like something is coming up the back of my throat when I lay down I have to keep my head elevated when I sleep. This has been happening for a few days now and it is really starting to worry me. I am also not in the best shape but I have never had any issues with my health before, I am also a smoker (Although I have cut down since I have been sick) and I pretty much eat whatever I want usually because I have never had any issues with that before either. Please HELP!!! I have been suffering with this for almost a week and I am worried now this may be a permanent state for me.",

        "Hello, let me preface this by saying I am worried sick and looking for any input. I did something stupid last night that I will never do again but I fear I may be facing lifelong repercussions for this mistake...\n\nI tried cocaine for the first time last night while drinking with some friends - probably blew 7 or 8 lines with shared bill$ and straws. I am 22 F, about 145 lbs and 5\u20192\u201d, my friends are 21 F, 24 F, 21 M, 21 M, 26 M. We are all white. They do it often and like I said it was my first time. I don\u2019t know the status of anyone there but as far as I could see there was no blood on the shared gear, and I only put the straw/dollar about half way up my nasal cavity. I know these factors may not make a real difference tho.\n\nI am totally freaking out because I didn\u2019t realize until this morning how risky this activity was. If it helps to know, I am asymptomatic, not on any prescription medications and I don\u2019t smoke cigarettes. \n\nDo you think there\u2019s a high chance I may have came in contact with this virus last night? \n\nAnything helps. Please let me know what you think.",

        "I\u2019m constantly tired. I usually have to drink more than 3 cups of coffee each day just to stay awake. I fall asleep before 9 because I can\u2019t stay awake longer than that and I always get at least 8 hours of sleep. I just never have any energy. I don\u2019t know what the problem is. When I wake up I\u2019m tired, I feel tired during the day, and I have to go to sleep really early because I literally can\u2019t stay awake late. If I don\u2019t drink caffeine, I usually fall asleep at around 2 pm. I\u2019m 5\u20191\u201d, an 18 year old girl, and around 125 lbs. Is there an explanation for this? Why am I always so tired?",

        "So yesterday around 3:30 am I had heart attack like symptoms. Posted here but deleted it since I wasn't taking the chance and went into the ER. After about 9 hours I was diagnosed with AFIB when they saw my heart rate literally jumping from 80 to 180 then back again over and over for about a 12 hour period.   \nThis is the first time in my life I've ever had this issue, I'm 32 years old. Now here's the thing, my body did not respond to any of the beta blockers, or heart rate medications they gave me. But finally after about a 16 hour stay one of the nurses was like \"Here's some oxygen\" and hooked me up to the machine. Within about 15 min my heart rate normalize for the first time in 16-18 hours and has STAYED at 70 bpm. I was finally able to get some sleep and my heart rate never woke me up, according to the new shift my heart rate hasn't gone above 74 ever since.   \nNow I'm deathly afraid of AFIB the more I read about it. Uncurable and only treatable, after dealing with it for only a single day... to say I'm miserable is an understatement. It felt like my chest was going to explode constantly. So I'm hoping for a 2nd opinion from other doctors here on reddit. Given the fact that the moment I got oxygen and its been over 16 hours without another episode and none of the other medications worked, is AFIB really the only diagnosis? Is this really my life now?",

        "22, female, Caucasian, 180, 5\u20196, duration: around 3 months.\n\n\nSo I suddenly noticed that after I pee I still feel like I have to use the restroom and the flow is a lot weaker than it used to be. I find myself going all the time too, even when I drink less. I even wake up a few times a night to use the restroom. It always feels like I have to go right then but there\u2019s never a lot in there to warrant the need. \n\n\nI don\u2019t have a UTI and I don\u2019t think I have diabetes. \n\n\nI can\u2019t see a doctor for five months because of a waiting list but I just want to know what this could be.",

What could be the cause? I'm worried bc it's just so random. Last week I woke up with my nose feeling swollen too. \n\nAlso there was a mosquito in my room last night. Could that be the cause? Never had a mosquito bite the lip before. The lip isn't itchy at all though. When mosquitos bite me it's usually extremely itchy on the skin so I'm not sure if it's that.",
