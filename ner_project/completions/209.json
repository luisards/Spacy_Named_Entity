My body feels like it\u2019s pulsating and I feel like I\u2019m on a boat, it can pass quickly or last for a while. My heart isn\u2019t beating any faster and I\u2019m not anxious at the time. I\u2019ve also been extremely warm, waking up with night sweats and not being able to stay cool even when it\u2019s cold outside and I\u2019m not being active. \nAny ideas?"
