    "reddit": "I know this is totally random as it happened four years ago...My boyfriend (M, 24)  just called me (F, 25) about an exertion headache he got from working out and I started thinking about the incident four years ago that involved so much pain that I still remember it. I was doing a leg press, really exerting myself when I literally heard a pop in my head and then a sharp, burning localized pain in my head. I immediately stopped my work out and grabbed my head, holding it tightly because it hurt so badly. I left the gym but I remember feeling like dizzy and losing a little bit of my hearing and then sitting in my car until I felt okay enough to drive home. That pain lasted a few more hours. What could that have been? I\u2019ve never experienced pain so badly in my life and I suffer from chronic migraines and no migraine ever hurt that much.\n\nOther things to note: non-smoker, never done drugs, binge drink one night every 2 months, no health conditions except sciatica and chronic migraines. Average weight."
