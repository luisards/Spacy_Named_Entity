    "reddit": "Age: 26\nHeight &amp; weight: 5 foot 5, 220 lbs\nRace: Caucasian\nDuration of complaint: About 1 week\nGeographic location: Central Florida\nLocation on body: Eyes/head\nMedication list: Fluoxetine, Abilify, Lamotrigine (for bipolar disorder and OCD)\nOther potentially relevant info: I wear glasses and use marijuana\n\nMy chief complaint is that my eyes... feel slow? If I look out the corner of my eye on the right side and then to the left, it takes a moment for my vision and my head to feel clear and normal again. I don't have the vocabulary to describe exactly what is different but it is frustrating and interferes with reading and driving.\n\nDriving has become a bit scary for me. I have been prone to lightheadedness if I turn my head too fast (like normal speed) or look in another direction. The lightheadedness goes away after a few seconds, thankfully.\n\nSometimes this lightheaded feeling is triggered by things like yawning. Movement can do it, but usually if I say, bounce around while sitting down, I feel fine. Turning my head in the car, though? No fun.\n\nFinally, my brain just generally feels foggy lately. I feel like this is related but could be wrong.\n \nThanks for reading, I am happy to provide more information if needed.\n\nUpdate: spouse dragged me to urgent care. My vision has gotten worse and I need new glasses. Doc said that could resolve the issue, it might be something transient. But if I experienced any pain or severe dizziness to go to the ER, and to get someone to order a CAT scan if the issue didn't go away in a week or so."
