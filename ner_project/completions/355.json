    "reddit": "For the second time in the last month, my wife has had lightheadedness, nausea, slight headache, and overall feeling of weakness. Last time this happened, symptoms subsided in about a week. This also happened once during February of this year - same symptoms but with a worse headache - which she ended up going to the ER twice, getting IV pain meds for headache and nausea, but it still had to run its one week course before she felt better.\n\nWe are at a loss as to how to navigate this. Her symptoms are all very generic. She's been seen by 7 different doctors ranging from ER physicians, family med, Physician's assistant. None seem to have any answers nor have suggestions of what to do next.\n\nAll blood tests normal, not pregnant\n\nMRI/MRV all normal\n\nHealth 26 year old female with no major medical issues. 5'4, 130lb.\n\nOnly medication she takes consistently is birth control daily. We're suspicious of her birth control so she's stopped taking it a few days ago. We've made an appointment with a Gynecologist next week.\n\nPrevious ER physician suspected an odd type of migraine. Appointment with neurologist in October.\n\nAnyone have any suggestions of what's going on? Can these symptoms of lightheadeness, nausea, overall feeling of weakness, slight headache be attributed to anything else?\n\nWould be much appreciated. Thank you in advance."
