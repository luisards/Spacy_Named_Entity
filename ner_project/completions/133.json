    "reddit": "I\u2019m a 22 year old female with CF. I\u2019ve never had the stomach flu before but have it currently (haven\u2019t seen a doctor though). I can tell it\u2019s not my usual Cystic Fibrosis type of sickness. I\u2019ve been having diarrhea, throwing up, and feel really weak and tired. \n\nI have a prescription for metonia for nausea... could I take this to help with this stomach flu/sickness? Or should I take nothing? \n\nThanks in advance"
