Pain is in in my left side of abdomen.\n* Any existing relevant medical issues : Anxiety?\n* Current medications : None\n\nI've had a cramping / pulling pain in my left side for probably 7-8 years. Sometimes it is worse than others. It seems physical activity may make it worse. I had a physical once for a job orientation, which makes me shy away from it being a hernia. It will hurt worse monetarily if I lay down flat. It feels like a strong stretching / cramping."
