However there is this particular spot about 2.5cm to the bottom-left of my navel where it feels completely soft, and I can sort of poke without any resistance. I noticed this about a year ago but did not take any action. But now I am concerned if this some sort of hernia or some other possibly bad thing, and I would like to get some advice."
