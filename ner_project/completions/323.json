    "reddit": "I've had recurring chest pains since about January. It feels deep and up high, where I know my heart is. It's usually a more of a burning achey sensation, but sometimes it comes on stronger and more sharp. I had an exercise stress test and ECG in February, all clear. Had a follow up ECG about a month and a half ago and it was all clear. \n\nAbout a month ago I started getting recurring pains in my left arm. It tends to be more in the forearm and intermittent, coming and going in different areas, sometimes up more in the shoulder. It doesn't always coincide with the chest pains, but often does. \n\nAbout two weeks ago I had a particularly bad episode of the pains so I went to the ER. They did an ECG, full blood work and a chest XRay. The doctor I saw after all the tests said my heart looked good and healthy, as far as he could tell from the tests. \n\nMy question is: With all of these recent tests coming up clear, should I still be at all worried about my heart? My greatest fear and the source of my anxiety is dropping dead or dying in my sleep from something that I could have gotten help for. I don't want to keep bugging my doctor about it if I don't need to, so I thought I'd ask here for advice on whether or not I should still be worried.\n\nThanks so much in advance! \n\nAge - 33\nSex - Male\nHeight - 5' 8\"\nWeight - 145 lbs\nRace - Caucassion\nDuration of complaint - Ongoing\nLocation (Geographic and on body) - Canada\nAny existing relevant medical issues (if any) - history of mild acid reflux and anxiety. \nCurrent medications (if any) \nInclude a photo if relevant (skin condition for example)"
