I figured it might\u2019ve just been water or something so I went about my day and didn\u2019t think much about it. The next day I woke up I noticed it again. Maybe even more so than the morning prior. Over the last three days I\u2019ve experienced hearing loss in my right year. ETN doc prescribed the meds listed above saying she thinks it\u2019s a viral thing. I had no fluid in my ear and no blockage, thus no reason for hearing loss. We discovered I have auditory processing disorder and that my left ear is very good (-5,~10) and my right ear is on the low end of normal (15-25) but is notably shittier than my left. To the point where I\u2019m misjudging sounds I would normally be fine with. Bad in particular was at 25 (minimum score for \u201cnormal hearing.\u201d Any higher any it\u2019s considered hearing loss. \n\nThis is where it gets a little more interesting. I have had shortness of breath. Constantly yawning and feeling like I can\u2019t catch my breath. I thought this was an anxiety related thing because it started two weeks ago while I was on vacation with my now fianc\u00e9. I proposed well on that vacation so I figured it was my body\u2018s response to being nervous and full of anxiety. I didn\u2019t think much of it but she pointed out yesterday that I was still yawning and not able to catch my breath. I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m struggling to get oxygen or like I\u2019m smothering but I know you Yawn When your body needs to breathe and get more oxygen which is mildly concerning. I decided to Google it out of curiosity and of course the Internet says I\u2019m dying so I thought I\u2019d come here and ask for anybody on here to give their thoughts.\n\nThinking about it now on my way to work today on my way to work I got super tired out of no where. Maybe I didn\u2019t get a good nights sleep and just got tired during my hour and a half drive but I was struggling to keep my eyes open. Once again it could be nothing? I know when you look hard enough for anything you can will it into existence lol\n\nThank you for reading and for any advice you may leave. Feel free to ask questions."
