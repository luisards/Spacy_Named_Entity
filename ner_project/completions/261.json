I\u2019ve been dealing with palpitations for over three years now, the kind where my heart feels like it flutters or skips a beat. They used to scare me a lot, but I\u2019m pretty used to them now.\n\nSince about a year now, in times of high stress, I\u2019ve had episodes of repetitive \u201cskip a beat\u201d palpitations. This is on the order of one skipped beat per 5-60 seconds. These episodes last anywhere from 6 hours to over a day. The only symptoms I have are slight dizziness.\n\nI\u2019ve had recent EKGs and Echos, where there\u2019s nothing wrong. Ive even had a weeklong Holter monitor where they diagnosed PVTs and PACs. \n\nI\u2019ve been to a hospital for a similar episode, and they seemed unconcerned. I\u2019m pretty unconcerned myself.\n\nMy question here is, at what point do I have to worry about this? I\u2019m going through a similar episode now, symptoms as above. It\u2019s been going on for about a day and a half now, with some relief around when I went to sleep. However, I woke up a few times with these palpitations and managed to fall back asleep. Palpitations seem more frequent after I eat or drink anything. If this is going to be a more common thing, do I have to be worried about any other effects that might come with an improperly beating heart?\n\n**TLDR**: Repetitive \u201cskipping beat\u201d palpitations happening with one skip per 5-60 seconds lasting for many hours. Have a clear bill of health. At what point do I have to worry about these episodes?\n\nEdit: Formatting"
