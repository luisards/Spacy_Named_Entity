I've had the [bumps](https://imgur.com/a/OOLW9mM) on my genitals since mid-March 2019, but it was only a few back then. The number of bumps has since increased.\n\nRecently [this](https://imgur.com/a/OOLW9mM) wart has appeared above my eyebrow. It appeared very quick - over the course of two days. To me it looks like a Filiform wart, which is caused by HPV I've read. And to make things worse, I just read that touching a Filiform wart can possibly spread it to other parts of the body..."
