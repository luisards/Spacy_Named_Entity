    "reddit": "Probably a dumb question. \n\n29F, 5\u20192ish, 176, mixed Caucasian/black, symptoms have been around forever but worsened after a bad reaction to fluoxetine two weeks ago. I HAVE been eating very poorly since that bout and am now on my period. Symptoms remain and include: Shortness of breath, nausea, alternating bowel movement issues, reflux, intermittent bloating, intermittent heart palpitations, fatigue, shakiness, weakness, frequent urination (small spurts). No drugs or medication, non-smoker. History of anxiety disorders. \n\nI went to the hospital yesterday with the above complaints. I have had issues with bloating and constipation my whole life - IBS. On my periods, I get relentless diarrhea. I have suspected endo or fibroids for a few years due to period intensity but have yet to be diagnosed. \n\nI did a heart test (not sure what it was called :( sticky things were stuck to my ankles, chest and arms), did a urine test and a blood test. They were looking specifically for anemia and hypothyroid issues but the doctor, kind as he was, cryptically said he was going to check for other things. I was too anxious to remember to ask what he requested. \n\nEverything came back clean and he told me all symptoms were anxiety-related. \n\nI\u2019m just curious - would Cancer show up in any of these tests? Or would I have had to request specific bloodwork? If so, what can I request? This is something I stress about daily. \n\nThanks for any help.\n\nEDIT: forgot to mention that he did mention my white blood cell count was slightly higher than usual, but was nothing he was concerned about. Apart from my current persistent symptoms, I feel ok. Not feverish or anything."
