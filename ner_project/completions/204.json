Planning to leave it in for at least 6 based on the newer recommendations in European countries I\u2019ve seen. So I don\u2019t think it is failing or has failed. I started having irregular periods last year, in November they switched to regular for months. This month I am 10 days late, and instead of a period I am having some pretty intense discharge. Not odorous, not burning, etc. Just milky white. TMI but a lot of it..Could this be a yeast infection or BV even with no discomfort? \n\nNo other symptoms except moodiness"
