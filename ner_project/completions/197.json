    "reddit": "I'm now using furabid/nitrofurantoin antibiotics for a bladder infection, this is the 3rd day, i take twice a day ( 100 mg each ) for 5 days. Besides the common side effects like itches and headaches i also discovered mild bleeding after a toilet visit, but i just had my period one week ago and it looks different it really is blood and it has a heavy irony smell ( sorry for the gross details ). Is or can this be a furabid side effect ? I've had many antibiotics over the last few years, most because of sinus infections but i never felt so bad like i do now. Its just a nasty med in my honest opinion. I can guarantee that this isn't my period since i already had mine last week and this is not something i normally have or deal with.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAge : 30\n\nSex : female\n\nHeight : 5'4\n\nWeight : 130lb\n\nRace: white\n\nDuration of complaint: less than 24 hours/noticed today\n\nCurrent medication: Furabid 2x 100 mg.
