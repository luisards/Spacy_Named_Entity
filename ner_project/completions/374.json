I've never had any previous health issues, except for some broken bones and some sicknesses. I've visited a dermatologist twice, and my GP, who've just prescribed me various steroid creams and antifungals with no effect. \n\n\nThe issue started back at the beginning of this year, I began getting these little cuts/sores out of no where on my hands (like at the base of my thumb joint in picture 4) which would never heal, and would develop into these flat red rashes that look like they have little  \"bumps\" inside them. They don't itch or hurt ever, they just get a little dry, and never seem to improve. I have similar, less severe, spots on the top of my feet. They all seem to be located on some sort of joint. \n\n\nIn addition to the skin symptoms, I've had this severe feeling of just being \"off\" since the skin issues began happening. I've had terrible anxiety, which has never been an issue, and I have a constant feeling of passing out almost all the time I'm awake. The severity of the issues tends to fluctuate throughout the day, and tends to be the worst in the afternoon.\n\n\nI'm going back into my dermatologist for a biopsy in a month, but honestly it seems like they have no idea what to do, and I was hoping the good people of Reddit could at least point me in the right direction or give me some sort of idea on whats going on with my body. I appreciate any help or guidance!"
