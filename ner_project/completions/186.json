    "reddit": "* 24\n* Male\n* 190cm\n* 90kg\n* Caucasian\n* Unsure of how long it's been there, I noticed it today and removed all the hair to get a better look.\n* No medical issues or medications\n* Never smoked or done drugs\n* Alcohol consumption equates to no more than one bottle of wine per week\n* Not sexually active, last incident was over a year ago but I have been checked several times since then and all have come back clean.\n* Main medical conditions that potentially run in my family are diabetes, high blood pressure and breast cancer.\n* Recent vaccinations are for HPV in June, and Hep B(?) in July.\n\nPhoto is censored about as much a possible, but wouldn't recommend opening in a public place.\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/EWtyh9u](https://imgur.com/a/EWtyh9u)\n\nThere are by my count 4 patches of discolouration of various size on the patch of skin above my genitalia. They do not hurt to touch, and I cannot find any of these on different parts of my body.\n\nThe only thing that springs to mind is I had a fairly nasty bug bite on the 3rd of August, but that was on my lower thigh and has since pretty much healed.\n\nHappy to provide any more information."
