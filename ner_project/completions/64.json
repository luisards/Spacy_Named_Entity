    "reddit": "26 yo male\n170 cm \n70 kg\n\nWhen I'm laying on my back, suck my stomach inside and press on my lower left abdomen, right next to the hip bone, i feel this hard mass/ lump, which feels like it has a long shape. On the right side I feel nothing...\n\nI must mention that I'm dealing with hard stool for a few years. Maybe it's a stool build up but afger having a bowel movement today I still feel the mass. \n\nI feel pelvic pressure and tension almost every morning. \n\nAround a year ago a urologist told me I have very mild inguinal hernia that is no big deal if I don't have symptoms. Is this the hernia? I feel like it's located more on the colon. \n\nI don't feel pain when I put pressure on it.\n\nThanks for your help."
