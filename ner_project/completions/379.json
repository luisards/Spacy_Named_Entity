This knowledge was pretty redundant but oh well.\n\nHe hasn't cleaned his grill in a while, I assume, because he was cooking his hamburgers and there was smoke everywhere. You could see the smoke and you could smell it, though it wasn't a very strong smell or anything. Nevertheless, the smoke was still pretty concentrated in the garage even though the big garage door was open and it was going outside.\n\nHe beckoned me to come inside and said it wouldn't hurt me, so for some reason I just did. For most of the time, I had my shirt over my nose. Halfway through his 1-3 minute presentation, I just went outside because I couldn't handle the smoke. He told me he used to cook his hamburgers outside, but put the grill back inside the (detached) garage for the winter and just never took it back out. He said from the future he would cook outside now.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor close to a year now, I've had some bad health anxiety and I always get anxious about things like this. That morning, I played tennis for an hour or a little more. I've had some trouble sleeping recently, I went to bed at around 10 or a little after, and then woke up pretty early at 7 which is unusual for me. I had a little headache throughout the day, though I don't think I had it during tennis and it felt like it may have occurred after the grill incident? I do spend too much time on the computer so that may have been the source of my headache, maybe. The headache was pretty noticeable when I was in the car going somewhere because we had to hurry, and I was a little stressed beforehand since I was dawdling a little.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHas this affected me brain in any way or just my lungs, am I alright? I've always been a little low energy, but I don't know if that's got anything to do with the smoke. Thanks!\n\nP.S. We use a propane grill, if that makes a difference. Thanks for reading, I appreciate it!"
