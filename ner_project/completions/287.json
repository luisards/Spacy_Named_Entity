It was a very sunden onset whereby my sympathetic nervous system would over-react over the smallest situations and cause panic. \n* Differential diagnosis provided was panic disorder/generalized anxiety. \n* Doctor prescribed Clonazepam &amp; Escitalopram. \n* Currently only taking 10mg/day Escitalopram. \n* Anxiety has now completely subsided, however, this physical sensation remains. \n* Note the sensations begun BEFORE starting Escitalopram. \n* Doctors believes sensation to be psychosomatic. \n* I work an office job and do have bad forward head posture, which I am working to correct. \n\nAny thoughts would be appreciated."
