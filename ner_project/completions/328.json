I've been addicted to it since then and I'm up to a tolerance most of my doctors can't even fathom. I really would like to quit, but I don't know if it \"ruined\" the anxiety fixing part of my brain.\n\n I know H users' bodies stop producing it's own pain killing properties when you start using because the H is doing it for you, but it fixes itself when you stop.\n\nHow about Xanax/benzos though? I started at puberty. I want to quit but I'm terrified my brain is fried and my anxiety will always be pretty un-manageable. I'm not a doctor so I'm not too sure how it works, but... will I ever go back to minimal anxiety if I quit dosing?\n\nI slowly climbed from 1mg @ 14 yrs to 30-50mg @ 23. I want to ween off and try to get a life. What damage did I do to myself permanently if any?"
