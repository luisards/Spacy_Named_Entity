Now, it seems that every time I hit my head (even slightly like getting a basketball to the head or standing up and hitting the ceiling) I feel like I have an instant concussion again . I\u2019m so tired of this and I\u2019m attending a festival tomorrow and won\u2019t be drinking in fear that I\u2019ll destroy my brain for life (I hit my head 2 weeks ago I got a volleyball to the head and stood into celeing very hard). My symptoms are dizziness, sensitive to light, not feeling myself, nausea, and blurry vision. I\u2019m also a hypochondriac so it\u2019s tough to say but basically do you guys think I generally have a concussion? Or is it all anxiety? Should I enjoy my time with my friends this weekend and have some drinks?"
