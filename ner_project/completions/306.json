You know what? Nevermind. I guess I should've known better. If the question revolves around catching diseases from a toilet seat or eating fruit you all just dog pile in, but when someone is legitimately scared you won't touch it with 10-foot-pole.*\n\n*Are you guys just a bunch of posers or something? I guess you're the same as every other lazy karma-whore on Reddit. If it's more than 2 paragraphs long it requires too much of your precious time and you just don't bother. How pathetic.*\n\n*Whatever, I'm out. This sub is a joke and a massive waste of time.*\n\n*Do you have any idea what it took for me to post this? Wait, that's right. I should assume none of you read a word I wrote.*\n\n\n\n\nBefore I get called an idiot, I'd like to explain why I came here first. \n\nEver since I was young I've had that feeling that there's something wrong with my body. I know there's others out there like me. Every time I followed a potential clue it led to nothing. The doctors just do the basic tests, but don't go beyond it when those tests are negative. Which is fair. Advanced testing gets expensive pretty quick. \n\nWhen I was young I was diagnosed with some mood and anxiety disorders. I'm always the first to agree that my mind is powerful enough to create pain out of nothing. I've gotten good at telling the difference. But I find it unlikely that my mind is causing all my problems. It's just too much, and some of the symptoms are complex. \n\nStill, a lot of the time my symptoms are downplayed or even just written off as nothing. My age also works against me. I keep getting told that I'm too young to be sick. But my family history and the experiences of others confirm that while it's unlikely, it's not impossible. Some babies develop cancer before they're born. \n\nOne of my biggest fears is getting cancer. There's a lot of cancer in my family, and I meet risk factors for the types we know about. A lot of my relatives died young, so they could've had cancer too, and we just never knew about it. But I hesitate to bring up the C Word with my docs because sometimes it does more damage than good. \n\nMy vigilance and awareness plays against me. I learned a long time ago that if I talk with my doctor about every little thing that concerns me they might start seeing me as a hypochondriac and nothing else. Maybe I am a hypochondriac, I don't know.\n\nSo I've become selective. I fight back the anxiety, give it some time, and see what happens. And that's why I've come here. I've given it time, but I've never had anything like this happen before, so it's hard for me to tell if this is something serious. \n\nAlmost 2 months ago I noticed what I thought was a rash on my left breast. But it doesn't behave like a rash. It's not itchy or painful, the skin isn't rough or flaky, and cleansing the area doesn't affect it at all. They just look like discolored pock marks or something. \n\nThey cover about 35% of my left breast. I thought my right breast was clear, but a week ago I felt a tiny pinch of pain and used my finger to rub it. I came across a small lump. But I didn't think it was anything to worry about. I thought it might just be a lymph node.\n\nI'm on the antibiotics because of an unrelated infection that got out of control. I only take antibiotics in extreme situations. This is the first time I've had them in 10 years. They've been very effective, the infection that caused me to go on them is almost completely gone. \n\nBut now I'm getting worried because the stuff on my breasts hasn't changed at all. I'm almost done with the antibiotics, I only have a few doses left. If it were bacterial, like I thought, it should be gone by now. \n\nIt's not itchy or painful, I don't apply any creams or cosmetics anywhere, the only thing I use is lotion, but I don't use it on my chest. I sleep naked and don't wear a lot of clothes when I'm home (which is where I spend the majority of my time), so I doubt it's from fabric. Plus if it was something like that you'd think it would change over time. \n\nI can't think of anything that could set a reaction off. But I'm hoping I'm missing something. I'm not an expert, after all. \n\nWith my left breast it started as a few spots, then expanded to its current state over 3 days. It's been like that ever since. I'm assuming the lump on my right breast has been there the whole time and I just didn't notice it. \n\nThe lump is hard, oblong, and about the size of a large grain of rice. It's close to the surface and doesn't move. Messing with it doesn't cause any pain. \n\nSo. Should I schedule a mammogram? Or should I try an antifungal cream or something first? I just got a new doctor, so I'd like to keep my hysterics to a minimum. I don't want to scare them off so soon. And I hate mammograms, too. My breasts are so small it's almost impossible to get them between the glass. \n\nOh, one last thing. I have no clue if it could have anything to do with this, but since there's skin involved I should point out that I meet almost all of the risk factors for melanoma. \n\nSome of my moles have been getting a little squirrely lately, too, but I've held off on getting them checked out because of what I talked about earlier. But I should point out that one of the moles I've been keeping an eye on sits right between my breasts. \n\nI've also been suffering from severe digestive issues for the past few years. Again, I don't know if it's related. But it has caused me to lose a lot of weight, and I can't gain it back no matter how hard I try. My bra size went from a 34B to a 32A (which is a very difficult size to find, by the way). My ideal weight is 115. I haven't been able to get above 100 for more than a year. It doesn't sound like much, but for someone my height it makes a huge difference. It's an obvious and visible difference. \n\nI started tracking it, and it's definitely not food-related. It's completely unpredictable. Cutting out preservatives and additives helped a bit, but it's still a big problem. I'm showing signs of malnutrition and malabsorption. It's gotten to the point where I'm actually afraid to eat, especially if I'm on a road trip or in a situation where I can't lie down or run to a bathroom if it hits. \n\nI don't know. There's a strong possibility that I'm overreacting. I'm the same age my mom was when she was diagnosed with cervical cancer. I know that one isn't genetic, but our childhoods were very similar, and she had to have a partial hysterectomy at 32. Like I said, people in my family get hit young. She was only 57 when she died, and by our standards that's actually pretty good."
