    "reddit": "I am a 24 year old female. Mixed, black and white. Smoker (well, vape), drink regularly, not the healthiest lifestyle. 5\u201d5\u2019 and 120 pounds. No history of heart conditions in my family and no pre-existing conditions. Not on any medications but quit birth control about 2 months ago after being on it for 10 years. \n\nI started getting weird heart palpitations last night, like a fluttering feeling and this sensation in my throat. I am used to the feeling as I have pretty severe anxiety, but typically it will go away within an hour max. But I woke up today and still had it, and have felt it until now (6:30 pm). \n\nNo other symptoms, except that it\u2019s triggering major anxiety. I read that my vape may be a cause and also saw that PMS (which I\u2019m def going through right now) can cause it for whatever reason. Since I quit birth control my PMS has been hell so I feel like maybe that\u2019s a possibility. \n\nI\u2019ve never had continuous heart palpitations like this. I have extreme health anxiety so I am freaking out.\n\nI\u2019m also in an unfortunate position where I\u2019ll be w/o insurance for a bit due to changing jobs. So I really want to avoid the doctor if I can. But I also don\u2019t want to risk anything if it could be something serious.\n\nThanks in advance!"
