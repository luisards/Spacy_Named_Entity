    "reddit": "This is a question on the doctor I saw today as part of a shared care model clinic when I asked for birth control today. I have more detail on the specifics of the visit but I don't want the post to be too long. \n\nBackground: \nAge: 27 \nSex: female \nHealth: fine generally but have a thyroid problem, which is medicated. \n\nI was told today that because I had a migraine once, I shouldn't have birth control pills. And that I must have a pap (cool) and a transvaginal exam (I've never heard of that) before getting an IUD. I'm uncomfortable with the idea of IUD but willing to educate myself. \n\nMy questions are these:\n1. Is a migraine 5 years ago evidence that I shouldn't be on the pill? \n2. Is a stroke a big danger of birth control pills? \n3. Is a transvaginal exam necessary before an IUD can be prescribed and inserted? \n4. Do Kyleena IUD's actually take your period away for 5 years? \n\n(5. Please let me know if there is a better place for this - I couldn't find a gynecologist community.)\n\nThanks in advance for your insights."
