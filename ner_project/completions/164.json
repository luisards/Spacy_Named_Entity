I could speak fluently in my language at 2 years old. At 5 I was fluent in English, I could read and write in English and my home language. I was able to do algebra and I was fascinated with history and science. The school always wanted to let me skip grades because I understood all the work and was often bored in class ,but my parents didn't let me skip any grades. I did really really well in academics all throughout school. After school I wasn't able to go to university due to financial issues so I started working full time at a bank and paid for college myself. I studied computer engineering and graduated top of my class (I got full marks on all my papers).   \n\nThis slowly changed. At the age of maybe 21 or 22 I started getting \"slow\". I struggled to learn new concepts and often asked for clarification on things. I'm 28 now and I don't know anymore. I can't even follow the most basic of instructions without feeling confused. I forgot everything I learned. I used to be really good at programming and maths, now I can't even solve basic word math problems.  \n\nAround the age I started getting \"dumb\" I was in an abusive relationship for about 6 years. The guy often insulted me and made me feel worthless and stupid. I've also been diagnosed with a mood disorder when I was 20 and I'm still struggling with it. I'm not sure if any of that contributed to this and that it's all psychological.  Or I just peaked at a young age and this is my life now . \n\nAny input would be appreciated. I'm still working up the courage to go see a doctor about this one day."
