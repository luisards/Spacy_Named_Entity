    "reddit": "I am currently on birth control, tri-cyclen lo. I don\u2019t take the sugar pills, I just continue on to the next packet however this is the first time I got a very heavy period for longer than 14 days. I had to change my pads every 3-5 hours. I\u2019ve been on birth control for over a year, what is going on? Will this go away, is this an emergency? Is there an underlying cause? I didn\u2019t miss any days of taking the pill either. I have pcos and before birth control I didn\u2019t get periods at all. But after birth con when I would go on the sugar pills every 3 months or so later I\u2019d get a period but this time it came in very heavy, still hasn\u2019t stopped. It came on August 8th and now it\u2019s been more than 2 weeks. The heaviness has calmed down. But I\u2019m still bleeding. \n\nI am a 5\u20192\u201d tall 21 year old, non-smoking or vaping south Asian woman and weigh 95kgs.\nList of meds:\nVyvanse 40mg for adhd and eating disorder \nSeratratine 150mg for anxiety and depression \nTri-cyclen lo 28, for pcos and acanthosis nigricans"
