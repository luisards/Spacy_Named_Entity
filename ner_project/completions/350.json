    "reddit": "* Age = 19 \n* Sex = Female\n* Height = I'm pretty short. Around 4'10-4'11\n* Weight = 90lbs\n* Race = Asian\n* Duration of complaint = Like maybe 2 months ago, but I only started worrying about it a few weeks back\n* Location (Geographic and on body) = Body weight? idk\n* Any existing relevant medical issues (if any) = None\n* Current medications (if any) = None\n\nI am a very small person, yes. And I can't recall my exact weight prior, but I remember briefly it was around the 105-110 area before. These couple months I've been getting a lot of comments about my weight. All my relatives comment on how skinny I've became, even the ones who I visit often, notice a change. I went from that to 90lbs and now I am stuck at this weight. Like the bar literally sits at 90, maybe barely passing it to 91 or 92 (I've checked from time to time for a few weeks now). I didn't even think it was a concern until everybody kept pointing my weight out. It's a concern because I've literally had not done anything to intentionally lose these weight. I keep to my old routines and do what I usually do.\n\nThe only thing I could think of that could cause this is, my college campus is quite huge and I walk from class to class a lot on a daily basis (last year was my first year of College), also I have not drank soda for like a month or two, but I don't know if any of these reason is a real cause. My mom thinks it's because I'm in my room too much and I barely go out -\\_\\_- tells me I have never had any serious illness before so I should not worry. She did scheduled a doctor appointment when I asked her to, though. But that appointment won't be until a couple weeks as it's packed. Yes, I'm seeing a doctor anyways, but I do want some thoughts from you guys, because this is giving me anxiety (I guess for the meantime until I do see a doctor). And yes I have been stressing a lot lately, and my anxiety pops out from time to time. Take note, I've never been one who gains weight easily. I eat a lot, I mean eat a lot... and I've never gotten fatter than my weights before. I've always been the same no matter how much I eat. I guess this one, I was just surprised that I lost weight so suddenly without trying. Any thoughts?"
