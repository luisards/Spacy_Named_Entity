    "reddit": "Hello,\n\nI am an early 20's male living in the middle of the US. I have never seen a psychiatrist before. The last few weeks i have been getting worse and worse with feelings of anxiety/paranoia and depression. As an example of what i am dealing with, last night i didn't go to sleep until about 6am (i usually go to sleep 12-2am) because i kept thinking i was dying from a heart attack (I wasn't). In my town the soonest i can see a psychiatrist is 7 weeks (I've checked everywhere except the ER) and i am not sure i can deal with this for that long. I do not want to hospitalized, i just want some type of medication to make it better.\n\nCan i go to an ER, see a psychiatrist, not be hospitalized, and given medication that day?\n\nEDIT: I have been to a GP and they said they could not give me medication because they were worried about the complexity of my symptoms. They wanted me to see a professional about it.\n\nThank you."
