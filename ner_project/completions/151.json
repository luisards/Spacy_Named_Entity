It would make my stomach hurt all day and I just felt off and had on and off headaches throughout the day. That\u2019s why I stopped taking it. Do you think I should start taking it again? Any recommendations on pills or ways to get it into my system?\n\nI\u2019m currently taking doxycycline for acne along with some topicals just to let you know some other medicine just in case it could interfere with that \n\nAlso what does vitamin d do for me and why is it important?"
