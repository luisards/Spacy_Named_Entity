    "reddit": "A couple of months ago I got this red circular patch of itchy skin on my neck (around the Adam's apple region). It seemed like dry skin, so I put lotion on it, and I tried to get it to go away. Not only did it grow bigger, but I also developed a large spot on the front of my chest/collar bone, also red and itchy. Then I got a spot on my right eyelid. My coworker took a look and said, \"That's ringworm,\" so I got some OTC antifungal lotion (Lotrimin) and started treating it. We work in EMS and I've gotten colds and stomach bugs from patients in the past, so it's not super surprising that I could have picked up ringworm from someone at some point. Two days later, I had 3 more spots around the back of my neck, so I went to my local urgent care and said, \"Hey I think this is ringworm.\" The doc said, \"Yeah, gross, here's some prescription cream (Clotrimazole/Betamethasone Diproprionate USP).\" So I started using that, and the 'ringworm' stopped spreading, but every time it's faded/almost gone, it flares back up again. Now, as of about three days ago, they're getting bigger and more painful. The one on my eye is growing constantly, and it's painful, now. Every morning I wake up and my upper eyelid is swollen halfway shut until I put a cool compress on it.\n\nAnyone have any ideas as to what this could be? Is it just super resistant ringworm? Is it some horrible disease? I'm not sexually active so it shouldn't be anything in that realm. I haven't been sick recently, no travel outside Pennsylvania. I don't do anything particularly weird. I do own rats, but my rats have not shown any sort of signs of ringworm (it's zoonotic) or any other illness. Please let me know if you guys have seen anything like this before.
