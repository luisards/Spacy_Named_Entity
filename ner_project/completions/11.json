Only take Wellbutrin and effexor and have been on them for a while for depression. \n\nI got home from a day out and about at the mall and a friends. When I went to go untie my shoes I noticed on both my lower legs (primarily on the inner side, and only a few on the upper feet) red dots all over. Hundreds of them. Don\u2019t have any discomfort really but there is a lot of them. Trying to identify what they may be. \n\n[rash](https://imgur.com/a/hwnZl9N)"
