    "reddit": "Age: 18 Sex: Female Height:5\u201910 Race: Mixed race. \n\nI got my first migraine when I was 13. At first they were only once every few days, but eventually I was getting them every day,  which put me into the category of them being chronic. Sometimes I would get multiple a day. I had my blood pressure checked out, bloodwork done and nothing came out of it. I gave up on finding out what it was and just took an Advil when I got one and hoped it would go away. When I was about 15 they slowed down a bit, instead of getting them every day I\u2019d get one every three days or so. But then just before my 16th birthday they picked up again. I went to the doctor and got my blood pressure checked, bloodwork done, cholesterol, sodium levels, etc checked. Everything was normal. They gave me something a bit heavier than Advil (I cant remember the name of it now) that helped for a bit, but then stopped working. I\u2019ve really given up on finding out the cause of my migraines now, I\u2019m frustrated because I\u2019ve been suffering for almost 6 years, and I\u2019m starting post secondary soon. These migraines have caused me to miss multiple days of school in junior high/high school, and I don\u2019t wanna miss time while I\u2019m taking a degree. What could possibly be the cause? Or is it something that I just have to deal with?"
