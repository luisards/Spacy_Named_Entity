    "reddit": "22, asian-hispanic, 250lbs\n\nso i had a series of flu's going on and off, then had something similar to migraine(never had one before) after all of those happened I had this mild pains that crawls along my intestines, sometimes I feel my intestine move. Before when I used to overeat, whenever I burped, water or food I ate came up. I never experienced heartburn though and I feel a little pain on my sternum whenever I move, breath or when I press on it. Also I had this odd chronic cough that shows up every now and then. I don't feel weak, I haven't lost my appetite other than these symptoms I feel quite fine. its just making me insane since I hate it when the cough acts up. I went to a doctor before for the cough, he gave me PPI and antibiotics had a X-ray that was all clear from lungs, heart and bones. Should I go for a different doctor that specializes on bowel movements instead? please tell me your thoughts. I wouldn't want any surgery done on my body, I have changed my lifestyle too, I haven't overeat for awhile and been losing some pounds im at 244lbs now."
