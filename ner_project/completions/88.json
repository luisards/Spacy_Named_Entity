    "reddit": "Hello, so\n\nI'm 17, a female, 167cm and 75kg (not really fat tho, more like a mix of fat and muscles), I don't know what I should say for race so uh, human, european, spanish swiss, idk. Its been 8 years since I haven't had a temperature above 37\u00b0C, even though I have a pretty weak health. I go boxing once a week (for 2 years now) and do some sports everyday to lose some fat since 3 weeks. I have effort asthma, so I don't really have any endurance for running or swimming and walking up stairs, but I can still do some sports and some cardio so I can say I stay in shape. \n\nI sometimes take my temperature when I'm feeling okay, and it often goes around 35\u00b0C, which is a bit cold I think, I'm not 100% sure.\n\nI just wanted to see if you guys had an opinion about that, if I should worry or not, talk about it with my generalist and such. \n\nI'd add that it's not that I haven't been sick at all in 8 years, like I said, I have a slightly weaker than normal immune system. I've had whooping cough 4-5 years ago, I've had a 5cm kyst on my ovary in february, I've had a ton of flues and cold and such small illnesses. Everytime, I didn't have any fever, it's just that I felt bad to the point of going to the doctors, and after some tests they  found out what was going on.\n\nI don't know if I can say more so here I go."
