    "reddit": "Male, 27, 6'3\", 220lbs, white, don't smoke or drugs or drink, currently taking Eliquis (for blood clots), Welbutrin (depression) and Buspar (anxiety), idk what all info you need for this haha\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo this is really random and sounds silly, but it's founded in legit issues. I read a thing today talking about the Cremasteric Reflex, where you stroke the inner thigh and the testicle raises. I thought it was interesting so I read up on it, but I can't get it to work. So then I was reading about the absence of it, and it has some possible causes, like nerve damages and multiple sclerosis and stuff.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI specifically wondered about the MS and nerve damage because in April 2018 I quite rapidly developed clinical depression and shortly after orthostatic hypotension, so I am lightheaded every time I stand up and/or walk. I have done a ton of tests for the lightheadedness (and the depression isn't a super surprise, I've been mildly depressed my whole life), and all they've found is that I do indeed have othostatic hypotension, but haven't found a cause. I have an appointment with a neurologist September 30th and will bring it up then, but I was curious what y'all thought.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIs it common for men (especially around my age) to not be able to get the reflex to work? Am I doing it wrong? Is it just minute and I don't see it, was I expecting too much?"
