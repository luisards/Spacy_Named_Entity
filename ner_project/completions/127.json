So around tuesday i felt i stepped into something in our kitchen (it's like a part of a fruit, like apple or something like that). There was a little blood but no too much and the wound is very-very little. But i'm afraid to get tetanus or something. AFAIK i got 4 tetanus shot in my life (3 mandatory vaccine (last when i was around 12) and one \"booster\" when i got shot at age 9 ( https://i.imgur.com/dxN50QH.png ).\n\nPictures about the \"injury\" and the thing i stepped into:\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/DsOsUKQ\n\nFeel free to laugh about my case, but it's not so easy if you are that hypochondriac like me.\n\nI think its a very minor injury but please calm me down! :D"
