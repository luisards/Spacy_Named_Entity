  "data": {
    "reddit": "I\u2019m 17, male, 5\u201910, and about 110 pounds. I\u2019ve had anxiety to some extent for pretty much most of life, and I started having panic attacks sometime this summer and was finally formally diagnosed GAD as well as panic disorder. I was also prescribed 5mg of Lexapro. My health is a major contributor to anxiety for me. Lately it\u2019s been my heart that\u2019s been my biggest worry. Despite the fact that about a month and a half ago my doctor told me my heart was in good shape and I had great blood pressure, I\u2019m still worried. Part of this worry comes from the fact that in rare cases, Lexapro can apparently cause irregular heart rhythms. Sometimes when I get anxious, I\u2019ll get chest pains that are generally localized in certain areas. I know this is probably anxiety, but it\u2019s still scares the hell out of me and makes me more anxious in turn. I also noticed that my resting heart rate is 53-63, which I know is slightly below the threshold of normal for athletes. Is all this normal?"
