There has been a small hard bump on the tendon there for a long time that you can\u2019t see unless you really dig around and feel for. However, right above it this larger lump has formed. I noticed it about a month ago. I think the two are unrelated, but the large lump feels like there is air and then if you push down a lot I can feel a hard lump on the muscle. It wasn\u2019t painful until about a week ago and the pain seems to be getting worse.  It\u2019s not movable. I also can not contract my left calf muscle as much as my right one since this has appeared. Sometimes I feel a burning sensation on that leg but I think that is just my anxiety focusing on it and worrying about it.\n\nI scheduled an appointment with a general internal medicine doctor, but I am not sure if I should schedule an appointment with a dermatologist or orthopedic doctor instead.  Thank you for any advice.\n\n[picture](https://imgur.com/PV5ju0O)\n\n[picture 2](https://imgur.com/qXGSwYz)"
