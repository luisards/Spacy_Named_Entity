Once I orgasmed, it got worse. After about 15-20 mins, it subsided. Last time I had a migraine while masturbating was maybe back in 5th grade. Hasn't happened since. I masturbate about once a day, and I got a migraine every time this past week. I took a break and didn't do it Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, but I still got a migraine Tuesday, Thursday, yesterday and today. Please help, as this never happens. I eat healthy, I drink a lot of water and I exercise, so I can't possibly understand why this is happening."
