    "reddit": "Age: 22\nHeight: 6' \nWeight: ~300 lbs\nSex: Male\nRace: White\n\nOn Friday morning, around 4 AM, my body temp dropped to about 95.5 degrees. I was up all night because I work 3-10 PM most days and I was smoking a lot of weed (I've been a regular smoker for years). Since that incident, I haven't smoked at all, but my body temp won't really get above 97.5. I've read it could be a thyroid problem (my mom had some issues with this, but different things) or diabetes (no history I know of in my family). \n\nIs there anything else that could be causing this? I don't have insurance and I don't have a lot of money."
