Started suddenly and last night after a few hours it spread to behind my left ear as well. It throbs and is tender to touch.\n  I have a history of migraines but they are typically above my eyes. This is an entirely new type of pain. It started while I was wearing my reading glasses Friday evening. If you\u2019re familiar with that pain that comes from wearing glasses for a long time, that\u2019s kind of what it feels like but more intense. I haven\u2019t worn them since."
