One of the nostrils is slightly closed most of the times, but it's very easy to ignore the entire thing because I don't get any headaches or become stuffy and don't require any tissues. When i do have a slight flu, my nose is quite runny but when it cures its back to its normal manageable state. It's been 7 years like this and I'm too careless to bother. What do i have?"
