    "reddit": "Age: 26\nSex: Female\nHeight: 5\u201d8\nWeight: 171lbs\nRace: White\nDuration of complaint: On and off for around 7 months or more. \nLocation: England || bladder\nExisting medical issues: Severe depression and anxiety, not currently on any medication. \n\nQuite a few months ago around the beginning of this year I got what I thought was a UTI, the first time I\u2019ve ever had one. There was no pain or burning sensation when I pee\u2019d, I just couldn\u2019t fully empty my bladder and my urine had an odd odour. Stupidly I thought it would just go away on its own and since I wasn\u2019t in pain, I didn\u2019t bother going to the doctor. Eventually it did stop after a week. \n\nBut then about a month later or so it came back and it was really frustrating and uncomfortable to constantly feel the urge to pee, so I did go to a doctor but because it\u2019s the first time going to the doctor with this kind of thing, I didn\u2019t know I needed to take a sample first before the appointment and instead of being understanding, my doctor made me feel stupid and embarrassed. So I left and didn\u2019t feel like going back at all. \n\nNow months later, after this issue constantly going away for a month or more then coming back for a few weeks, I\u2019m concerned and incredibly frustrated. Is this a recurring UTI due to it not being treated the first time? Or could it be another medical issue?\n\nThe symptoms are always the same, there\u2019s no pain and no burning sensation. I just can\u2019t empty my bladder and have a very short interrupted stream, sometimes my urine will have a weird \u201csmokey\u201d odour. I also constantly feel like I need to pee, even after I\u2019ve just gone. I\u2019m definitely planning on going back to the doctor but it can take a month to wait for an appointment at my surgery."
