    "reddit": "Age: 22 \n\nSex: Female \n\nWeight: 130 lbs \n\nHeight: 5 2 \n\nRace: white \n\nPrimary complaint: my hearing seems to be getting worse. Over the last year I have had to start using subtitles more and more. It stared on just Netflix and tv shows every once in a while. Now it\u2019s YouTube and every show or movie I watch. \n\nI can\u2019t hear if more than one person is talking in a room or there is music too loud. It just sounds like a gumbled mess. On the phone I have to really concentrate to understand sometimes as even on the loudest setting where my mom can hear across the room, I still can\u2019t hear. \n\nI used to listen to loud music as a kid, but I don\u2019t anymore. I don\u2019t go to concerts or anything like that so I don\u2019t know why this is happening. \n\nI do have fibromyalgia, arthritis, asthma, chronic gastritis, migraines and syringomyelia (all diagnosed by medial professionals). \n\nI currently take these medications: \n\n1. Topiramate 100 mg \n2. Venlafaxine ER 75 mg (2 pills) \n3. Omeprazole 20 mg (2 pills) \n4. Sprintec TAB \n5. Benedryl (2-3 pills) \n\nI drink sometimes but not a lot and do not smoke. And do no recreational drugs. \n\nThank you in advance"
