    "reddit": "Female, 27 years old, 5'8\", 160 lbs, non smoker, only med currently on is antibiotics\n\n\nIn the last 6 months I have done 4 rounds of antibiotics. 3 for a recurring UTI - first Ampicillin 500mg 2 in morning and 2 in evening for 3 days, then 2 weeks later Cipro 250mg 1 in morning 1 evening for 3 days. Both of those were in February. Then In June I was prescribed Sulfameth/Trimethoprin 800/160mg 1 morning 1 evening for 5 days.  \nNow I am on day 2 of Amoxicillin 875mg 1 morning 1 evening for 7 days for strep throat. \nMy question is how to you help your body heal from that amount of antibiotics? I have a hiatal hernia, GERD, and IBS that are pretty controlled by diet but I have been having a lot of flare ups and gut health issues since being on so many rounds of antibiotics. Will probiotics help? Are there foods or other things I can be doing to help my body build up those good bacteria?"
