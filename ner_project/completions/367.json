    "reddit": "I am a 34 year old female, average 57kg white woman. No kids. No smoker. No major illness, but have hypermobility, Raynauds, seborrheic dermatitis and aquagenic pruritis. I take setraline for depression (taken for 18 years) and a vitamin D supplement. I don't take anything else.\n\nI have been having a curious problem the last 3 years. This actually happens quite rarely. Perhaps 6-10 times a year.\n\nWhat happens is that I wake up in the night, absolutely frozen cold, shivering and feeling \"feverish\" or shock feeling. I have tried taking my temperature but it is normal. I manage to get back to sleep but when I wake up, I find that the bed and myself are dripping with sweat. Normally during the day I sweat very little, even when running so it is very peculiar.\n\nI have not been documenting what could cause these reactions. It could well be hormonal, since it happens rarely. I have not been documenting exactly when. I have also not tried to take my blood sugar. I have been tested for diabetes and auto immune diseases, thyroid etc. I had a very low insulin reading recently but I don't know if it is significant. I tend to have high iron, low vit D, but nothing remarkable. \n\nI have some blood test results too, the most 2 recent are health &amp; lifestyle checks through medichecks, the others were ordered by a doctor.\n\n[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11\\_cyoJpSnxL6A6hs9rB8We9c7HdZiwQx2LCS\\_Tyqr-U/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11_cyoJpSnxL6A6hs9rB8We9c7HdZiwQx2LCS_Tyqr-U/edit?usp=sharing)"
