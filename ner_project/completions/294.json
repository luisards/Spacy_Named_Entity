    "reddit": "Age: 26\n\nSex: Male\n\nHeight: 6'1\"\n\nWeight: 175\n\nRace: Caucasian\n\nDuration: \n\nLocation: Scrotum/Testes\n\nNo known medical issues, not medications, no drugs, no smoking.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHopefully long story short, I think I have one or both of my testicles twisted since I was a teenager (approx 14). I remember the specific day, I was working and had immense pain in my genital area and deep in my gut. I have a high pain tolerance so I gritted my teeth and kept working. The major pain went away by the next day but I could feel a \"knot\" in the tube from my teste. I had a similar experience 1-2 years later in my other teste, though not as severe. I never went to the doctor about it due to embarrassment/anxiety.\n\nI had no problem with masturbating so I never thought it had any long lasting effect. Now on two different occasions over the last 3 years I have had issues where I cannot get erect. My libido has always been lower than my partners but this is different. There is some stress from work and life but I am very into and interested in being intimate but my body doesn't respond. It emotionally hurts my partner and mentally/emotionally hurts me. I literally cannot get hard.\n\nAny advice? Can I just go to a general doctor to look at? What do I say when making the appointment?\n\nSide note: there is also a bump on my scrotum that looks like whitehead zit. About 1/2-inch in diameter. Don't know if that's relevant."
