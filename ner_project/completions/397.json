    "reddit": "Female,17,\n165cm\n75kg\n\n\n\n\nThis issue started few months ago when I was feeling nauseous, dizzy, my heart was beating too fast. I went to bathroom a lot. I thought that I might be pregnant, but tests were negative and I had multiple periods since, so no way I could be.\n\n\nFast forward to May. Nausea, tiredness and blood from rectum. Went to doctor, blood tests were okay, colonosopy found nothing. Surgeon told me I have polyp which I ll have removed this month.\n\nMy rectum often itch, I have soft ,fuzzy, jelly, mucus like stool like everyday. I don't know why. My stomach often hurts and I often feel tired. I sleep 9 hours.\n\nCould this be because of polyp or do I have IBS, infection( or even cancer?)? I eat pretty healthy, vegetable,fruit, fiber supplements. \n\n\nI also have UTI like once in a month for no fucking reason.\n\n\nI would like to hear some of your opinions, because according to Google I have colon cancer, IBS, Celiac disease, hemorrhoids, yeast infection..\n\nEdit: I had lot of stress and anxiety like everyday"
