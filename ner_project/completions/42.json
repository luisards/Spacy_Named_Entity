    "reddit": "I have many medical questions but I just don't want to blurb them here in one thread so I wanted to start with one to see if anyone here has advice.\n\nBackground:\n\n20 yrs old female\n5'3 125-135lbs\nWhite\nDiagnosed with JRA, Chronic Migraines, Supraventricular tachycardia, Mild Scoliosis, collapsed eardrum?(this one is in the middle of being diagnosed so I have no name for it right now)\nFamily history of heart problems, grandma has a pace maker, grandpa died young from a heart attack, dad has high blood pressure, other grandma and other grandpa have both had heart attacks.\nSister has copd, brother had asthma as a kid. \n\nThe issue:\n\nI cannot run. I can try to run, key word is TRY. Just running a very short distance, like shorter than a block, I get this God awful pain. It's usually in my sides like underneath my breasts, the rib area kind of. Not only that I can't breath, like I can but I'm borderline heaving and my throat feels so bad as I try and calm my breathing down. I have had this issue since I was a kid, I can do other exercises but trying to sprint causes such an immense pain I feel like I'm going to throw up. I don't even run that fast and these like episodes happen to me, it's really sad. I currently see a cardiologist but he blows off my worries when I tell him about this."
