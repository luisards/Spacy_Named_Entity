Recently I did this stupidly and I had reddish dots on my penis head for a day or two. They then went away and have been replaced by small bruises for a few weeks (probably coming on a month and a half now). No pain or anything in the penis either. \n\n\nI can't meet my internist until next month so I'm wondering if this is dire or anything (I'm a bit of a hypochondriac). Obviously I'm going to try to masturbate much much more infrequently and when I do I'm never doing that squeeze thing again. I've asked about this online in other places and most people said it should be gone with a cold compress or a few days of no masturbation so I'm starting to get worried..\n\n\nThanks :)\n\nAge 20\n\nSex/Gender: Male, \n\nHeight 5'7\", \n\nWeight: 155lbs, \n\nRace/Ethnicity: Caucasion, \n\nDuration of complaint: a few weeks\n\nLocation: U.S.\n\nAny existing relevant medical issues (if any): no\n\nMedications: Daily allergy med\n\nSymptoms: Obviously the bruise, no pain there accompanying it though. Possibly caused random scrotum pain (but I feel like I've had that for forever) and also tons of anxiety worrying about it \ufffd\ufffd."
