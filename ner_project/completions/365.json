    "reddit": "Hello, I am [23F] i am constantly having diarrhea! I live in the USA, I have not been out of the country. This has been happening for about 3 months. But in the last week it has become worse. Every time I eat something I feel like I have to go right after and I do and it\u2019s explosive each and every time. Sometimes I don\u2019t even eat and I have to go it\u2019s mostly water but I still go. The stomach bubbles and cramps are very bad now. I do have anxiety and have been under a lot of stress lately. I also get very lightheaded and always have this constant ache and bubble in my stomach. It\u2019s just diarrhea no vomiting or nausea. What can this be?"
