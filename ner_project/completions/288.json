    "reddit": "Hello everyone, sorry for the long post but I'm am a 29 year old caucasian female. I am 4'11 and 170lbs. I have two children (14 &amp; 11 years old) that I had at a young age, I got pregnant at 14 with one and 17 with the other.\n\n\nSymptoms include -\n\nVery irregular menstrual cycle (sometimes I have my period every 2 weeks and then I can go months without one).\n\nHarsh periods (when I do have my period, I bleed enough to fill an ultra sized tampon within minutes to an hour and this lasts 2-3 days before starting to slow down).\n\nHorrible cramping during menstruation.\n\nInability to lose weight.\n\nAbnormal hair growth (I have grown very noticeable facial hair as well as hair on my chest and abdomen).\n\nSevere acne.\n\nZero libido.\n\nOften feeling one extreme or anything. Sometimes I feel almost emotionless, I don't care about nothing and have no empathy towards anyone. And other times, I feel too much, I am scared about everything, I get panicky over petty things and I'm very paranoid. \n\n\n\nBack story - In 2012, I was 115lbs, had regular periods. In November I had the birth control Mirena put in and everything seemed fine.\n\n2015 - I stopped getting my period, but started rapidly gaining weight, got horrible acne, noticed slight abnormal hair growth on upper lip. I became very depressed and often irritable. I lost all motivation and ambition for everything and wanted nothing more to lay in bed all day.\n\nApril 2017 - Symptoms got worse. I \"thought\" I knew my problems were from the Mirena and I decided to have it removed. I thought once I got it removed, I would get better. I was wrong. I seemed like I crashed. I got even more depressed but also seemed to have anxiety at the same time. I weighed in 155lbs.\n\nSeptember 2017 - Got my first period after having Mirena removed. Cramping was so bad and the bleeding was so heavy, I felt as though I was having a miscarriage although I wasn't sexual active. I got pale and extremely lightheaded and was exhausted. Could not wear a tampon as I was bleed through them within minutes. Then I didn't have a another period for months.\n\nFebruary 2018 - Second period after having the Mirena removed. Same as last period. But started noticing other symptoms were getting worse, I was gaining more weight, acne got worse, abnormal hair growth got worse.\n\nToday - Nothing has improved. I now have a mustache that I must wax, as well as hair on chest and abdomen that I never had before. My period vary, sometimes still minutes before soaking through an ultra sized tampon and still worse than they ever were before the Mirena and still very irregular. I have gained even more weight, now 170lbs and climbing, despite eating healthy, exercising regularly, etc. I still have acne. I could still lay in bed all day and not think nothing of it, things that use to excite me no longer do.\n\nThe main reason I am here today is because I recently lost my job, due to a misunderstanding about my period. I worked for a property management company, I was maintenance/housekeeping supervisor. Two months ago, I got my first period there after working there for almost 3 months. It was horrible and I called off the first two days because the bleeding and cramping were so bad but I did go in the 3rd day, although it was still really heavy. There were complaints made by other staff members about my bathroom usage and I was accused of only going in to be on my phone, I explained to my boss that was not the case and she seemed to understand. 2 weeks later, I got my period again and it was just as bad as the last time, I went to work despite the incident last time. That day, I was told a perspective tenant wanted to look at a property almost 2 hours away and I had to get out there to clean it asap as they were scheduled to look at it in 3 hours. I said I couldn't do that because I have my period and it's really bad. I got \"Again, already\" and then the 'I think you're lying' look! That was the first time I said no about doing anything that was asked of me. They sent someone else and later that day I was called into the office and let go due to \"obsessive abuse of the break system\" due to frequent using the bathroom during non break times and inability to perform my duties.\n\nI recently started a new job and I'm terrified that the same scenario will play out again. I have explained to my boss my issues and she seems empathetic but we both know work must still get done!\n\nPlease help me figure out what is going on with me! I cannot keep living life like this and I definitely can't afford lose another job! Any help or advice will be greatly appreciated! Thank you!"
