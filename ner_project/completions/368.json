    "reddit": "\nFemale, 30, ~100kg, 174cm, white, Ireland \n\nMedication: Citalopram, recently stopped birth control pill\n\nPartner gave birth 2 years ago. Pregnancy was 7 weeks prem, and she was in and out of hospital throughout pregnancy with prolonged bleeding. Vagina had to be eventually cut as baby was pretty big and couldn't get head past (apologies, don't know the terminology) , stitched up, everything fine there. Baby is totally fine.\n\nAfter, she suffered bad post natal depression, put on weight though she was actively dieting and exercising. Suffered 'period cramps' for the first time and period wasnt regular. Abdominal pain got worse, went for a cervical check and a small growth was burned. (30 min procedure, in and out). Bloods done about a year ago, nothing found. \n\nSince then, depression meds have increased, weight has increased to current level, abdominal pain so bad it's causing her to vomit. Pains occur time to time, without period, and period sometimes doesn't arrive.\n\nGoing for colonoscopy tomorrow but I thought I might put her symptoms down here, see if it rings bells with anyone. I was wondering if it could be something that might be causing all these symptoms. If the depression and weight could be a symptom as well rather than a concurrent affliction, masked by the pregnancy/post natal.\n\nPreviously she did suffer from mild depression (no medication or official diagnosis) and light sensitivity (still extant), needs to wear sunglasses outside all the time. \n\nAny thoughts?"
