I do not smoke, but my girlfriend does and we do live together, although she doesn't smoke in the house and we've been living together for months. I had sensitive skin as a child, but I don't have many problems with it now that I'm an adult. I almost never get skin break outs, I don't even get acne. As a child I also had an abundance of kerotin in my skin (this was maybe 10-15 years ago so I don't remember exactly what it was called, but it was mis diagoned as ecsima for a few years by my pediatrician until I saw a dermatologist), but again, I've had no other skin issues since I was in middle school or younger. can anyone tell me what this rash is or where it came from? I don't have another off day from work until next week, so I just need to know if this is something I need to call out of work to see a doctor for immediately or if it can wait until Tuesday\n\nedit: forgot to add link to picture \n\nhttp://imgur.com/a/23duC00"
