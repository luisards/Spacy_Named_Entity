    "reddit": "Went to the doctors about 3 months ago for numbness/burning sensation in both my heels. She seemed convinced that it must be something in my feet and that because I still had a strong pulse and a good deal of sensation that it wasn't serious. She ran some tests for diabetes and low vitamin counts but said everything was fine.\n\nI drive about 3 hours, two to three times per week so I also considered that it was plantar fasciitis and started massaging and lotioning my feet twice a day.\n\nI then went to a foot doctor who prescribed special arches. I figured it would take a few days or weeks to feel an improvement and gradually I did think they were helping. However, I think the reduction in burning was only because I was losing even more feeling. This morning I ran my finger against both heels and could barely feel it on my foot. I'm making another doctor appointment but I think I really need to push them to test something. I'm not going to wait until I can't feel anything for this to be taken seriously.\n\nI'm kinda convinced that this must be a problem higher up in my nervous system to affect both feet at the exact same time. Any suggestions on what to ask to be tested or done? Also my toes are fine and my hands are fine.\n\nAge: 27\n\nWeight: 280lb\n\nHeight: 6'3\n\ngender: male\n\nother conditions: recently ablated wolff parkinson's white\n\nmedications: propranolol 180mg/day"
