    "reddit": "female, 16, 5\u20197 ft and 136 lbs. i\u2019ve always been very skinny and tall but as i\u2019ve gotten older my boobs, thighs and stomach have all filled out i guess? i sometimes i feel weird because i\u2019ve always been skinny and lanky and i feel strange taking more space than i\u2019m used to, if that makes any sense. i\u2019m worried my weight isn\u2019t healthy for my age, i have no physical health conditions but i\u2019m on medication for anxiety (clonazepam as needed, which isn\u2019t often) and for depression (lexapro once a day and buspirone twice a day) could these medications be making me gain weight? and am i a healthy weight for my age and height? thank you."
