    "reddit": "-27 \n-Male\n-5'11\n-186 Lbs \n-Caucasian\n\n-Noticed it for about 2-3 weeks now, but could have been longer before I noticed. \n\n-Midwest United states. \n\n-Mainly on lower inner legs and a very small amount on forearms.\n\n- I was told my cholesterol was a tad high and that I had high blood pressure recently. I've had anxiety going on for about 2 years now and was prescribed 2 prescriptions of Clonazepam but no refills. That lasted me a little over 2 months and I'll take some xanax only when I need it that a relative gives me. That can sometimes be once a week or even once every two weeks if absolutely necessary. For about 3 weeks now I've started taking Vitamin D pills but forget here and there to take them. \n\nI uploaded 4 photos but had to use my flash so that you can make them out. The ones on my leg are noticeably more visible. They are light brown marks with several pin sized red marks surrounding them.  \n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/adeJpkG\n\nGreatly appreciated for any help that I can receive."
