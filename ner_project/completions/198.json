    "reddit": "Age:22 Sex:F Height: 5'4\" Weight: 180lbs Race: caucasian Medications: propranolol 20mg 2 times per day, trazodone 100mg, abilify 5mg \n\nMy cardiologist found incidental findings on my head MRI. They found 7 lesions scattered in different areas. Some on the frontal lobe, parietal lobe and occipital lobe. In addition to the lesions I have been having tremors (action tremors of hands and arms) as well as headaches (not migraines). I went to the neurologist this week and even though I told her I do not have migraines (I've maybe have one, once a year if that) she dismissed my lesions as migraine related. All she did was give me a perscription of propranolol for my tremors. Should I seek a second opinion or leave it at that?\n\nEdit: she also put me on a beta blocker knowing I have moderate asthma"
