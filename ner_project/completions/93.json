    "reddit": "22, M, 5\u20199\u201d, 160, Caucasian, 6 months, no medication, no drugs, chest/heart, non-smoker. I\u2019ve been having heart palpitations that were reoccurring for the past 6 months or so that have since stopped after a lifestyle change (caffeine &amp; alcohol consumption lessened as well as exercising every day). I went to a cardiologist about these issues and my heart is healthy. The only thing found by a heart monitor is mild junctional rhythm. The thing that keeps bugging me is this weird chest pressure/tightness that I always get if I drink like 2 or more beers the night before. Not sure if this is common but it is one of the biggest causes of anxiety. I used to Juul heavily and have completely quit about 8 months ago. Thanks in advance!"
