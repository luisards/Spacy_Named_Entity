My vision was sort of blurry and shadowy towards the left side. About 5 minutes later I noticed flashing streaks across my vision appear. It lasted about 15-20 minutes, then totally went away. After, I had a bad headache for a few hours. Migraine or something more serious? My eyesight has been perfectly normal since then. I never get migraines so this is totally new to me if it was one."
