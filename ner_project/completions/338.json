I get sad thinking about it, and it happend again recently\n\nSince 2 years ago I was co owining this gaming group and my co owner recently left it and another owner came in and kicked me out and I felt the same feeling, yet not the same pain as last time, but still enough for me to want to cry\n\nIt got better but a year since it first happend I still feel really sad about it and most of the time it\u2019s fine but I\u2019m just really depressed\n\nTwo questions regarding this story\n1) what is this emotion called?\n2) how do I help getting past all this"
