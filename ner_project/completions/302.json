White boy in Canada\nHe was diagnosed at 2.5 years.\n\nWe have a  behaviour intervention team ( 2013- present) and he\u2019s on 27-36 mg of concerta (2015- present) \n\nHis academic abilities are very good for his age but his receptive/ expressive language is pretty delayed unless it\u2019s factual.\n\nHis anxiety has developed when he began school and remains high with or without stimulant medication.\n\nMy BCBA\u2019s &amp; Psychologist are really wanting him on medication for anxiety and we don\u2019t know where to start. \n\nAny advice is helpful!\n\n\nPs\n\nWe have been on a wait list for over a year to see a child psychiatrist but we are continuing to wait :( but our team is looking for ideas to bring to the family doctor temporarily \n\nThank you in advance"
