    "reddit": "19M, 5'10\", 250lbs, Caucasian, afraid of needles, 2 months, taking emgality once a month for chronic migraines.\n\nHi all, I was put on emgality (once monthly subcutaneous auto-injector) about 4 months ago for chronic migraines. Going into it I had no issues with needles and have never been scared of shot in the past. But every month I get more and more freaked out by the shot. I was supposed to take #5 today but couldn't will myself to. Now I have a panic attack every time I have to give myself a shot, and even freak out at other shots  (I had to get a cortisone injection in my ankle and almost vomited from stress). I always get a horrible headache from the anxiety of taking it and dread the day I have to. It's very painful but not horrible and I know this fear is ridiculous, I just can't get over it. Does anyone have recommendations on how I can overcome this annoying fear?"
