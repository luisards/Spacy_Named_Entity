    "reddit": "19M\n\nSymptoms:\n\n* A few years ago, while playing soccer, I'd regularly lie on the ground for a few minutes, gasping for air while feeling significant chest and arm pain.\n* I occasionally/regularly feel shortness of breath/heavy breathing.\n* I tire from exercise rather quickly.\n\nI went to a cardiologist recently, got an ultrasound alongside a stress test done. Both showed good cardiovascular fitness. I followed this with a blood test, which again showed nothing out of the ordinary.\n\nToday I went to a doctor in order to see if the issue was linked to my lungs, and he diagnosed me with mild asthma (despite not finding abnormalities in the breathing test administered - i.e. the diagnosis was based on discussed symptoms).\n\nThis might be my hypochondria talking, though I don't quite feel satisfied with what I've been told by my doctors as of yet. I still don't quite know what could've caused said chest and arm pain. What could the pain have been caused by?"
