    "reddit": "Male, 20. High blood pressure (lisinopril) 5 ft 10 in 180 lb\n\nHi there docs,\n\nIt all started some months back. I was seeing young woman (20)  exclusively for a few months and we had both protected them unprotected sex multiple times. I stopped seeing her after a falling out, and that was it. A few weeks after the last time I saw her, I got very very ill. Symptoms included-  bad sore throat, bad body pain, cough, never had a recorded fever but it felt that way, fatigue as well. Went to the doc, mono suspected, took blood tests. Results: elevated wbc count, 20% reactive lymphocytes, positive monospot. This basically confirms mono right? Well I haven\u2019t been able to shake the idea of having hiv off. I asked her about her sexual testing and she said she tested negative for everything after we saw each other but who knows if she is lying. In the time since then too I\u2019ve had some weird symptoms. One thing worth noting is I had a wart appear on my hand and I had a weird growth appear on my leg while I\u2019ll. I went to the dermatologist for the growth and the biopsy said scar, but it\u2019s still here in a reduced form months later and if I touch it and squeeze it, it reacts and gets worse. For a few weeks I had episodes of stomach growling, a 2 week period of diarrhea basically every time I went, and months later now I have seen hair loss (telegen effluvium expected), beau\u2019s lines on my 2 toenails, sock marks on my legs and my arms feel tired and numb frequently. Worth noting that this fear of hiv has caused real stress, anxiety, and depression. I haven\u2019t tested because i would rather live with uncertainty than knowing I have it. A positive test would essentially end my life as I wouldn\u2019t want to deal with telling my parents, getting on medication to keep my alive, paying a fortune for medicine and doctors visits and especially never having kids which is what keeps my going. I need help bad. I\u2019m lost I\u2019m confused I\u2019m hopeless"
