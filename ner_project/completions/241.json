    "reddit": "Hi,\n\nI am not completely sure if subreddit is the right place to ask this but I couldn't find a more relevant one, I guess.\n\nI recently (\\~a month ago) moved into a new apartment and started struggling with two odd things. One of them is waking up with phlegm every morning and the other is sleepiness. My observation so far in my life is that my post-nasal drip intensity correlates with the air quality. My previous house was a clean new building and I almost didn't have any phlegm problems; woke up clean. In the house before that I had smoking roommates. I caught later that they were sometimes smoking indoors and I had extreme phlegm problems. \n\nMy new apartment is actually quite an old building and I live on the first floor. When I first moved in, the house didn't smell good and had humidity issues. I run a dehumidifier at home half the day now so it probably helps with the humidity. The odd smell is less intense but is still there. I am wondering if there are certain particulates in the air that I react badly to / decreases my breathing quality. However, I don't know how to test for it or what particulate to begin with. My quality of breathing is overall not great because of a deviated septum and a soft tissue growth inside the one that's already narrow due to the deviated septum. But it seems to be worse here (both before and after I started running the   \n dehumidifier) and I think I just need pointers to start to figure out what the cause is.\n\nAs for sleepiness, I usually sleep 7 hours a day (maximum 8) and wake up feeling energetic. Since I moved in here I seem to want to sleep 9-10 hours, waking up before then makes me feel tired and even then I don't feel energetic in the morning. I have no idea what that would be due to, maybe it just coincided with my move.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAny help would be appreciated.\n\nThank you!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Mandatory info to include:**\n\n**Age:** 24, **Sex:** Female, **Height:** 5\"5', **Weight:** 138 lbs, **Race:** White  \n**Recreational Drugs:**  None,  **Smoking:** No  \n**Current medications:** None, **Diagnosed medical issues:** Undifferentiated tissue rheumatism, generalized anxiety"
