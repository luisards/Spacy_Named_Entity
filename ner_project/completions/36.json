    "reddit": "21, F, White, 120 lbs 5\u20193, Illinois. Vegan diet. Location of concern: tonsil/back of throat. \n\nMedications: Mirena IUD (2 years), vegan multivitamin (Deva), topical clindamyacin 1%, topical tretinoin .05%, topic benzoyl peroxide 10%\n\nConditions: anxiety, endometriosis, TMJ, and eustachian tube dysfunction\n\nI woke up this morning and tasted blood in the back of my throat and took a peek and lo and behold  [there is a red blister on my tonsil](https://imgur.com/0hqXJ5L) among other smaller dots.\n\nIt is painless right now, but I am worried it could be something of concern. I should probably also add that yesterday through today I\u2019ve had ear pain on the opposite side of this blister (left ear) that has resulted in muffled hearing. I assumed it was just my TMJ though. Should I see a doctor or just wait and see if it gets worse? \n\nWhat could it be?"
