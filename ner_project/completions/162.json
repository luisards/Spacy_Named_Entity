    "reddit": "25\nFemale\n5'7\n150lb\nWhite\nDuration - 9 days \nTexas\nBody location - vagina, uterus\nHhx: depression, anxiety, csection July 2018, anemia, on and off yeast infections\nMeds: venlafaxine, ambien, iron supplement\nI'm not including a photo \ufffd\ufffd\n\nMy period is usually extremely regular. I use an app to track it and I'm always right on time each month. However, 1 week after my last period last month I noticed very light spotting. Then 2 weeks after my last period it started becoming medium flow. All the blood is dark brown. Enough flow to need a pantyliner. This has lasted 9 days now. My periods are always heavy and last 6 days, and with this bleeding being right in the middle of my cycle, I know that this is definitely not my period. My husband and I use condoms and I did take a test that said negative. I am not on any sort of birth control, nor do I have an IUD or anything like that. The only thing I can think of is that I've had a history of chronic yeast infections. I had an untreated yeast infection when this started and just took meds for it prescribed by doctor on Wednesday. The bleeding started the day after my husband and I had sex (we usually only have sex once or twice a month) \n\nUp to date was not helpful in trying to identify this and so I'm here crowd sourcing! I'd go to the obgyn but I'm a stay at home mom to a medically complex baby who has multiple doctor appointments and surgeries next week so there is literally no time for myself since she is so sick and she takes priority\n\nThank you!!!"
