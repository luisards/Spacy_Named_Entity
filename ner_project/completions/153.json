    "reddit": "I am 21 years old and I have strong nausea. I Always have the Feeling of puking (never did though) I changed my depression/ocd Meditation named fluoxetine since it could be the Problem. It ist my 3 day of having my new Meditation and my nausea is still there. If I oversleep(sleeping 2long) my nausea gets worse. Do you have any advice for me? I also Sometimes have stomach Problems but eating doesnt make my nausea worse by any means. I didnt eat for 1 day and the nausea was still there."
