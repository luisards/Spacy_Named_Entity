    "reddit": "I am 21 years old and suffer from ocd and depression, I changed my mediciation from fluoxetine. It is the 3 day and my nausea is still there. Stronger than ever. I have it for about 2-3 weeks. I will visit my family doctor tomorrow but honestly I am Not really confident that he will Help me. How should a good doctor react? So I could maybe ask him to do these steps. I also have Sometimes stomach Problems. But my nausea is never related to food. I Just want to ne normal again. I can't do Basic Tasks like cleaning my room. It Just makes me feel very sick and I feel weak aswell."
