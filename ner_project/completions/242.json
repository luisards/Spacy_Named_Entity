    "reddit": "The issue I\u2019m having is that every time I go and see a doctor I get incredibly anxious, and start to have physical symptoms (heart rate goes up to 130+, blood pressure spikes massively, feel sick, etc etc). I have a phobia of my blood pressure/heart rate being taken and it makes it impossible to get an accurate reading. Are there therapists who specialise in this kind of area? Physical symptoms/health anxiety? If so, how does someone find one?\n\nAge: 20\nSex: Male\nWeight: 81kg\nHeight: 6\u20191\u201d"
