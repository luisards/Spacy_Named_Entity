    "reddit": "Out of no where, I have these random attacks where my lungs will just not \u201cfill up all the way\u201d? If that makes sense. I can\u2019t complete a yawn, deep breaths do not suffice; my heart starts racing, I get dizzy, and damn near pass out. I fainted because of it the other day and it\u2019s really starting to freak me out. I could physically feel that I wasn\u2019t getting enough oxygen to my brain. I do not have a URI, my chest X-ray was clear, I was given an Albuterol inhaler which does nothing for the breathing but only worsens the fast heart rate, which triggers my anxiety, and makes my breathing situation worse. From what I\u2019ve tried so far, Klonopin has been the only remedy to this issue.. I am almost never anxious during these \u2018attacks\u2019 so I don\u2019t see it being an anxiety trigger - especially since I\u2019ve had anxiety for a while now, and this has never happened. \n\n\ntldr; It\u2019s just a sudden rush of adrenaline, even my hands can start shaking, my heart starts racing, pounding, my chest gets tight, and sore and I cannot breathe so much so that I get dizzy and feel as though I\u2019m going to faint. Klonopin tends to help.\n\nI don\u2019t know if this helps, but from my lab work, my granulocyte and leukocyte counts were both a bit high, my mean platelet was a bit low. And I recently removed the Nexplanon implant after having it for about 5 years\n\nAge: 21\nSex: female\nHeight: 5\u20193\nWeight: 260\nRace: mixed \nDuration of complaint: 2-3 weeks\nLocation (Geographic and on body): chest/lungs\nAny existing relevant medical issues (if any)\nCurrent medications (if any): Klonopin (as needed)"
