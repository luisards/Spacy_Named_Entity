    "reddit": "So I quit sertraline after taking it for 3 years, i tappered over the course of 6 months and took my last dose 4 weeks ago. Within a week I experienced horrible flu like symptoms, my doctor said it was tonsillitis and prescribed me some antibiotics. After this I kept getting these electerical like dizzy spells I dont know how to describe them but they felt like mini seizures that lasted a few seconds. I am also getting these really weird headaches and muscular pains, today the left side of my face is in allot of pain on top of that I still have flu like symptoms (sore throat, congestion, itching everywhere). Its very hard for me to do anything right now and I was hoping 4 weeks later I would have noticed some improvment. I dont know if the sertraline withdrawl has weakend my immune system. I just wanna know if these symptoms are common amoung ssri withdrawl and how long these symptoms normally last. Should I go back to my gp? Any tips to ease the withdrawal? I looked it up online however I couldnt find anything definitive.
