    "reddit": "I have been on many different varieties of pills for depression &amp; OCD since I was 15. Currently I am on Buspar, Fetzima, &amp; Ativan. For around the past 2 months I have suddenly been dealing with what may be \u2018panic attacks\u2019. I constantly have fear in my head and I can feel it in the pit of my chest &amp; stomach. It\u2019s consumes me 24/7. In addition I am always worried about my health. I convinced myself I have a brain tumor so I think about that all the time as well. I have never experienced anything like this, only normal stress. It has sprung on me quite suddenly. Am I going crazy or does it sound like anxiety/panic attacks? Do you think it will pass soon? I definitely need reassurance."
