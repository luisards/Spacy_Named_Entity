    "reddit": "I\u2019m a 30 year old female with no past history of eye problems other than nearsightedness with a family history of ARMD and a genetic predisposition (Thanks, 23 and Me).\n\nMy maternal grandfather, great uncle, and at least two aunts have/had ARMD but they also didn\u2019t take care of themselves very well, likely had unmanaged hypertension and type 2 diabetes, and smoked like freight trains. I don\u2019t smoke, but I do expose myself to a lot of blue light having grown up in the digital era and working as a systems analyst. \n\nI want to reduce my risk of developing ARMD but the conventional literature seems to indicate you can\u2019t really. Would taking an AREDS -II vitamin formulation prevent anything or would I just be flushing $20 per bottle down the toilet?"
