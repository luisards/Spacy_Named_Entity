    "reddit": "19 year old 5 foot 5 Caucasian female living in MA-USA. current weight is 115 (down from 122 as of 3 months ago). No recreational drugs, rarely drink (less than 1 drink a month), I take junel fe (OCP) for endometriosis and to prevent pregnancy as well as welbutrin (150mg twice daily) for anxiety. For the last few weeks I have been waking up with horrible hunger pains. I always eat dinner. I haven\u2019t changed my eating or exercise habits. As previously mentioned I did lose a bit of weight without changing my diet or exercise habits (7 lbs) about 3 months ago, my doc and I chalked this up to starting the welbutrin. Every morning I wake up with extreme hunger pains. Almost so bad I feel nauseous and I\u2019ll eat and they go away but why is this? Should I be concerned? It doesn\u2019t seem to matter when I eat dinner (last night I ate dinner at 8 and then had a slice of pizza at 10 and still felt these pains at 8am when I woke up)"
