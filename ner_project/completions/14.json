I didn't really want to eat, and even after it my appetite grew smaller. I got stomach flu in March, which also decreased how much I ate. \n\nFor the past week I've hardly eaten anything. I had one fruit snack, a small bite of chicken and I believe that's all. I've tried eating the last few days, but once I put food in my mouth I almost puke. I've also tried eating things that settle lightly, but it was the same outcome."
