I\u2019m currently experiencing tightness and a strong squeezing/burning feeling in my upper left chest\u2014it feels like something is sitting on it. This radiates to my upper left back and shoulder. I haven\u2019t experienced a feeling like this before. My jaw is aching on that side as well, but since I have TMJ issues, my jaw almost always hurts. \n\nI have had panic attacks and acid reflux before. I don\u2019t think this is a panic attack because beyond the pain I am calm, able to breathe normally, albeit with some pain, and this is not presenting like other panic attacks I\u2019ve had. \n\nI\u2019ve eaten a garlic/oil-heavy meal today, and am wondering at what point i see a doctor, or whether I should brush this off as heartburn.\n\nThank you in advance for any help!!"
