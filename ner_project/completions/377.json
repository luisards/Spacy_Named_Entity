    "reddit": "19, female, 5ft 7in, 11st 4, white British, taking rigevidon for contraception, no drugs, no smoking.\n\nSo I've always got shaky if I don't eat for a while which I gather is normal, and I normally get really hungry every 4 hours no matter how much I've eaten.\n\nBut this has gotten MUCH worse since starting the pill again 4 days ago. I am \\*stupidly\\* hungry to the point I feel really sick-which makes it hard to eat, I get heart palpitations, feel incredibly weak, experience anxiety, hot flashes, sweating... this usually improves when I eat, except the palpitations. I was waiting on some food earlier today but these symptoms were rapidly getting worse, I started to feel light-headed and could barely lift my arms until I had some soda. \n\nI've eaten now, still feel pretty weak though.\n\nNot sure how to manage this because it never seems to fully go away. And why has the pill made this so much worse?"
