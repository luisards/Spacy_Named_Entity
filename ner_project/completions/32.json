    "reddit": "Hello doctors of Reddit! I\u2019m sorry if this isn\u2019t the right place for this. \n\nI have an unusual problem. I\u2019m 19 years old, FTM, and having a total laparoscopic hysterectomy on August 19th. My team of doctors has been amazing, the entire staff and my surgeon have put up with a lot of my obnoxious calls and questions and anxieties. \n\nI have a history of abuse including that of the sexual nature. This makes the entire process of going to an OBGYN incredibly anxiety inducing for me. I am in therapy and have been progress in healing from it, but being put under in a surgical scenario where no one can protect me is terrifying. \n\nLately, I\u2019ve been having dreams that when I\u2019m put under they will make fun of me, abuse me, and cut up my genitals without my consent. My fear is fueled by the scandals that happen every so often where doctors are revealed to have made fun of patients while they\u2019re asleep or \u201cpunish\u201d them for being difficult before the procedure. I fear that because I\u2019m somewhat of a high maintenance patient with a fear of not being listened to that this will happen to me. \n\nI KNOW it\u2019s irrational and silly, but I need reassurance from doctors that the professionalism holds up even when patients are not aware or are known for being extra. \n\nPlease help."
