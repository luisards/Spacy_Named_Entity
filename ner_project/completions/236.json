    "reddit": "Hi, \nI\u2019m a 26 year old female, Hispanic, 5\u20196\u201d, and about 128 pounds. For the past 6 months or more I\u2019ve had a serious change in bowel movements. I poop every morning right after I wake up. Sometimes 2-3 times within a few hours of waking. My first poop will usually be solid, but not long, it comes in little pieces, and usually immediately followed by yellow colored softer stools. Most of the time my stools are not completely liquid, but not completely formed either (type 6 on Bristol). They are a bright golden yellow &amp; float. They used to have a strong smell, but as of recently no noticeable smell. No bleeding, but I have seen mucus from time to time. And I only sometimes have pain before having a bowel movement. Once released I feel completely fine again. I don\u2019t have any other symptoms aside from change in bowel movements.\n\nI do exercise 3-4 times a week &amp; my diet isn\u2019t too poor, being that I\u2019ve been trying to eat better since this problem started. I still have fast food from time to time though.\n\nI went to the doctors in May and she prescribed me Florastor. It helped some, but not completely. Now it\u2019s like the Florastor doesn\u2019t help at all. I do take metamucile (for a week now) because I don\u2019t usually get enough fiber in my daily diet. That seems to be making it worse tho. Not sure if I should stop taking the metamucile just yet because I\u2019m trying to do the 14 day challenge.\n\nI have no insurance, but I\u2019m looking to go to a GI soon. Just want to get an idea of what this could be, so I can start with the best test. Can\u2019t afford to be doing this guessing game. I\u2019m thinking it has to do with my gallbladder, but not sure. Any advice or help would be great! I\u2019m freaking out a bit.. health anxiety is no joke."
