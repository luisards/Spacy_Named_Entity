I just &lt;i&gt;feel&lt;/i&gt; like I have no energy, ever since I hit puberty 16 years ago. I spent that entire year on tylenol because my legs were killing me. Ever since, energy gone. Any suggestions would be appreciated. I dunno if I have a mild form of something or what, but any suggestions would be appreciated.\n\nAgain, I can perform physical activities, but I ALWAYS feel like I don\u2019t have the energy for it."
