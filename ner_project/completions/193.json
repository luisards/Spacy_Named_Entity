    "reddit": "I am 28 F, 117 lbs, 5\u20194\u201d white. I take 10 mg of lexapro I have been diagnosed with sleep apnea.\n\nSymptoms: Extreme anxiety, fatigue, urinating frequently, need to sleep after eating, dry eyes and mouth, blurry vision, slow healing cuts, constant vaginal yeast and bacterial infections, and migraines. Sometimes heart palpitations. I get sick very easily and seem to catch every cold and virus. \n \n\nI have had so many blood tests that have \nmostly come back normal but a few showed higher than normal blood sugar and a urine test showed ketones but the doctor said it was likely I hadn\u2019t eaten yet. I have had a low TSH test also but upon resting it showed as low but normal. I also had an abnormal ANA test with a pattern indicating lupus but I saw a rheumatologist but he was not concerned. \n\nI feel like at this point my doctors probably don\u2019t take me seriously. I have had a CT scan and MRI of my brain and a thyroid scan. All normal. I just know I feel bad. I\u2019m not myself. My anxiety has improved since starting Lexapro a month prior but I still feel very badly.\n\nIs there a test for diabetes or just monitoring blood sugar? Should I cut sugar out and see how I feel?"
