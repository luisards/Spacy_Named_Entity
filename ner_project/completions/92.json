    "reddit": "Age: 37 Weight: 205lbs Height: 5' 11\" Drugs: 30mg Lexapro, 40mg geodon. Problems: Depression, auditory hallucinations.\n\nSo anyway, I am going to a psychiatrist and those are my current meds\\^.  The problem is that I'm actually worse off. My depression is worse. I have more anxiety and I get mad thinking about old stuff so much I go yell at people related to it. I'm just more angry overall, more anxious and less functional.\n\nI'll obviously tell my psychiatrist the next time I see her, but what the hell?  What should I suggest I try? I tried risperidone. It made me feel ill. Like it was poisoning me. I won't try abilify because it costs my insurance over $1,000 a month. Zyprexa? It raises blood sugar and I was prediabetic on my last blood glucose test."
