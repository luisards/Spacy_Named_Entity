    "reddit": "Age: 26 Height: 6.5 Weight: 105kg Race: Caucasian Location: Australia No previous related illnesses \n\nI weighed 111kg a month ago, and checking my weight today shows that i have lost 6kg over the last 4 weeks. I have been in Japan for the last 2 and a half weeks, were i feel i have been eating less and walking all day in 30c plus temperature. I only got back 2 days ago and decided to check my weight today to see if it had gone up or down, to find i have lost more weight than i thought i would have. \n\nI've been suffering from a bit of anxiety and insomnia over the last month about the trip i went on, causing me to have a bit of Hypochondria, thinking i have had a variety of illnesses such as throat Cancer due to some acid reflex and heartburn I've been having, to now thinking i have early diabetes, due to loss of weight, a slight tingling sensation in my left, and urinating quite a bit yesterday (Having drunk 2 bottles of alcohol and water before going to bed, making me make 2 trips in the night). Coming back i have been feeling a bit fatigued and tired due to walking in the heat a lot and doing much. \nI didn't eat much during the week before i left due to lack of sleep and worry, and my appetite slowly returned while in japan, but didn't eat as much as i normally would, didn't help that i had some Gerd.\n\nI'm thinking of going to the doctor today, but given the amount of trips i have made prior to leaving, due to worry, i am somewhat worried that they will think i am overreacting."
