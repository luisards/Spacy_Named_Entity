    "reddit": "Age: 25. Female. White. Medical history: glandular a few years ago, nothing else of much note. Medications: Diane 35. \n\nHey guys, \n\nSo I\u2019ve had some symptoms for about six months plus, and they are progressively getting worse. Extreme fatigue, to the point where I can\u2019t even get to class/can\u2019t stay awake when I do (yes, literally falling dead asleep in classrooms). I have periods of low grade fevers, mainly in the early hours of the morning/waking. These periods come and go (eg might have them for a month, then not, then again). I\u2019ve had an enlarged spleen (confirmed by a GP) which is also painful at times. I\u2019ve had a loss of appetite and often only have one meal a day, and often don\u2019t want food at all. As a consequence, I have lost some size but not a heap. Recently I\u2019ve had a mild barking cough every now and then for no discernible reason, and a tight chest. \n\nThen, three weeks ago, I found a lump on my neck. It came up literally over night. One day I didn\u2019t have it, the next I did. It\u2019s off the midline of my neck, to the left, in the \u2018anterior triangle\u2019. It\u2019s quite big (close to golf ball size, maybe ping pong ball or bigger). It feels completely solid, as solid as one of those rubber balls you play with as a kid, the hard ones. I can\u2019t move it around with my fingers. It doesn\u2019t move per say when I swallow or stick my tongue out, like, the lump is still in the same place, but it moves in the sense that it\u2019s attracted to its surroundings and its surroundings move (if that makes sense). It doesn\u2019t hurt, not tender. \n\nAnyway, I got an ultrasound today. The technician looked quite grave and said she wanted to show the doctor the images and see if he wanted to look himself. He did. He had a look and asked her \u2018is there any vascularity\u2019 and she said \u2018there\u2019s some just here\u2019 and pointed to the outside edge of the lump. It was big, like very obvious on the ultrasound, circle, black. \n\nThe radiologist told me I\u2019d likely be referred to an ENT and have a CT, surgery may be an option depending. He said it could be a cyst. \n\nNow, obviously there\u2019s more tests to be done. But I feel like my GP (and I suppose the radiologist, although he didn\u2019t ask me about symptoms and didn\u2019t have any information on my referral other than to scan the neck) aren\u2019t understanding that my symptoms OTHER than the lump are truly concerning me. The lump is getting bigger but it isn\u2019t impacting my life - I\u2019m so tired I literally can\u2019t quite function. \n\nI don\u2019t know whether the lump and symptoms are actually connected, but I want a solution. \n\nAlso how common is it for someone to suddenly have a Thyroglossal cyst issue, golf ball sized, over night and in their mid twenties? I\u2019ve never had a lump in my neck before. I also hadn\u2019t had a cold or flu except three months prior I had a week long cold. \n\nAny suggestions as to what could be going on and how much to push for a solution?"
