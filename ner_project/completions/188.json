    "reddit": "Hey everyone. I've had a problem so to speak in the throat a month ago after I had reflux it felt as if my throat was inflamed and I started taking omeprazole and the reflux was gone but the feeling of a lump was still there and I went to the doctor and took ibuprofen and every symptom was gone now my only concern is that I have this vein in the back of my throat and little kind of blisters. I'm a 19 year old male, latino, 5'10 i weight 189 lbs. If you could tell me what you thing I would very much appreciate it I kind of have health anxiety and is hard to stop worrying.\nThroat image  https://imgur.com/a/4HbtShx"
