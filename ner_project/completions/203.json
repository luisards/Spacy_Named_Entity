    "reddit": "23, 130 pounds, treatment-resistant depression for 6 years, no meds\n\nIve tried literally every depression treatment available: all types of meds, therapy, ketamine infusions, diets, supplements, vyvanse, cbd, transcranial magnetic stimulation, etc, and nothing has worked. I literally never feel like doing anything, nothing brings me pleasure, nowadays even music just sounds like noise.\n\nMaybe Wellbutrin would have worked for me, but both times I tried it it caused pressure in my eyes and I had to stop. It feels like a dopamine issue, not feeling like doing anything, but Wellbutrin is the only NDRI available and I don't want to take stimulants anymore because they started to make me feel worse. Is there any other dopamine-related depression medication?"
