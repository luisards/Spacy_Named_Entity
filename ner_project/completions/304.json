    "reddit": "Hi,\n\nAge:42\n\nSex: Male\n\nHeight: 177cm\n\nWeight: 77kg\n\nRace: Asian\n\nDuration: physical symptoms approx 3 years; mental symptoms approx 18 months but been more severe past 6 months. \n\nLocation: United Kingdom/brain\n\nNo existing medical conditions. \n\nNot on any medication. \n\nI\u2019ve only just seen this forum after posting on the testosterone forum. \n\nI would really appreciate some advice from the forum doctors as I\u2019m trying to understand the rational behind my GP\u2019s decision. I\u2019d also like to know more about the subject before I challenge his decision. \n\nTo investigate some symptoms I am experiencing I decided to have a blood test. The results showed a few elevated markers but I was most concerned with my prolactin. \n\nProlactin 715 mU/L (86-324) or 33.6 ng/mL\n\nFrom what I\u2019ve read online, high prolactin levels can result in low libido and decreased body mass (both of which I\u2019ve experienced). I\u2019ve also read that high prolactin could result in low dopamine and was wondering if this might explain my feelings of depression and my lack of motivation. \n\nAfter discussing the above with my GP he was completely unconcerned about the prolactin. He did question me about my low libido and depression and proceeded to prescribe 37.5mg of Venlafaxine (Effexor).\n\nMy questions are:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. Are my prolactin levels elevated enough to cause the above symptoms? \n2. What levels would be regarded as \u2018optimal\u2019 for a male?\n3. Given a patient has complained about low libido and high prolactin why would a doctor still prescribe a medication that commonly reduces libido and can, albeit rarely, raise prolactin? \n4. I\u2019ve read that prolactin and dopamine have an inverse relationship and so was wondering could that potentially mean my feelings of depression and lack of direction are stemming from low dopamine levels? If that\u2019s reasonable then I\u2019m curious why the doctor would prescribe a SNRI and not a dopamine agonist (Cabergoline) or a NDRI (Wellbutrin) - if this assumption is correct then I will be asking my GP this on my next visit. But I\u2019m all ears to any opinions/guesses.\n5. On the assumption that there should be a balance of serotonin and dopamine and that a high prolactin results in low dopamine, could a SNRI further compound my low dopamine levels?\n\nThank you for taking the time to read all of the above. I hope I provided enough information. But please do let me know if you need more.\n\nSam"
