    "reddit": "Hello, I am a 22 year old caucasian male that weighs 175 lbs and I am 5'9 I also have an anxiety disorder no idea if thats related, I take gabapentin for it (I know weird drug for it, it was originally for a benzo detox to avoid seizures but it helped my anxiety so I stayed on it)\n\nOk so the problem I am having is a little hard to explain, I randomly got this habit a few days ago where i have been putting pressure in my ears habitually, by putting pressure im not sure how to describe it, it isnt like popping my ears its like i put literal pressure in my ear drums and things sound muffled its almost like the opposite of popping your ears its like I am sucking air out of my ears. I noticed I do this almost like breathing when I am not paying attention and I have to physically think about it to stop doing it. It is beginning to hurt and get really annoying but no matter what I do I cant stop doing it.\n\nI am wondering why I randomly got this annoying habit out of nowhere? Is there a cause for me doing this or is it a random habit i have developed? And how the heck do I stop doing it, I have been trying to physically think about not doing it for the past few days and whenever I stop thinking about it, it comes back."
