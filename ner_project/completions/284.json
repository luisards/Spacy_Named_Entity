    "reddit": "* Age: 18\n* Sex male\n* Height 6'0\n* Weight 166 lbs\n* Race Caucasian\n* Duration of complaint  11 hours\n* Location (Geographic and on body)calf and knee joint\n* Any existing relevant medical issues (if any) Just insomnia and poor sleep quality.\n* Current medications (if any) None\n* Include a photo if relevant (skin condition for example\n\nMy leg is a little bit swollen but Advil did help with the pain. I am also getting a slight warm sensation but nothing extreme. The pain was just enough to make me limp slightly before the Advil.    My questions are. Would an Advil help with pain from a deep vein thrombosis,  Is deep vein thrombosis tender to the touch (my leg isn't), and finally how long would I have if I did have deep bein thrombosis?  Two more details that I think are important are that earlier I felt pain right in a blood vessel it only lasted for a little bit but it was a pulsing pain not serious but enough for me to notice.  I also walked for 3 hours today which I think could be the reason why my leg is hurting and what not but the symptoms match deep vein thrombosis so I'm a bit worried.\n\nEDIT: Sorry if I am being paranoid the feeling in my blood vessel (not sure if it was an artery or vein)  in particular gave me a bit of a scare.\n\nUPDATE: Advil got rid of the pain. Should I still be worried?"
