    "reddit": "Complaint: Within the last hour I started experiencing cramping in left lower abdominal region followed by bloody discharge. My last menstrual cycle was 12ish days ago. I have a history of ovarian cysts and endometriosis. The discharge/ pain does not feel similar or familiar to past incidents.  Trying to find out if this warrants a trip to the ER or if I\u2019m okay to wait until I can see regular gyno. Any advice or insight would be greatly appreciated. I have a photo of the discharge if that would help. Thank you for your time. \nAge: 34\nSex: female\nHeight: 5\u20198\u201d \nWeight: 120 lbs\nRace:Caucasian\nLocation of complaint: lower abdomen/vagina\nGeographic location: New York \nDuration of complaint: 1 hour\nRelevant medical conditions: polycystic ovaries and endometriosis \nCurrent medications: N/A"
