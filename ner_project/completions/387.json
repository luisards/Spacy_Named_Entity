    "reddit": "I\u2019m a 16 year old female who is 5 foot 4 inches, and weighs 138 pounds, I don\u2019t smoke, I\u2019m not on any medications, and I don\u2019t have any major physical medical issues now, and I haven\u2019t had any problems in the past either. I\u2019m from Saint Louis, Missouri. I have suffered from episodes of depersonalization and derealization since I was about 7 or 8, really as long as I was mentally capable of recognizing that I was in a different dreamlike state. I am now almost 16 and my depersonalization has gotten much worse through middle school, and through my freshman year of high school I was almost constantly dissociating, and I did some research and came to the conclusion that I had DDD (depersonalization derealization disorder), but then I spoke to a cousin who has experienced the same thing, and who also has severe depression, and she said her depersonalization was just a symptom of her depression, and it improved a lot once her depression was treated. My problem is, I don\u2019t think I was depressed at 7, so I don\u2019t think depression was the cause of my dissociation then. By 7th and 8th grade I certainly was depressed, and beyond that for sure. So now I\u2019m not sure if I have DDD or if it\u2019s just depression. Any insights on this situation would be greatly appreciated. Thank you"
