    "reddit": "Hi, I'm a healthy, 27 year old Asian male in Chicago. I am 5'9\" and 185 lbs. \n\nI'm experiencing stomach problems on a scale of 3-4. So far nothing super debilitating, but I have the following symptoms:\n\n1. Diarrhea for last 2 days, about 20 times on each day I went to the bathroom and my stool was completely watery.\n2. I have had bad pain (about 3-4 on pain scale) in my upper abdomen that was pretty bad yesterday morning. In the past, a few months ago I had this, and I took a 14-day regimen of Nexium and it seemed to help. I started taking Nexium again yesterday based on what I did in the past that seemed successful.\n   1. I think this is an ulcer, because I've been stressed out lately. I've never been diagnosed with an ulcer, but antacids have generally helped.\n   2. If it is chronic, what is the process of diagnosis and what is the treatment typically?\n3. Symptoms originally started as pain in between my belly button and breast bone 3 days ago, so I thought it might be gas or acid reflux, so I took a simethicone. I think it originally made it worse because then I started having diarrhea, but I was farting a ton though, so it did alleviate some gas.\n4. I've been slightly lethargic but my appetite has been a lot lower. I'm not sure if this is because of something I ate, I did have a bag of candy on the day of but I've had candy before.\n5. I stopped taking a probiotic gummy a week ago. Probably not related?\n\nWhat do you think could be causing these symptoms? I think it might be one or two conditions, an ulcer and diarrhea, or a combined issue like the stomach flu. I'm not sure if they are one issue or two issues here and if I'm misdiagnosing myself.\n\nI do know that I have a lot of work to do, and I don't want to take off work this week or spend a ton of money in urgent care or the ER, especially if the diarrhea and ulcer will go away.\n\nI think I will see my PCP in a month or so to get on Pantoprazole, since my sister and father take it.\n\nThank you for all your help, everyone!"
