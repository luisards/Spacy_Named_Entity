    "reddit": "Ok docs, I'm one of those Americans that can't really afford an ER bill if I can avoid it, but honestly I'm getting really fucking scared. It started mid-orgasm Thursday at 4am, sudden, piercing, blinding pain in my right hemisphere. As soon as I could stand again, i took an Imitrex...nothing. Waited 2 hours then did my Fioricet every 4 hours all day Thurs which only made it slightly tolerable. This is abnormal for me, I almost NEVER need more than 2 doses. I tried Benadryl and Gatorade. I tried a multi &amp; B-complex. Friday, diarrhea started and by Friday night I was on the toilet with a bucket. As soon as I vomited, BANG, all at once it felt like something exploded in there &amp; the pain magnified 100x. I cried weakly for a good hour or 2, then husband helped me to bed with yet another Gatorade, a clean bucket, and packed my head in ice. I slept a bit, but am now up at 3:45 am (Saturday now) and it's still really bad. It has not moved location and has been sharp and throbbing in right hemi only. It worsens if I cough, sneeze, bend over, or strain on the toilet (as if my BP increases so does pain). Medical deets: white, 43F, 130lb, history of migraine, gluten sensitive (migraine/diarrhea trigger), seasonal allergy, no history of high BP, high cholesterol or heart disease (yet. I am a smoker of both cannabis &amp; tobacco, NO other drug use). Did my brain bust or is this just the worst headache ever? Can urgent care handle this or is it ER time?\nThanks for any guidance.\nEdit: ER did a CT and spinal tap, all clear! That was just the worst headache *of all time*."
