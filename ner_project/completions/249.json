More blood came out than I thought should from a little dot like this. I was outside so I just let the blood dry up and when I went inside later I cleaned it up and it started bleeding again for a minute, but then stopped, and now it looks like the image I posted below. I guess it scabbed over when I noticed it the first time? I don't remember ever seeing that the day before when I was putting my socks on after my shower, or maybe I just didn't look hard enough. But now my hypochondriac mind is thinking it's a bat bite or a tick or something. It doesn't hurt or itch, but I think my anxiety is playing up and making me believe I have rabies now. I live near woods but haven't seen any bats and I'm pretty sure there are no bats in my house. But now I can't stop thinking I got bit by a bat or something. Does it look like a bite? There's only one spot, though, and wouldn't a bat leave two? Am I worrying over what might be just a simple wound?\n\nImage of the spot: [https://imgur.com/a/vtkgq62](https://imgur.com/a/vtkgq62)"
