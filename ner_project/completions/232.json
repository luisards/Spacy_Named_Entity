    "reddit": "Hi all,\n\nThursday night I started to feel the much too common feeling of a sore throat announcing an illness coming up. Felt a bit tired of Friday but I just had spent a few days in the mountains, so I figured this was nothing to worry about. On Friday night, my girlfriend comes over (last time we saw was Monday) and we have sex. Saturday night, I wake up with full-on cold symptoms and she wakes up with fever and other signs of the flu. I am in a much better state than she is, but I'm worried we might \"exchange\" our infections and both get superinfected. I doubt we have the same infection, this just seem coincidental.\n\nI'm 26m. Pretty active, although I'm travelling right now so diet and sleep are not always the best."
