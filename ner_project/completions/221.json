    "reddit": "Hello, thank you for your time.  My details:\n\n33, white, f, 5'10\", 168 lbs., eyelid, duration- several hours, Maryland, USA\n\nMedications: Geodon, propranolol, lorazepam, benztropine, Adderall, sertraline, birth control, MMJ\n\nMedical: Gastroparesis, PTSD, Aspergers, ADHD, social anxiety disorder, agoraphobia, GAD, OCD. Have had Lasik, dental surgery (wisdom teeth/cyst removal), laparoscopic gallbladder removal.\n\nThis is probably going to seem like a vain question, but I spent 32 years of my life blind as a bat, and just had Lasik last year. I'm finally healed up and have been learning makeup now that I can see my eyes, but tonight I had a bad gastroparesis episode and was in agonizing pain after eating GF pizza, which is usually hit or miss, but that's true of everything solid I eat, unfortunately. When I went in the bathroom to wash my face midway into the pain, which comes in waves, I noticed a protruding vein on my eyelid, from my lashline up and into my crease, and then slightly up into my eye socket. I assume I must've blown it (correct term?) when I was in pain. I haven't included a picture as I'm in bed next to my sleeping husband, but I just have to know... is it permanent? It's been there for several hours now, at least, as I was in a bad way for quite awhile. It's pretty much 3D, and though small, it will probably be noticeable with makeup over it.\n\nLike I said, not trying to be vain (and it's been hard avoiding the puns on this let me tell you). Just another sucky thing about gastroparesis, I guess."
