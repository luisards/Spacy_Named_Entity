A third one appeared a few days ago. Never had any acne there whatsoever. I was recently diagnosed with CRMO. I have some bad health anxiety too and my anxiety brain likes to think skin lymphoma. My lymph node on the left side has been swollen for as long as I can remember. \n[red bumps](https://imgur.com/gallery/uzA47G4)"
