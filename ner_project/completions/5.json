I drink 8 bottles of water a day. Been drinking water like that since 2014. I started noticing light spots on the backs of my thighs in 2016. Soon they crept down to my legs . Then eventually they were everywhere. I have had 3 different Dermatologists and 2 biopsies thus far. 2nd test was sent to some special lab in Atlanta,GA. My current doctor wants to do a 3rd biopsy. I don't see the point. All the tests have shown negative for everything. First doc thought it was some form of lupus. 2nd doc thought it was some form of yeast infection or excema. Now this 3rd doc thinks it's vitiligo and wants me to start doing light treatments twice a week at\u00a0$500\u00a0a pop. What am I rich? I have absolutely no other symptoms. No itching, burning, peeling or flaking. It has always just been a cosmetic issue thank god. But now that I can't hide it under my clothes anymore it's affecting my self esteem. Back when these spots made their debut is right around the same time I was initially diagnosed with Type II Diabetes. The first meds prescribed was Metformin. I really think it has changed my body. I started having all kinds of gut issues that I never had before. Got so bad I had to go to the emergency room. I could barely walk everyday the pain in my abdomen was so bad. Doc said my body wasn't taking well to that medicine so switched to Victoza. Got well but went right back to gut issues. Then switched to Trulicity and Jardiance. I still have gut issues from time to time but not half as bad as it was when I was on Metformin. My dermatologists have proscribed the following creams: Topicort 0.05%, Fluocinolone 0.025%, Triamcinolone Acetonide 0.1%, Desonide 0.05%, Desoximetasone 0.05% and Elidel 1%. The last doc also had me try ointment: Eucrisa 2%. None of these meds have worked. For each of them I tried it out for 2-3 months only on isolated body parts so I could monitor and contain any potential adverse affects. I have also tried home remedies like apple cider vinegar and selenium sulfide 1% to rub on affected skin twice a day. I've also taken orally Diflucan 150 mg 3 doses 1 tablet every 3 days. Did that a few times. No change. I don't believe this is vitiligo. Seems vitiligo is more akin to patches of light areas instead of tiny spots everywhere.\u00a0 I feel I need to also include a history of my skin conditions. Growing up I never had issues with skin as a teenager. Never had much acne only the lonely pimple maybe once a year. In 2007 I moved to FL for a year and then came back home to AL with weird blisters growing all over my face. Local clinic tried to tell me it was a form of HPV. Didn't believe it at the time didn't start having sex until 2009. In 2008 a doctor diagnosed me with muluscum. Had it about 4-6 months. Doc prescribed Aldara 5% cream that was $300-400 for 12 doses per box and had to use 2 doses a day. I couldn't afford anymore after first box. It didn't work. Tried home remedy using\u00a0$4\u00a0bottle of Dr. Tichenor's antiseptic mouthwash on the blisters cleared it up in two weeks!\u00a0Smh. About that same time started getting boils all over my body. Didn't know what they were at first and let a few grow huge and painful. Had a few lanced at the hospital. Fast forward years later 2016 when I started seeing dermatologists for the spots also talked to them about the boils. Was told it's from staph infection. One doc said I should take bleach baths to keep the boils away. Tried it but stopped after a while just don't like the idea of bleach in my bath water. Another doctor prescribed Mupirocin 2%. I am to use directly on the boils. Also told to rub inside my nose daily to prevent them from forming. It works like a charm. But I assume I gotta use this stuff for the rest of my life? I have also tried using the Dr. Tichenor's on my spots. No changes. Ok hope I covered everything...Anybody seen this crap before? Any suggestions on treatments? I'm bout done paying money for doctors to tell me nothing and prescribe s every medication that doesn't work. \ufffd\ufffd"
