No I do now smoke.\nSometimes (but not all the time) when I go for a run I get this pain in the middle of my chest it hurts when I start taking deep breaths but at the same time it helps me take the pain away and drinking water also helps.Not all the time but once in a while I get a really bad cough like almost a flu cough and it really hurts the same area. This doesn\u2019t happen all the time just sometimes when I push myself or when I run after a long time without running what could this be? Should I be worried?"
