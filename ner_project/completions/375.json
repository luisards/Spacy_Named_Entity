    "reddit": "I had an endoscopy 2.5 weeks ago, yesterday I got a call from the nurse saying I had esophageal candidiasis. She did not seem concerned at all. She told me to pick up the prescription they sent to my pharmacy (anti fungal I believe have not picked it up yet I'm at work and was out of town yesterday) and take it once a day until it is gone. Anyway, I look up this condition after I get off the phone with her and it says most people who get it have HIV/AIDs, cancer, diabetes etc. etc. I do have a history 8 years of GERD so I am thinking this is the culprit.. but should I be concerned  that I have some other underlying condition? Or do healthy people with GERD get this sometimes? Thank you very much!\n\n* Age: 27\n* Sex: Female\n* Height: 5 ft. 5 in.\n* Weight: 135 lb\n* Race: Caucasian\n* Duration of complaint: Diagnosed yesterday (endoscopy on July 26)\n* Location (Geographic and on body): Milwaukee, WI/ Esophagus \n* Any existing relevant medical issues (if any): GERD\n* Current medications (if any): Ranitodine twice daily, was previously taking Omeprazol, Nuvaring birth control"
