    "reddit": "I\u2019m 20 \n\nFemale \n\n107 pounds \n\nmedications: birth control \nnever been diagnosed with anxiety or depression but I went to therapy for some anxious thoughts I was having. I don\u2019t have any other health problems except sometimes I have no appetite and I struggle with neck pain.  \n\nI\u2019m not sure if I should have posted this in an another thread but about 3-4 times a week, I wake up around 4ish and go back to sleep to later wake up at 7. Some of the time I can remember waking up because of a nightmare or an incredibly vivid dream. This has been happening for about a year. It doesn\u2019t bother me that much but it\u2019s kinda annoying to wake up every night. I\u2019m always surprised that I slept through the night because I usually don\u2019t. \nI\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s connected to anxiety or something... since I\u2019m having nightmares so often but yeah not totally sure."
