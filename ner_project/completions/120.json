    "reddit": "White F22, 5.7, 114 pounds, not on any medication or drugs.\nToday i woke up and noticed a very small lump right below my ear next to my jaw. I can't properly see it, but i can feel it and it hurts when i touch it. It feels like a pimple. I've had problems with acne before and my period is about to start which makes me prone to acne, but I've never had any on this area before. Depending on how i move my head, the lump can become hard or feel like it's never been there in the first place, completely soft. I thought about it being a mosquito bite or maybe i hurt myself in my sleep considering i woke up with my hand already on the place the lump is located. Obviously my anxiety is telling me it's cancer. Don't have a history on the family tho. I have to wait 2 to 3 months for a doctor appointment. Should i be worried?"
