    "reddit": "17 yrs old, 176cm and 68kgs.\n\nPain a little above the ankle, right side of my right leg.\n\nOkay so, last year I played basketball and I was running for a fast break that I slammed my body to a wall since I wasnt looking in front (was looking at the ball being passed) and was screaming in pain after that, mainly my leg.\n\nFast forward to today, I didn't really care that much but there's slight pain when I run and when I squeeze a certain part of my right leg, it hurts so much. There's no swelling, change of color to the part where it's hurting. Planning to call the doctor tomorrow but I can't sleep and is having anxiety about it."
