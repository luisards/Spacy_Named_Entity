    "reddit": "Hello! I\u2019m in India right now visiting family for a wedding and on the way to the reception (in the car) I felt a pinch on my foot. I was wearing flats, so the top of my foot was exposed (though I was wearing socks), and a really long dress. I was half-asleep (jet lag and the drive was, like, 30 minutes long) so I just shrugged it off, but when I came to a few minutes later I looked at my foot to see what the deal was. I didn\u2019t see a bat anywhere near it. \n\nI\u2019m concerned, though, because when I went home I found two little holes (raised somewhat) right where I felt the pinch. It was itching throughout the night, so I thought it could\u2019ve been a mosquito bite until I saw the two punctures.\n\nI feel totally crazy, though, because this would\u2019ve happened in the car, and since there was no bat in the car on the way back, it would\u2019ve had to have clung to my dress and then flew or fell off when I got out of the car on the way there. \n\nI thought it might\u2019ve been a mosquito that tried to bite me through my sock twice, but it doesn\u2019t look like my other mosquito bites at all. Both scenarios seem kind of far-fetched, but I am especially worried about the bat one because of the high risk of rabies in India. I also see all kinds of bats (small, big) flying around the city at dusk. \n\nI am 24 years old, Caucasian, have OCD/GAD, worry about bats a lot, am in Hyderabad, India for 10 days, and am having a really rough time. \n\n(I will attach a picture as soon as I have WiFi...)"
