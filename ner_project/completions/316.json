    "reddit": "Age: 32\n\nSex: Male\n\nHeight: 5'10\n\nWeight: 110\n\nRace: White\n\nDuration of complaint: A few weeks\n\nLocation (Geographic and on body): Chest\n\nAny existing relevant medical issues (if any): None\n\nCurrent medications (if any): None\n\nFor the past several weeks, about once a week I'll experience this really intense squeezing sensation in my chest that lasts about half a second. It's not like heart palpitations at all -- I've gotten palpitations my whole life and I can tell the difference. Unlike the usual \"flutter\" feeling of a palpitation, this feels like something is slamming really hard against my ribcage for half a second. It's an intense \"squeezing\" feeling that comes with a powerful thump, and then it's immediately over. It's also kind of like if someone threw a ball and hit you in the chest -- force to accompany the squeezing, but nothing that I'd consider \"crushing\" or painful. It doesn't feel \"heavy\" or like something is weighing down on my chest. It's more like something slamming against my ribs or like my heart is squeezing really hard for just one squeeze. I'll check my heart rate afterward and it'll be normal.\n\nThis is usually accompanied by weird lingering tightness in the muscles in my chest/ribcage. I think if I move around, the tightness changes, but I'm not sure. My chest wall also often feels \"sore,\" especially if I've been doing any exercise that affects my chest, but I don't know if that's related to the powerful thump/squeeze thing.\n\nIt's always one, solitary squeeze and then it's over as quickly as it started. There is never any nausea, dizziness, intense pain, fainting, etc. No pain shooting down my arm or anything like that. I usually feel absolutely fine otherwise.\n\nI know I'm young, but I had a heart murmur all throughout childhood, and I'm extremely underweight, and have been my whole life. I have a lot of weird (but very minor) nerve pain and tingling that I've had my whole life that travels from my chest down my left arm into my fingers. It comes and goes, and is often a result of panic attacks or sleeping funny on my arm/chest. I have no idea if this is related to this new sensation, either. I do have a ribcage that curves in the wrong direction and I seem to have weird issues with my chest in general.\n\nI was scared enough by the nerve tingling to get an EKG a number of years ago and I was diagnosed with a benign Right Bundle Branch Block. Again, I have no idea if this is related.\n\nThis squeezing thing just hit me out of nowhere a few minutes ago and it was so deep in my chest and distinctive that it really scared me. I had to calm myself down over a few minutes and convince myself that I wasn't having a heart attack. I was almost tempted to hop in the car and go to the emergency room, and I'm still wondering whether I should go or not.\n\nMy risk factors are: extremely underweight, heart murmur at young age, Right Bundle Branch Block, anxiety issues/overworked heart from years of being anxious.\n\nThings against it being heart-related: I recently went to the doctor for something else and had unusually good/low blood pressure. I have no family history of heart disease or heart attacks.\n\nShould I seek medical attention ASAP? Is this more likely to be my heart or a muscle in my chest wall somewhere?"
