My previous TSH test has always shown on the load side but this is the first time recent test I have a full complete thyroid test. I understand that low TSH indicates hyperthyroid but all the results are in within range. \n\nI also tested for low testosterone but my pituitary also came back within normal range.  I think my symptoms might be related to low testosterone but I also have oily skin and more?  sweating, for example I feel like I sweat more than my peers if we are in the same condition therefore sometimes I don't over dress for this reason. But I don't know if thyroid and testosterone are in anyway related. \n\nSo my question is, is the thyroid test a clear cut that I don't have thyroid issues?"
