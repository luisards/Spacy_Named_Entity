    "reddit": "Age: 23\nSex: F\nHeight: 5\u20195\u201d\nWeight: Idk but normal!\nRace: white\nDuration of complaint: about 9 hours\nLocation: head\nExisting medical issues: have had migraines before\nCurrent meds: nexplanon, spironolactone\n\nHey guys! I joined this sub specifically to ask about this issue so please let me know if I\u2019m doing something wrong. Thanks in advance.\n\nSince I woke up this morning (about 9 hours ago), I\u2019ve had a dull but strong pain behind my left eye. It\u2019ll hurt randomly, but more often when I\u2019m moving my eyes. For about half an hour or so earlier today, I also felt a very strong pressure in my head, like someone grabbed my head and squeezed it. Those are the only symptoms. I took excedrin twice now in case it is a migraine to help prevent any headaches, and so far there hasn\u2019t even been a hint of a headache. However, the eye pain hasn\u2019t gotten any better. I\u2019ve had a handful of migraines before, but haven\u2019t had one in years. I\u2019ve only had textbook ones (headache, aura, nausea...), never one like this.\n\nWhat do you think? Migraine?"
