    "reddit": "I\u2019m a 19 year old white male, 120 pounds, 5\u20198, with congenital heart disease and depression. No medications.\n\nSo I\u2019m going to be honest upfront and say that I\u2019m beginning to think I may have some form of undiagnosed health anxiety or OCD. Please forgive me if these concerns are ridiculous or unfounded. Basically yesterday I accompanied a family member into a CT room while they were having a scan done. I was told this was okay and that I should just stand behind a mobile lead glass barrier in the corner of the room. The results didn\u2019t show any issues but now all I can think about is the amount of radiation I exposed myself to while in the room. I\u2019m worried it may have damaged or destroyed brain cells, and increased my risk of cancer. I can tell even reading this now how dumb it all sounds but I can\u2019t help it."
