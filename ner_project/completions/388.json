When I was younger, family, teachers etc would keep at me to \"stand up straighter\" but it felt like my back was way too tight and painful if I kept it straight for prolonged periods of time. When my back started hurting chronically, I kept being told it was because I slouched too much, but it was a catch 22 kinda deal. My family doc was investigating my back as well as a hole or dimple above my butt (called a sacral dimple?). It got to the point where it became unbearable at times this year so an ER doctor had an MRI of my spine done. Just wondering what some of this means:\n\n*FINDINGS: The lumbosacral spinal alignment appears within limits of normal. There is mild disc dessication at l5-S1 as well as disc space narrowing at l3-4, in keeping with degenerative disc disease. (conus medullaris ends at l2, no spinal cord abnormality on the films).*\n\n*At L3-4, there are mild degenerative changes of the facet joints. At l4-l5, there is ligamentum flavum hypertrophy as well as mild degenerative change of the facet joints. At l5-s1, a very minimal disc bulge is identified with minimal ligamentum flavum hypertrophy and facet joint degenerative change. There is no significant central or foraminal stenosis.*\n\nThanks for the help!!"
