I take Venlafaxine hydrochloride in the morning for my depression,  112.5mg every morning. I don\u2019t smoke or do any recreational drugs. \n\nI\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s worth seeing a doctor or if it\u2019ll go away on its own, however the swelling does go down at times. I thought it was a hangnail so I attempted to pull it out but it didn\u2019t work and just caused it to hurt."
