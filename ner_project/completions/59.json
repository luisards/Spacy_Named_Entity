    "reddit": "Age: 16    \nWeight: 168 pounds  \nSex: Male  \nGeographic location: South Dakota   \nDuration of Complaint: 6 months\n\n(I'm 16 years old, 168 pounds, 6'2, white American; have never done drugs) \n    Hey thanks for stopping by this post, any ideas/advice means the world to me, more then the world actually. Well, this summer it feels like I have lost all of my friends. Nothing interests me to much anymore, I used to love the outdoors. I am always feeling tired/fatigued, very low motivation, nervousness/anxiety, have always had diarrhea regularly for the past 3-4 years (not sure if thats needed) and a great feeling of brain fog, almost numb and forgetful. Especially when speaking to people, almost as if I'm in third person and it takes me a good few seconds to register what people say. I'm only a junior and its crazy, its like I'm losing all hope and do not feel comfortable at all talking to people, I talk to my parents but I don't even hug them anymore. The thing is, I went into my doctor and talked about these problems, we did immediate bloodwork and it looked like my kidneys were a bit damaged, (not super important) by higher amounts of chemicals, I forgot the name. But my blood sugar was at 59, before I went to the doctor (1-1/2 hours) I had two peanut butter sandwiches and a glass of orange juice. Any idea why my blood sugar was so low? The part that makes me hopeless is I purchased a tester kit and tested it 4 days after the doc appointment and it read around 93, and around 113 after I ate food. I'm stumped, I still feel horrible and I lost my lead that gave me hope. Anything, I mean any ideas would be amazing, I just feel like this is a physical problem, not a mental problem, maybe its just giving me symptoms of depression."
