I deal with the flu and cold like any hard, badass dude would - crying and snotting into 8 boxes of tissues while I bitch to my gf about how miserable I am. \n\nSo exactly 11 days ago I went to Loch Raven Reservior (freshwater) and rented a boat for my birthday. It was extremely hot and after a few hours on the water it was either anchor up on the shoreline and cool off in the water or let the sun murder me.\n\nAbout 15 minutes back in the boat I pulled my shoe off as my right foot was in a good deal of pain. My foot was red and a little swollen but most of the pain was coming from 2 blisters that appeared on my toes. A few days go by and the swelling goes down. But the blisters have popped and are oozing pus through bandaids every 20 minutes. \n\nOver the next 5 days, I do my best to keep the sores clean and dry. But they spread to my left foot and up both my legs, beginning as blisters and eventually popping and refusing to \"crust up\" and heal. Some worse than others and growing in size. Just soaking through bandaids. I also begin experiencing soreness/tenderness in my lower back.\n\nCome the 5th, I decide against cancelling the vacation we planned and head out for a camping trip. On the car drive there, my back pain jumped up to a 10, I had some sharp pain stomach cramps, and I felt extremely dizzy. Almost blacked out inside the restroom of a Royal Farms. After a few hours, the dizziness and cramps subsided but the back pain remained and I had diarrhea for 3 days. \n\nAfter 3 days of 5 to 10 back pain and constant diarrhea I cut the vacation short to come home and visit my PCP. I waited 2 hours from the time of my appointment only to be told \"You picked something up. You're young. You'll bounce back\". By this time, my first 2 sores are beginning to heal. But more pop up every day and others are getting bigger. Not to mention the back pain that fluctuates between a 5 and a 10 every 8 hours. Feeling I needed a 2nd opinion I went to Urgent Care the same day. \n\nAt Urgent Care, my urinalysis came back ok, so I was told I wouldn't be given anything, but that the back pain was concerning and could be kidneys so I would need to go to the ER for blood work. Frustrated, I decided it was best to just nip it and go. So after a wait there, blood was drawn and tests came back clean.\n\nSo here I am, back at a 6 or 7, feet and legs oozing pus at uncontrollable rates, being told \"you know what this reminds me of? Mosquito bites. It's definitely not infected.\" Rather than scream profanities at this doc for wasting my time (she probably felt I was wasting hers but no part of me wanted to be in the ER at midnight for simple blood tests) I left with a handful of bacitracin with zinc.\n\nI've no more sick hours to use, and I'm not looking forward to spreading pus around in my shoes and lifting heavy boxes off the floor all day. Every symptom is gone but the back pain and rapidly spreading blisters/sores. What are my options here? I guess I'll just die?\n\nTLDR: Multiple docs refuse to treat my sores and/or pain. My extreme discomfort is worth slowing the progress of resistant bacteria apparently."
