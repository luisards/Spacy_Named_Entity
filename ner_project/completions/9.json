    "reddit": "&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Age: 26\n* Sex: Male\n* Height: 5'8\n* Weight: 150\n* Race: White - British\n* Duration of complaint - at least a good several years (can't remember just how long)\n* Location: fingernails on right hand, on right hand palm and left index fingernail.\n* Any existing relevant medical issues (if any): Depression (meds may interact with a fair amount of oral treatments)\n* Current medications (if any): Fluoexetine\n* Include a photo if relevant (skin condition for example):  [https://imgur.com/a/LNpz7Cw](https://imgur.com/a/LNpz7Cw)   \n\n\nDescription: A good few years ago, my fingernails starting to go brittle and a white semicircle starting to show through the nails, creeping their way from the base and growing further. The nails began to crumble and fall out. They now never grow back attached and I have to keep them well clipped. If I even try to grow them back I seem to hit them off things without fail and the pain of the trauma of the small bump is absolutely agony and it's like they go \"Oh well :)\" and detach again. Even if I don't they'll find other ways to detach or just flat out not attach to the nailbed properly when growing out.   \n\n\nThe sides of the nails don't seem to want to settle and stay with the skin, so I think the shape of the nail beds must be ruined by it also. Also, the skin on my right palm peels constantly: it's difficult to see in the pic because I made the mistake of applying vaporub to them in a current attempt to try and get my palm not look so messed up so the oiliness is hiding the flakiness. They look disgusting and I just know people (girls especially) must look at them and go eww wtf don't want those filthy things near me. Any advice on what exactly it is and what I can do? I've been told it might be nail fungus but the online info about this for fingernails or what it is seems to be so limited. I'm not usually a self-conscious person about a lot but constantly seeing these and the agony of knocking them off things has pushed me to breaking point so I need to know how the hell to get rid of these things. I'm sick of being told \"Oh they'll grow back, just be patient\" Been told that years and they just won't; they refuse to.   \n\n\nSorry for the rant. Any help would really be appreciated."
