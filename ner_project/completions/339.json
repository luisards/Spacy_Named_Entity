    "reddit": "Hi there, on sunday morning at 3AM (basically sat night) i was getting ready for bed and didn't have my glasses and hit my head really really hard on my closet door. i don't think i lost consciousness and didn't feel nauseous but when i woke up in the morning (around 8AM sun morning) I had an awful headache that stayed with me the entire sunday tied with some dizziness, which I am not sure was related to the injury or my general anxiety which was heightened by this situation. i went to the doctor yesterday (monday morning) and she did a bunch of tests with the light and all the reflexes, she felt around my neck , etc. and said i have nothing to be worried about. the constant headache as subsided for the most part. i do get sudden like slightly dull pangs but it's not unbearable and i am still feeling somewhat dizzy, not sure if it's related tho. i am really freaked out tho and am not sure if i need a second opinion. \n\nAge 25\n\nSex: Female\n\n Height: 5'4 \n\nWeight: 135lb\n\nLocation on Body: Right top corner of head\n\nMedical issues: anemia, allergies, asthma\n\nMedications: Xopenex, Symbicort"
