    "reddit": "I am 21F, 140 lbs, 5'2\". I take Corticosteroids for asthma with a rescue inhaler. I wear glasses and have an astigmatism. \n\nI am a waitress. I noticed there was a small spot in my vision that was constantly blurry. It was small though, and I figured it was just a floater. Twenty minutes later and about half of what I could see with my left eye was blurry and I was seeing stars in both my eyes. \n\nAnother twenty minutes went by and in that time I regained full vision. While the blurriness grew gradually, when it went away it all disappeared at one time. \n\nIs this something I can just shrug off since it only happened once?"
