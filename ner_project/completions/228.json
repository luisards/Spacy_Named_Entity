I tried to snack on an ice cream yesterday, but after one lick I got scared and threw it away. My fear of sugar, while still there (only minor), is now replaced with fear of sodium. I look at everything to see what and how much salt it has. I\u2019m tired, physically drained, and can\u2019t seem to go on.\n\nYesterday I did something stupid, although it wasn\u2019t intentional. I had a headache and chills so I swallowed a Tylenol pill, when that didn\u2019t work I opted to take a couple more and when I realized that 7 were already consumed I panicked. My friend helped me vomit so I could avoid going to the ER.\n\nIt seems no one believes me that I have a hunch of illnesses. I somehow diagnosed myself, and even worse, convinced myself that I have: hepatitis C, GERD, cancer, diabetes (still), heart disease, pancreatitis, failing kidneys, failing livers, failing pancreas, hypertension and poor eyes.\n\nI really don\u2019t know what to do anymore. Should I admit myself into a hospital? No one seems to believe me that I have these illnesses and I don\u2019t want to die because no one cares."
