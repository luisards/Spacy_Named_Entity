    "reddit": "Hello,\n\nMy name is Ryan and I\u2019m a 19 year old male with anxiety. Beginning in July at random, I started feeling an intense pressure feeling in my abdomen region. It\u2019s above the belly button up to the center of chest region. Sometimes I might feel it below the navel.\n\nNo matter what I eat or drink, I feel bloated after eating anything. I tried looking for things that aggregated it or relieved the sensation, but I can\u2019t find anything. I notice I started having a bowl moment every morning, 5 minutes after waking up for a few weeks now.\n\nI also noticed a liquid sensation in my lower stomach when waking up. It\u2019s strange considering I still feel this liquid after using the bathroom. I have seen a GI and they gave me anti-acids to see if it helps and then suggested an endoscope of the stomach if it didn\u2019t help....which I fear about getting. I\u2019ve also had an abdominal ultrasound recently which came back as normal.\n\nIf anybody has any suggestions what this could possibly be, I would appreciate it. I don\u2019t have any nausea, diarrhea, or typical acid reflux symptoms as far as I can tell. It\u2019s just a bloating/pressure feeling. Extremely uncomfortable.\n\nThank you!"
