    "reddit": " \n\n* Age: 29\n* Sex: M\n* Height: 5'2\"\n* Weight: 133lbs\n* Race: Hispanic\n* Duration of complaint: a few days\n* Location (Geographic and on body): United states/On Body: testicles\n* Any existing relevant medical issues (if any): None\n* Current medications (if any): None\n\nSo about a week ago I had a scare where I felt like one of my testicles was twisted, it corrected itself, and throughout the week I had a bit of minor pain there, so I went to the doctor and he said that everything was fine after checking, palpating, checking for hernias, lumps etc. I asked him if I had Bell Clapper Deformity because I could sometimes feel the testis rotate in the scrotum at times, and he said he wasn't sure but that my stuff looked normal. And I was fine for a few days, until tonight when I went to sleep and laid down, flat on my back I immediately felt both testicles tighten, so I quickly stood up and inspected and it seemed like the cremaster muscle went haywire because my scrotum seemed completely flat, so i started panicking and placed my hand over it to give it some warmth and slowly they came back down and took their usual spots. When I attempted to lay down again I felt the exact same thing and this time it seemed like both of my testicles were stuck, bunched up in front, with the cremaster muscle kicking in. *There is no pain*, but I am worried that it means that some sort of blood flow is getting cut off if they go back down but aren't all the way in the scrotum.  Even though its very warm, the muscle is still taking effect. Is it something to do with the legs? Is laying down somehow activating a movement in my scrotum, which eventually leads to the cremaster coming into play?\n\nIs it possible to have an extreme case of Bell Clapper develop later in life? Does torsion always involve pain? I'm afraid to even attempt to move them down because they just don't feel normal, and because I don't want to mess anything up if anything is even wrong with them. Is there a method or are there any methods to correct this surgically?\n\nI am just shaky and nervous and scared because I have never experienced anything like this. Is it purely psychological or could there be something very wrong with me? As far as I know I haven't injured my testicles in any way. So I'm not sure if the reason why they are so elastic and then quickly tighten would be due to low testosterone production in my body. Sorry about all the questions, it's just that its 5:55am and I really don't know what to do or if there is anything anyone can do and I have gotten no sleep because of this, what am I supposed to do, stand up and sleep?  \n\n\nNote that this has never been an issue before, I've been able to go to sleep without having to solely sleep flat on my back to prevent any possible torsion, but lately its all I have done because I wouldn't want to turn over in bed and end up with something like torsion.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTIA to those who reply!"
