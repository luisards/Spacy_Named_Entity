    "reddit": "Age: 30\nSex: female\nHeight: 5\u201910\nWeight: 165 pounds \nRace: White European\nDuration of complaint: 2-3 months\nLocation: UK, top of foot and thigh. \nExisting medical issues: migraine, anxiety. \nCurrent medication: 30mg amitriptyline daily to prevent migraine. \n\nBasically, I\u2019m getting odd bodily feelings and I don\u2019t know whether they are something I should see a doctor about, something normal that happens and isn\u2019t a big deal, or something that\u2019s a feature of anxiety. \n\nIt started with a feeling in my upper thigh like a phone vibrating. I know phantom vibration is a thing (and the location is near where my phone usually is) so I figured it was that. However for about 2 or 3 months I\u2019ve also been having this feeling in the top of my foot (same side as the feeling in my thigh). \n\nIt\u2019s sporadic and I think I can go days without it or sometimes have the feeling a couple of times a day persisting for a couple of minutes a time. It is not a usual feeling of pins and needles, more of a buzz. I\u2019ve not been able to note any kind of pattern. It happens more often when I am sitting but has also happened when walking or driving. \n\nIf relevant I had some lower back pain about 4 weeks ago which resolved itself in about 5 days with otc painkillers, and I have had on and off issues with anxiety throughout my life but they are particularly heightened at the moment and I am lined up for counselling starting in a few weeks."
