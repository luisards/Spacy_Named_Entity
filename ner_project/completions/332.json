    "reddit": "I am a 28 year old male, 5'8, 195pounds with anxiety and panic disorder.  I take clonazepam 1mg once a day, and pantoprazole 20mg once a day.  \n\nYesterday, August 5th, I came home from work noticing both of my testicles were sore and upon feeling them, pain in both.  Not an overwhelming to-your-knees kind of pain...just pain.  It has since not subsided after now a full 24hours.  They abnormally have always hung very low, and I don't remember smacking them by accident or squishing them, and I haven't masturbated in almost a week/haven't had sex in three months.  However, upon just checking...I have an abnormal painful lump on my right testicle, with a jagged edge to it.  And upon feeling said lump, the pain in my testicles have gotten worse.\n\nI'm worried about the obvious... testicular torsion, or worse...a tumor/cancer.\n\n\n***Edit: UPDATE.  Ultrasound came back negative on cancer/tumors/torsion or epiditimidis.  So...there's that.  But still don't know what's wrong and pain is still clearly present"
