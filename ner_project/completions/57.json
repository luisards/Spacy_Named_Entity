    "reddit": "Age: 23\n\nSex: M\n\nHeight: 6'0\n\nWeight: 193\n\nArea affected: mouth and maybe eyes\n\nMedications: none\n\nFor the past 2 weeks, I've had chronic dry mouth. Just recently (within the past day or two) I noticed my eyes may be dry too. They dont feel dry or itch, but I was watching a sad movie and started to \"cry\" but no tears came out. That being said, I'm mainly concerned about my dry mouth because it seems no matter how much water I drink, my mouth stays dry and my tongue stays a whitish pink color. I've read about Sjorgens, but that seems highly unlikely as it usually affects women 40 and older. What else could it be? I went to my doc last week and he tested me for diabetes. The fasting result came back at 100, which I read is technically considered prediabetes, but my doc didnt seem concerned at all. He didnt say why I had dry mouth, only that I definitely didn't have diabetes. I just want to know what's wrong with me. Please anybody help."
