There\u2019s a thing where I can check my heart rate whenever I want and my resting heart rate each day seems to range from 57-64, which scares me. I know it is good to have a low resting heart rate, but I haven\u2019t been exercising lately and I am overweight. It could also mean I have good heart health but I\u2019m not sure. I have no other symptoms(or ones that relate to this). Should I schedule a doctors appointment"
