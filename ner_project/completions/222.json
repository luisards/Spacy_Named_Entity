    "reddit": "Well, to be clear, I kinda do, but most sounds are just heard and I have barely any clue where it's coming from. Like my brain knows that it came from behind me, but when listening to music or playing video games specifically I find it hard to position the sounds like I used to before I had an ear infection in both ears about 2 years ago now. I'm only 19, male, I hope my hearing isn't going bad. It's better some times than others, no specific trends. I've since had a hearing test and I have perfect hearing, so what could be causing this? Should I get my ears checked for earwax blockage or something similar? Could it be due to stress or anxiety? Low dopamine? Thanks."
