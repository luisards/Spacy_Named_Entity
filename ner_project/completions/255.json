If you metabolize normally would you not have lesser of the side effects? Or Am I completely misunderstanding this thing entirely \n\n\nI ask because I\u2019m starting to feel like my genesight testing is a load shit \nI\u2019ve gotten adverse allergic reactions to medications I supposedly metabolize correctly \n\n\nAnyways so I don\u2019t get removed\nFemale white 29 122 lbs non smoker non drinker \nAnxiety disorder // Ativan 0.5mg as needed\n\nThanks again for asking my query"
