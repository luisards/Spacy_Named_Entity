    "reddit": "I have recently noticed that there are a couple of squishy lumps in my vas deferens (I'm not 100% sure if that is what it is but it's around that area). It's been there for about two months. They are only on my left one and go away after I masturbate but come back a few hours later, or if I don't masturbate for like 4 days. I used to masturbate daily but now i only do it a couple times a week. When I squeeze them it doesn't hurt at first and then it feels like I have a hernia in my hip. I couldn't find anything online and I'm too embarrassed to have a doctor look at it.
