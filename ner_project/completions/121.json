    "reddit": "I had a STD screen on Tuesday (8/27), my doctor told me they would call in a 1-2 weeks. I had one in December and everything came back negative besides HSV 1, I\u2019ve had that since childhood. I have always wore a condom and I\u2019m straight. I have had sex with four women, one positively knowing she was a virgin.\n\nMy doctor said she won\u2019t call until after every tests comes in so that she doesn\u2019t call after each result saying something is negative, so I\u2019m assuming I should be fine with HIV. The reason I have HIV concerns is because I always assume the absolute worse is going to happen to me with anxiety, no one in my past has alerted me of any std. Please help. I assume that HIV would be one of the first results and she has the results but I don\u2019t want to be annoying and call to ask?  Also assuming if she does have results, if it were positive she would\u2019ve called me immediately."
