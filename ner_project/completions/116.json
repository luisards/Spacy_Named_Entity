    "reddit": "&amp;#x200B;\n\nI injured my face a long time ago as a child, and in turn, my nose was slightly malformed, however, I finally got corrective Rhinoplasty a few weeks ago. But something has been bothering me since the surgery.\n\nSome of my rib cartilage would be needed to extend the nose, ergo, I knew I wouldn't be able to wear a bra during the surgery. When I was walking down to be operated on, the nurse even ensured I wasn't wearing my bra under my hospital gown, on top of any jewelry. I assumed I was allowed to wear my underwear since my nose isn't anywhere near my nethers. The IV was inserted as per usual, and I don't recall anything else being done.\n\nSo I wake up, a little bit fuzzy, and the first thing I notice is that there's a tube up my vagina, so at first, I'm confused, wondering why there's a tube up my vagina, but then the secondary thought is that my underwear was removed. I am wheeled to the recovery room and the nurse casually removes the tube and hands me my underwear in a plastic baggie.\n\nDuring the whole healing process, I wondered what a tube up the vagina could be used for. I wasn't on my period, so it wasn't used to prevent blood leaking, it isn't an IV that gives anesthesia or fluids, or pain killers. I raked my brain and couldn't figure out. I was also upset because no one mentioned that my underwear would be removed, especially, not by me, but while I was under, and it wasn't implicit such as removing my bra so they could cut my rib cartilage, or let's say, a patient with a hernia knowing to remove their underwear for the surgery. I was too awkward to ask what the tube was for.\n\nWhen I got access to internet, I searched up what the tube was for, not really know what I was looking for but keywords were \"Tube, vagina, and rhinoplasty\", I mostly got results for labiaplasty and vaginal reconstruction but couldn't find a results for a tube up the vagina in the case of a Rhinoplasty, or anything besides vaginal reconstruction, actually. Am I being paranoid? Or is there a reason for tubes up the vagina? If it means anything, I was in Korea because of their expertise in Asian faces, and I'm 18.\n\nNot sure if I'm in the right thread but I figured doctors or surgeons would know what the various tubes used during surgery are used for.And not really relevant to the question, more to the thread, but I'm 18, East Asian, 5'5 and anywhere from 110 pounds to 115.\n\nEdit: Surgery lasted no more than 4 hours, a catheter is being suggested but it was in my vagina, not urethra, so I'm not sure. The forums online are saying that catheters are not usually used for rhinoplasty, so now I'm even more confused."
