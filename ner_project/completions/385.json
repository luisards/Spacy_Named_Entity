    "reddit": "42\nMale\n5'10\"\n215lbs\n\nI was referred to a cardiologist after my family doctor sent me for an EKG and found a right bundle branch block.\n\nThe cardiologist thinks the bundle branch block is hereditary and benign, but noticed that the \"pressure was a little high in my lungs\" -- which I  later figured out he was referring to pulomanory arterial arterial pressure...\n\nHe suggested a sleep study for sleep apnea, but I have very severe OCD and insomnia, so I figured the results might not be very helpful.  \n\nI have a few questions:\n- could hyperventilation cause a rise in pulmonary arterial pressure?\n- can systemic high blood pressure affect pulmonary arterial pressure, and if so, can both be elevated by stress or lack of sleep?\n- I jog 6 days a week (and have done so for 10 years, ever since losing a lot of weight) -- can jogging create this effect, and can taking a reading shortly after exertion affect pulmonary arterial pressure readings?\n\nThanks in advance!"
