    "reddit": "Age: 19\nSex: f\nWeight: 120 lbs\nHeight: 5'5\"\nDuration: a few days\nLocation: stomach/abdomen \n\nI was in the ER last night for really bad stomach pains (told them my pain was a 7) and was diagnosed with \"generalized abdominal pain.\" Which is great and all but maybe someone else might just know more specifically? It still hurts just as much as it did the next day and I'm very nervous to go to work (yesterday work was very hard for me). \n\nThe cramping started in my stomach in the morning and quickly progressed down into my upper intestines, spanning all the way across my body. The pain felt like my stomach and intestines themselves were clenching really hard, whilst also being squeezed on the outside too. The pain was persistent and constant, but the cramps and nausea would come more severely in waves. I was incredibly nauseous all day long but couldn't throw up no matter how hard I tried. Eventually my pain just got to the point where I couldn't just sit around any longer and went to the doctor for help. \nPrior to this, I'd eaten possibly bad pork and started to have stomach pain for a couple days, then the next day no pain at all really. The next day after that is when my pain became really bad. \nAside from stomach pain, I've also just been repeatedly dehydrated. Partly my stomach hurts so much I can't even drink water without it being in pain. My urethra has been burning off and on. Currently as of writing this it's burning again the morning after. \n\nThey took my blood and urine, then hooked me up to some IVs for a couple hours. The doctor pressed on my stomach and it was very sore where the pain was, she thumped on my back and it was sore where my kidneys were. They took a pregnancy test and I'm not pregnant. Eventually all my labs came back and nothing seemed wrong, it all came back negative. They gave me some anti nausea medicine which mostly worked, but I could still feel my cramps and very minimal nausea. \n\nAt the end of the day they prescribed me dicyclomine and ondansentron. I'm going to pick them up and really crossing my fingers they help out. \nThey told me if the pain is still persisting for more than five days I may want to see a stomach specialist. \n\nAdditional information: I'm recently sexually active, I suffer anxiety (and my mom and friend know how much I hate my job, they think my stomach pain is from how bad my anxiety is), I just started my period this morning (but have NEVER experienced any sort of period pain like this, it's usually just in my uterus and lower back). \n\nI'm in so much pain I'm desperate for answers. I know the doctors told me everything they could, they did everything they could for me. But I'm hoping maybe a stomach specialist is on here with any sort of ideas? I just can't stand this pain it hurts to do anything but sleep.\n\nEDIT: I don't have any chronic bowel disorders, IBS rubs in my family though. Over the past few days nothing has seemed abnormal about my bowels. No conscription or diarrhea. I can't remember the last time I used the bathroom but within a couple days I'm sure of, I do tend to notice if it's a little wonky even if I don't track that stuff."
