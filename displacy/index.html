. So around tuesday i felt i stepped into something in our kitchen (it's like a part of a fruit, like apple or something like that). There was a little blood but no too much and the wound is very-very little. But i'm afraid to get tetanus or something. AFAIK i got 4 tetanus shot in my life (3 mandatory vaccine (last when i was around 12) and one &quot;booster&quot; when i got shot at age 9 ( https://i.imgur.com/dxN50QH.png ).</br></br>Pictures about the &quot;injury&quot; and the thing i stepped into:</br></br>https://imgur.com/a/DsOsUKQ</br></br>Feel free to laugh about my case, but it's not so easy if you are that hypochondriac like me.</br></br>I think its a very minor injury but please calm me down! :D</div>

, but I almost felt a bit of &quot;air hunger&quot; and a bit weak, but my temperature was mostly back to normal. I had drank a bunch of Gatorade the night before and today was continuing to drink a bit more. At around 5pm I noticed a little &quot;lump&quot; on my upper left abdomen area that looks like this &amp;gt;  [https://i.imgur.com/CVeGpTC.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/CVeGpTC.jpg). I also vomited once that day.</br></br>The next morning (July 31st) the lump was still there but I think the &quot;air hunger&quot; was gone. But I vomited again that day, and decided to go to a medical clinic and the physician there had said that nothing was amiss when felt it, so I started to get a bit of relief from that. My bowel movements have been consistently runny or coming out in small &quot;pebbles&quot; ever since the first day and were still doing that even today.</br></br>Now on August 1st is where I started to get really worried, for some of the day I felt really &quot;out of it&quot; but eventually I recovered from it. Later that day I think my fingernails went slightly discolored (purple-like) and my foot also slightly discolored whenever I put it down for a long amount of time. Also have slight &quot;bursts&quot; of pain in all of them every now and then. Later that day I \*THINK\*, but not 100% sure, that there might be another slight tight part of my left arm a bit lower than the location of my elbow, and as well as something going on with my left calf, but again, I cannot confirm 100% if this is new or just me noticing things being different from my right side of my body, picture of Calfs &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;  [https://i.imgur.com/75Rtdo0.png](https://i.imgur.com/75Rtdo0.png) It also feels &quot;harder&quot; to the touch then my right calf.</br></br>This morning coincidentally had an appointment with a nurse practitioner and not noticing any new symptoms I don't believe, while I was there I figured it wouldn't hurt to ask about this anyways, she took blood pressure and listened to my heart and all looked normal to her, blood pressure was 124/70. She listened to my breathing and didn't say anything, so I was assuming it was normal. I showed the calf and she said that doesnt feel like theres any &quot;nodules&quot;. I did not vomit this morning or yesterday morning, but still feeling general fatigue.</br></br>I'm not sure what to do and I am scared that I may have a serious illness such as

. After about a month, when I wasn't seeing any effects, the dose was increased to 300 mg. A few days after the increase, I started feeling extremely dizzy. I decreased the dose over the course of 2 weeks. It has been an additional two weeks and the dizziness has only gotten worse.</br></br>I am constantly either dizzy or lightheaded, and it is worse when standing, moving, or exercising. It is less noticeable in the morning, and gets worse as the day goes on.</br></br>I have had similar experiences of dizziness while taking 125 mg sertraline, 10 mg escitalopram, and 40 mg fluoxitine in the past, which caused me to discontinue each of the medications.

Is this pain gerd or could still be cardiac? </br></br>A few days ago i might have had food poisoning because i felt nauseous, lost my appetite and didn’t enjoy cannibis anymore. I also felt heartburn especially when my stomach was empty, and indigestion after eating. I thought all pointed to a heart attack, so to prove myself wrong i ran on the treadmill for 15 minutes, covering 1.4 miles. Nothing too bad, but i had mild heartburn after. </br></br>Sometimes i feel like it got harder for me to breathe too. Not sure if

?</br></br>The thing is, sometimes the pain from the heartburn goes away, and gets replaced with a tight muscle- sort of feeling on my left chest. </br></br>Also, there has been this mild but sharp shooting pain that throbs down my left arm, and sometimes i feel tightness in my neck too. My left wrist recently bumped into a sharp table corner, and was bruised. Also, i notice very very small purple webs, but they are more like 2 or 3 threads, on my left arm. Nothing major loke in the webmd symptoms, but not sure what it signifies. </br></br>Overall, I’m not sure if this is from running 2 miles after a period of not running, or from skipping rope, or actually all are related to a cardiac event. </br></br>I might be overly paranoid because upon exertion most of the time the symptoms disappear, but also sometimes the heartburn shows up after exercise. </br></br>BTW, i had a 12-lead EKG about two months ago, and a chest x-ray from the ER, but no blood test because i didn’t want to face the needle unless i absolutely have to. The doctor said despite me thinking i had a heart attack it was

I used to take fluoxetine, and later changed it to paroxetine. I was slowly increasing the dose to 40mg and the sensation appeared. I also take Lamitrin, but for a long time now. So I associate it mostly with new drug. It's been happening for over 6 months now.</br></br>Basically sometimes during the day, especially in the evening, I get this 'zap' sensation when I move my eyes to sides. It almost feels like an electric shock, it also feels as it's pulsating. It doesn't hurt, but makes me very uncomfortable and a little dizzy. I thought I'm going insane, so obviously I used google, and found out there are other people experiencing this AND what's interesting, many of them are on antidepressants (mostly paroxetine) or just stopped taking them. I mentioned that to my psychiatrist, yet I know how it sounds like... She thinks it's just a vertigo. </br></br>It really affects my life, because sometimes I don't want to move my body or look at anything. It only happens when I move my eyes, and only for a short period of time each day. Sometimes I feel it gets worse when I take my medications later than usually, but at the same time it's still happening when I'm taking them on time. </br></br>After I'm done with University (in 2 months) psychiatrist wants me to get off paroxetine.

 it causes. I have previously been to an ENT about this, who did not find anything unusual - although he did comment that my throat muscles looked tightened, but I believe this may have just been because I was tensing up due to being anxious about the examination.</br></br>I guess my first concern is to rule out the possibility of it being heart related, although I already doubt this option since the symptoms are nearly constant regardless of physical activity. I've had a 24h holter monitor before, which confirmed the PVC's, but found nothing else unusual. I've had an ultrasound before and know my heart is structurally normal. My pulse and blood pressure are also fine.</br></br>If we can rule that out, I really would just like to get to the bottom of this problem finally that has been bothering me for months, so I can live normally again.

, lactose intolerance</br>Medication: 60mg Cymbalta, 300mg Wellbutrin</br>Drug use: occasional alcohol use</br>Smoking status: never smoked</br></br>Hi. So 5 days ago I noticed my bellybutton was having some issues. It was &quot;crusty&quot; inside and painful. It felt like a sunburn, but my bellybutton has not been exposed to any sun. On day 3, I noticed it was more red and there was a ring of brown &quot;crust&quot; around my belly button. I washed it off and it didn't come back. But, since I first noticed symptoms, a firm, white lump has begun to form inside my bellybutton. The surrounding area is red, but the lump itself is pure white. It is still mildly painful, but when it comes in contact with clothing (especially when I bend down and my Jean's press into it) it becomes very painful, almost like touching an open wound. There has been a little bit of clear discharge that doesn't have a smell, but the lump itself doesn't seem to be leaking or draining. I have been applying Neosporin, but it doesn't seem to be improving. It's actually getting worse if anything. Over the past week I've been having some stomach issues (gas, nausea, diarrhea, etc.) as well as a lot of fatigue no matter how much or little I sleep, but I have been attributing that to increasing the dosage of my antidepressant, as these are the symptoms I usually get when my dose is increased. </br></br>Should I go to a doctor, or is this not a big deal?

<div class="entities" style="line-height: 2.5; direction: ltr">Hello,</br></br>I am posting here mainly because I feel like I've exhausted all options. I realize it's a bit ridiculous to be posting on a Reddit forum for medical opinions, but the doctors I've seen in real life seem largely unconcerned with my health problems and are unwilling to explore any options beyond the common/obvious, which have already been ruled out.</br></br>I am 27, female, and live in western Canada. I am white, 5'4&quot;, and 135lbs. My symptoms have been ongoing for a little over 7 months. I'm not on any medications (have a Mirena IUD though), and I don't have any pre-existing medical conditions before this. I traveled to Nepal and Thailand in the fall, and got home about a two weeks before my symptoms started... don't know if it's relevant.</br></br>At the end of December, I noticed a strange itch near the opening of my urethra. I went to the local sexual health clinic, but the

 there said she didn't think it was an STI and it was probably just a skin irritation. I got the regular panel done, everything came back negative a week later, and I figured it would just resolve on its own. However, around January 9th or so, I had tingles in my outer labia and irritation/itch/pain around my vaginal opening. I went to see a doctor at my university clinic, he said nothing looked unusual, and he ordered the standard STI tests, along with an IgG test for herpes, and swabs for yeast and mycoplasma. Everything came back negative again. I contacted my most recent partner, and he got the standard panel and an IgG for herpes, and says everything was negative. </br></br>As time goes on, my symptoms expand to aching skin in my genital region, itchy skin all over my groin area (butt cheeks, mons pubis, anus, etc.), consistent tingles in my outer labia, aching legs and sometimes arms (all the way does to my toes, feels like the inside of my limbs are burning). In April, a lump appeared in my groin that may or may not be a swollen lymph node and that hasn't gone away since (going on 4 months with that now, yay). There also appear to be tiny, tiny skin coloured bumps near my urethral opening that are pretty much always there as far as I can tell. And I'm tired a lot of the time. Sometimes the best way I can describe what I'm feeling is it feels like my entire lower body has the

, plus also weird tingles and itches.</br></br>I've been tested for herpes with an IgG test 3 times - 4 weeks post exposure, 13 weeks, and 17 weeks. All negative. I decided to get a Western Blot done because I was losing my mind, and had to go to Seattle to get it since the test isn't available in Canada. This was also negative, so between 3 negative IgGs, a negative Western Blot at over 6 months post exposure, and my &quot;partner's&quot; negative IgG, I'm pretty much 100% sure I don't have herpes... not to mention I haven't had any blisters, every doctor I've seen said it doesn't look like herpes, and I don't have any patterns resembling &quot;outbreaks&quot; - my symptoms basically just come and go at random. </br></br>I'm wondering if it's a bizarre

, or something autoimmune, or one friend suggested I get tested for lyme disease? I'm honestly at my wits' end. I've seen 5 doctors and 3 sexual health nurses and no one has tested me for anything except STIs and yeast infections, even when I tried to get them to test for more outside the box things. I'm really at the end of my rope here - depressed, feeling like I can't live a normal life, like I'll never have a relationship again, and like no one cares about what's happening to me.</br></br>Has anyone ever encountered anything like this? I really need answers. Please.</div>

</br>No current medications</br></br>HI guys, I would like some input about what could be wrong with me.</br>Friday evening, while chilling and feeling fine mentally, I suddenly felt this pressure pain on the left side of my chest. Right under my left boob. It was very noticeable and I couldn't get comfortable.</br>I was doubting to go to the hospital so decided to check my symptoms online. They didn't fit the heart attack symptoms, but about 2 min after the pain started I got extremely lightheaded, nauseaus and I heard this weird static sound in my head. I started breaking out into cold sweats.</br></br>I was convinced it was a panic attack (although this is nothing like any panic attack I had before) and decided to lay back and breathe through it. It lasted for about 5 min. And then I just decided to go to sleep and it will be over in de morning.</br>When waking up I still had the chest pain. It's mostly noticeable when exhaling and in certain positions. Inhaling doesn't hurt at all. But it does hurt in the middle of my back a bit now too. </br>My left arm is also a bit achy but nothing serious.</br>Moreso I'm extremely fatigued and have diarrhea now.</br></br>What could be wrong?

/surgery). This isn’t surprising though, as she had horrible, horrible muscle spasms for months after her last laparoscopy that required baclofen to treat. She had the IUD inserted in the OR under anesthesia.</br></br>Things seemed to be going alright for the first few days. Some cramping, but minimal. Now things have taken a turn for the worse. She had a semi-active day (just running some errands, nothing too strenuous) and in the evening she started having severe cramping/spasms. A small amount of bleeding too, but not very much at all. The pain is very intense. 20mg of baclofen and 600mg of naproxen barely touched it. Nearly an hour after taking the baclofen, she finally started to get a little bit better, to the point where she sat on the couch for a while in only moderate pain. She recently moved upstairs, and the pain is back and just as severe as before. She took additional Tylenol and it doesn’t seem to be helping. She describes the pain as similar to when she had spasms post-surgery, but maybe “a little different” (isn’t in a state to elaborate on what this means). </br></br>Here’s the thing - she has a history of *severe* pain, and a very high pain threshold. It takes a lot to send her to the ER. I think it’s only happened once before. My family is starting to think an ER visit is necessary, but she’s resisting for two reasons:</br></br>1. Her history of severe vaginismus is a confounding factor so it’s very hard to tell what level of pain is “normal”</br>2. She’s convinced that if she goes to the ER, they’ll insist on taking it out. She doesn’t want to do this because then the whole process of getting it inserted in the OR would have been a waste (and she wouldn’t have even gotten a chance to see if it helps with her headaches), and also because the process of removing it would likely be quite painful and traumatic without the help of some heavier-duty anesthetic. She can’t even have a normal pelvic exam (inserting one finger causes severe pain). I have no idea how someone would remove it. </br></br>She obviously hasn’t been able to check the string either. I’m at a loss of what to do. She’s determined to ride it out, but she’s been sobbing for hours now and I’m getting desperate.</div>

 as my primary care physician had exhausted all she could IMO to help treat it. I asked her for a referral and he was the only psychiatrist accepting new patients at the only clinic covered by my insurance. He switched me off of the Sertraline 100mg my PCP prescribed and put me on Mirtazapine 30mg. I had awful &quot;brain zaps&quot; for 3 weeks straight after the med switch. All this med has done is making me binge eat everything. I was at the clinic yesterday for my biweekly therapy and my therapist told me to leave a memo with the front desk to notify him and he had mentioned to call if there were any concerns. His medical assistant calls me yesterday and said he wants me to stop the mirtazapine and he will see me at my next appointment on September 20. I was like are you seriously advising me to go off my meds for a month? I don't understand why a mental health provider would ever have a patient stop a med cold turkey AND not prescribe something else?! This seems very negligent to me and I'm questioning his judgement and whether or not he should be my psychiatrist. Some background info on me: </br>24M, located in the United States</div>
