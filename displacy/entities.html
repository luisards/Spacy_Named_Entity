 and steroids. After my second surgery, I did not have an autoimmune flare, but I had a bad reaction with my heart. I had always gotten winded easily (even as a kid, I couldn't run around like the other kids my age without my heart racing out of my chest), but after my surgery, it got so bad that I had to sit on the floor to brush my teeth. After my echo showed MVP, I was diagnosed with hEDS by diagnostic criteria. I have not undergone genetic testing yet, but I will eventually.</br></br>The metoprolol helps immensely, but there are a couple of things it hasn't helped. First, my hands shake like crazy. You'd think I were really nervous or something, but it's just that my hands aren't steady. They don't feel weak, they just shake. It's not all the time. It comes and goes. But it's very annoying.</br></br>Second (and this is the main reason for my post), my pulse hurts sometimes. I get a pain in areas where I have major veins. Most commonly in my neck (carotid artery), but also once in my wrist, and today I got it in the top of my thigh. It usually lasts for about 5-10 seconds. I massage the area while it's happening because it feels like it needs it, and it usually goes away after a bit. It happens...maybe on average once a day? I don't think this happened before my second surgery, but I might just not have thought about it as much since my recent diagnoses.</br></br>My fear is that this could be indicative of a vascular component with my EDS. Clearly there is some vascular involvement, but it has been limited so far. My echo did not show aortic root dilation or any other issues apart from MVP. That being said, my first cardiologist was awful. He said my echo and ekg were both perfectly fine. I had to ask him three times to double check the results before he saw the MVP. And the ekg tech clearly reported

 on my ekg, which the doctor didn't even acknowledge. So I'm not confident something else wasn't missed on the echo, and I plan to ask my new cardiologist to take a look. He's a genetic cardiologist and should have an eye for what to look out for the most.</br></br>If anyone can provide any insight into what might be causing the pain and whether or not I should be worried, I would greatly appreciate it.</br></br>Thanks so much!</div>

I use an app to track it and I'm always right on time each month. However, 1 week after my last period last month I noticed very light spotting. Then 2 weeks after my last period it started becoming medium flow. All the blood is dark brown. Enough flow to need a pantyliner. This has lasted 9 days now. My periods are always heavy and last 6 days, and with this bleeding being right in the middle of my cycle, I know that this is definitely not my period.

, normal heartrate, my foggy head cleared and I didn’t need to sleep so much, no more pelvic and flank pain. It was pretty great.</br> </br> </br>For a month... And then the god damned vein scarred shut and everything came back worse. The general consensus was that the occluded left renal vein was causing low perfusion pressure, raising renin, raising aldosterone and angiotensin, causing the crazy BP swings. The blood that should have been going from the kidney to the IVC and up to the heart was refluxing down into the ovarian vein and pelvic plexus, causing low cardiac preload, tachycardia. Makes sense!</br></br> </br>So we cut out my fucking kidney on Monday. I guess my body had created tons of weird little inefficient collateral veins so it was a thing but all went well and my numbers were decent in the hospital so I came home Tuesday.</br></br> </br>But my blood pressure and heartrate have steadily climbed the last few days and I feel worse than ever. Just laying in bed, my numbers used to be low, like 100/60, HR 50s. But not they’re like 150/110, HR 130. It won’t go down. I’m talking my meds, drinking plenty of water. Wtf is wrong???</br> </br> </br>My doctors don’t know what to tell me. I’m scared and angry and don’t understand how I could possible get worse by cutting out the problem.</div>

I went on a road trip, and it mostly went away then except for sometimes while I was driving. Last week it also went away for a bit—after my massage, I was starting to get stiff again, put tried tucking my shoulder blades back and that seemed to work. Kept with that until now, where it’s no longer working.</div>

<div class="entities" style="line-height: 2.5; direction: ltr">Issue - I've pretty much lost my thirst and appetite. I can easily go a day without any normal and healthy signs of hunger. Only the occasional intense, but short lived bout of nausea. This is not normal for me at all. This time a year ago my appetite was very healthy.</br></br>I work in a fairly physical environment, where being in descent shape is essential and am certain that im burning a lot of calories, but when I go to sit down with my colleagues, I notice they have 3 times as much food on there plates as I do. I'm certainly in caloric deficit a good percentage of the time.  I'm also a cyclist and I ride about 50km a day. In spite of this, I still have to remind myself to eat and I rarely feel ravenous in the way that I used to.</br></br>Over the past decade my weight has fluctuated. Both in terms of muscle mass and fat. I've also had year long periods of making concerted effort to gain muscle through eating a lot. Overeating. After that I held a little too much weight and then slowly managed to work it off.</br></br>I guess its also important to mention that I didn't really realise I was fat until one day I saw a photograph of myself. It came as a bit of a shock.  I know that sounds odd, but really, I just hadn't seen it. No idea how or why. Body dysmorphia or something. But when I did finally see it, it didn't make me feel great. It came as a bit of a shock and I felt stupid that I hadn't seen it and worried what my weight gain communicated to other people, especially when it really matters in my field of work. It also bothered me that nobody close to me had asked if everything was okay. But that's a whole other thing!</br></br>I'm worried that the medication (provided below)  i'm taking currently, or the medication I took previously, has had a permanent effect of my sense of appetite. I'm now losing weight beyond the point that I'd like. I also worry whether fluctuating physical goals  and body self image has had an effect on me psychologically.</br></br>Thank-you very much for reading and any advice, thoughts or solutions appreciated!

Was given Nexium and symptoms (nausea/bloatedness) cleared up in a couple of weeks.</br></br>2 weeks ago I started getting similar symptoms (without the bloody vomit) so went to pharmacist who gave me omeprazole 20mg to take once a day in the morning. </br></br>Symptoms are as follows, with reference to this image (https://imgur.com/LWwb7kv) as I'm not great at explaining anatomy! All symptoms have been slowly getting worse. There's mild cramping all over my abdomen, but I highlighted the more problematic areas.</br></br>- A lot of belching/nausea in the morning</br>- Loose stools every morning, sometimes multiple and often urgent. Foul smelling and the more liquid parts are brown-orange and greasy</br>- Cramping worst in morning with the area marked 'x' being the worst. Feels like I have been doing sit ups</br>- Bouts of pain anywhere on the drawn area happen throughout the day, sometimes in heart area, sometimes on opposite side. Back/side pain on the right gets worse throughout day</br>- Appetite much smaller due to nausea while eating, burping helps relieve this somewhat</br>- Pain everywhere is mostly on the dull side, but heart area pain/mirrored right side can get a little sharp</br></br>I've cut out drinking, spicy foods, any drink other than water, don't smoke, but no luck. Stress appears to make it worse. I've always had nausea/loose stools when stressed/anxious, but current symptoms are still present (and started) when I am not stressed at all </br></br>Any thoughts would be appreciated, thank you!</div>

Slurred speech &amp;amp; worsening auras (including vertigo) soon followed. </br></br>I had an EEG done &amp;amp; was diagnosed with a seizure disorder.

On my 3rd dose of it today. My question is, I've had increased issues w/ vertigo since coming off Keppra and starting the Lamictal. Lamictal lists vertigo as a side effect. Does it seem more probable that the vertigo is from 3-days worth of Lamictal or would it be more likely that my seizure disorder is acting up? None of the above? Not sure if it's worth bugging my neurologist about just yet or if I should wait to get better used to the Lamictal first before consulting her. </br></br>Also, is the feeling of skin crawling a common side effect of Lamictal? Is it dangerous? I don't have a rash, I'm just itchy. I was warned that a rash could be bad.</div>

 when I see other people eating, used plates or cutlery, videos of people eating, the thought of a food fight makes me feel sick. I am recovering from an eating disorder but I dont think it is to do with that. My fear started when i was young with meat and things (vegetarian) and now I cant be in the same room as people with most foods. When I worked at a restaurant I had to state i would not wash dishes as I am terrified of other peoples foods. One time they made me wash up and I had to go outside to throw up. When I was collecting dishes from the breakfast bar I would feel so physically ill that sometimes I would just hide instead of doing it. Washing tables was awful aswell as polishing cutlery. Working there made eating out for me now impossible. When my boyfriend is eating infront of me i feel sick and make him brush his teeth and wash his hands. I will freak out if there is food crumbs anywhere. Some of the worst things are meats and ketchup and liquidy foods or things with chunks. Its getting worse and worse over the years. It only got this bad when I was in recovery but Ive always had a thing about meat and smells (autistic spectrum disorder) and ive always been fussy about textures and wont eat most foods (wont eat meats, dairy, breads, most sauces ect.) but this is something that ive never heard of before? There isnt anything online about it. Ive heard of people hating chewing sounds which i also do but its so far beyond that. Anyone know anything about what could be wrong??</div>

I've always loved vegetables so I've always eaten a lot of them but I also ate a lot of junk (fries, pizza, nuggets, chips, etc.). Then, this past summer I suffered a major depressive episode.

 but this was my first depressive episode. I alternated between not having the energy or desire to eat much of anything to only eating junk. I didn't gain weight but I felt like crap. I ended up going to the hospital because of the

I'm less afraid to talk to people now and my motivation regarding my work has increased. I have more energy. My doctor also prescribed iron supplements and magnesium supplements (prescription strength) which I've been taking as prescribed.  </br></br></br>I cut down my alcohol intake.

 set in, I was sort of a workaholic and wouldn't go to bed until 2:00am most nights. Now, I'm usually in bed around 12:30 and I take at least an hour to relax before bed. </br></br>I made big dietary changes. I now only eat red meat once a month. I mostly eat beans and legumes, plenty of vegetables, nuts, fatty fish and olive oil, occasional poultry (maybe once a week), and healthy grains (quinoa, oats, barley, etc.). I feel awesome. I don't eat many fruits but that's because I've never been much into sweets. For fruits I eat a handful of berries here and there or I add a banana to my unsweetened oats in the morning. I drink a lot more water, too. My doctor told me not to cut out all junk because it isn't sustainable long-term for most people. Every two weeks I allow myself a &quot;cheat&quot; night where I indulge in ONE thing I really like. Last time it was a small poutine. This time it's going to be samosas.   </br></br></br>I've increased my activity. I'm not going to the gym all the time but I walk about 20-35 minutes almost every day and I go swimming once a week. I have a really demanding career so it's hard to get exercise time in. I hope to increase it in the future.   </br></br></br>**Questions:**   </br></br></br>1. I've had well-meaning friends say I'm not doing the right thing in terms of diet and that in order to lower cholesterol I need to consume less carbs. One friend said I should cut out the beans/legumes and healthy grains and concentrate on proteins and fats. She follows keto. Is the diet I described above ok or is there something I can do better? I'm not trying to lose weight, I just want to be healthy. In fact, I really don't want to lose ANY weight.</br>2. How else can I increase my activity in a way that won't take up too much time every day? I'm assuming my small change in activity (the walking and swimming) won't do much health-wise even though it's making me feel better.</br>3. A family member told me to stop my Celexa and look to herbs like St. John's Wort instead. She said that antidepressants cause addiction, change your personality, and over time can ruin creativity and cognitive functioning. This kind of sounds like bull to me but is there any truth to these claims? I'm doing really well on the medication. I'm finally not in a constant state of panic or

These are the worst he’s ever had. To the point he throws up. To the point he has to lay in bed all day in complete silence and darkness because his head hurts too much to get up. It’s horrible to watch and I don’t know what to do. He was up all night last night and the pain was so bad he was thinking about going to the hospital. And if my dad wants to go to the hospital, you know it’s bad. OTC pain meds don’t work, he’s read that high amounts of caffeine help so he tries drinking that but it only works sometimes.

 and when he’s drinking red bull AND coffee AND taking OTC pain meds that contain caffeine it kind of makes me cringe. He has a dr appt scheduled for tomorrow because he just can’t deal with them anymore but I was hoping maybe I could get some advice for him on ways to deal with them or maybe a medication or something to ask his doctor about. He currently has one right now after being up all night from having one last night. Please help with any advice!!! </br></br>Thanks!</div>

 as a kid. </br></br>The issue:</br></br>I cannot run. I can try to run, key word is TRY. Just running a very short distance, like shorter than a block, I get this God awful pain. It's usually in my sides like underneath my breasts, the rib area kind of. Not only that I can't breath, like I can but I'm borderline heaving and my throat feels so bad as I try and calm my breathing down. I have had this issue since I was a kid, I can do other exercises but trying to sprint causes such an immense pain I feel like I'm going to throw up. I don't even run that fast and these like episodes happen to me, it's really sad. I currently see a cardiologist but he blows off my worries when I tell him about this.</div>
